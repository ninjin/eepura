T1003	Span 535 608	suggesting that Hfq may normally down regulate expression within the host
T1004	Speculation 866 873	suggest
E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 866 1090	suggest Hfq plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of several two component systems including three that have been shown to be essential for virulence in a variety of animal models; SsrA/B, PhoP/Q, and OmpR/EnvZ
T1006	Negation 658 660	no
E1003	Negation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 658 725	no change in the corresponding mRNA levels relative to the wildtype

E1004	Speculation:T1008 Scope:T1009
T1009	Span 2653 2786	suggests that Hfq regulates motility and invasion at the transcription level, presumably by modulating one of the upstream regulators

T1011	Span 1651 1692	no effect on transcription of these genes

E1006	Negation:T1012 Scope:T1013
T1013	Span 2822 2889	not made at high levels and thus difficult to identify and quantify
