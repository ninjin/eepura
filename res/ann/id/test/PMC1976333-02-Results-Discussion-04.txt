Identifying Flagellar Components through Bacteriophage chi Selection 
As a complementary approach to determining the components necessary for a functioning flagellum, we designed a simple selection to identify mutants resistant to chi-phage infection. Bacteriophage chi infects E. coli by attaching to and traveling along flagellar filaments [24]. CCW flagellar rotation and the correct pattern of grooves on the surface of the flagellum are thought to drive chi-phage down the filament to the surface of the membrane, very similar to how a nut follows the grooves of a rotating bolt [25]. The library of transposon insertional mutants was exposed to chi-phage in an environment conducive to motility (Figure 2A). Survival of a mutant meant either the loss of its flagella, the loss of flagellar CCW rotation, or the loss of other components necessary for infection. In a sample of mutants taken after selection, 98% were completely nonmotile (Figure S4). Figure 2B shows the distribution of z-scores after library selection upon exposure to bacteriophage chi, and the complete microarray results for duplicate selections can be found in Datasets S5 and S6. As expected, insertional mutations in flagellar genes conferred resistance to chi-phage infection. In contrast, while mutants of the chemotaxis sensory network were in high abundance after the chemotaxis selection, insertional mutants of cheA, cheB, cheR, cheW, tap, tar, trg, and tsr were in low abundance after exposure to chi-phage. This is to be expected, since null mutations in these genes do not entirely abolish CCW flagellar rotation. The only exception among the che genes is cheZ, whose z-score of +8.7 indicates a CW flagellar rotation bias and reduced susceptibility to chi-phage infection. CheZ is a phosphatase of CheY, the protein whose phosphorylated state biases the flagella toward the CW direction [26,27]. Therefore, in the absence of CheZ, CheY is maintained in the phosphorylated state, "locking" flagellar rotation in the CW direction, and hence minimizing infection by chi-phage. In addition to these findings, the selection results revealed that cellular structures other than the flagella may be required for infection (Table S1). The role these structures play in chi-phage infection and the impact they have on motility are discussed in a separate section below.
