<sentence id="0">The Role of the C-di-GMP Second-Messenger System in Swimming and Swarming Motility</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Based on sequence homology , YhjH , YfgF , and YegE belong to the newly identified and highly prevalent family of proteins that function in the turnover of bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate ( c-di-GMP ) , which is a second messenger involved in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial behaviors [ 49 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Synthesis of c-di-GMP is catalyzed by diguanylate cyclases ( DGC ) and its degradation is regulated by phosphodiesterases ( PDE ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities have been attributed to GGDEF and EAL protein domains , respectively [ 50,51 ] , and the activity of these domains is known to have opposite effects on motility [ 52 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">YhjH contains an EAL domain , and expression of this protein leads to the degradation of c-di-GMP and enhanced motility in S. enterica [ 52 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Based on this observation and because EAL domain proteins function in the degradation of c-di-GMP , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that the motility defect of DeltayhjH ( Figure 1C ) is a result of increased intracellular levels of c-di-GMP</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">YegE and YfgF both contain an EAL domain C-terminal to a GGDEF domain ( Figure 6G ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The presence of domains of opposing activities in a single protein complicates functional inferences .</sentence>

<sentence id="11">We argue that YfgF has an active EAL domain and functions as a PDE based on three observations : ( 1 ) expression of this gene enhances motility of the DeltayhjH strain ( Figure 6E ) ; ( 2 ) the amino acid sequence of YfgF shows similarity to enzymatically active EAL domains ( Figure S10 ) ; and ( 3 ) the amino acid sequence <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lacks</cue> a complete GGDEF motif needed for DGC activity <scope type="neg" id="4">( data <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Likewise , three observations <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggest</cue> that the EAL domain in YegE is inactive and that this protein functions primarily as a DGC : ( 1 ) deletion of YegE enhances motility of the DeltayhjH strain ( Figure 6F ) ; ( 2 ) the amino acid sequence of the EAL domain in YegE is <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> consistent with an enzymatically active form ( Figure S10 ) ; and ( 3 ) YegE contains an intact GGDEF motif</scope> <scope type="neg" id="6">( data <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Based on these observations , we <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">propose</cue> that deleting yegE and over-expressing yfgF suppress the motility defect of the DeltayhjH strain by reducing the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP ( Figure 7 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Deletion of yegE and over-expression of yfgF did <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> have significant effects on the motility of the wild-type strain</scope> ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">E. coli has 19 genes encoding proteins with GGDEF domains [ 55 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">If c-di-GMP levels act globally and can influence motility , then insertions in many of the genes containing active GGDEF domains <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">should</cue> rescue motility in the DeltayhjH double mutant library</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">However , the results of the genome-wide screen for suppressors of the DeltayhjH motility defect reveals that this is not the case ( Table S2 ) .</sentence>

<sentence id="20">The manner in which c-di-GMP alters motility at the molecular level is currently unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">However , it has been reported that c-di-GMP binds to the PilZ domain of the aforementioned YcgR protein [ 48 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">It is <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">hypothesized</cue> that YcgR undergoes a conformational change upon binding to c-di-GMP , and that the YcgR-c-di-GMP complex impairs motility through a protein-protein interaction with the flagellar motor [ 57</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Such an interaction <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">may</cue> explain the observed rotational bias of flagella in DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6B ) and is in agreement with our finding that mutations in ycgR strongly suppress the motility defects of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6F )</scope> .</sentence>
