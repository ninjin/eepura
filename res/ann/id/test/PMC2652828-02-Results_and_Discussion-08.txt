Summary 
Post-transcriptional regulation has not been directly examined on a global scale by proteomic methods. This work has focused on two translational regulators in Salmonella (Hfq and SmpB) that are required for virulence. In order to accurately characterize global control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level it is essential to measure global changes in both transcript and protein levels. We performed a sample-matched global proteomics and transcriptional analysis to examine the broad impacts of deletion mutants of hfq and smpB on global protein and transcript abundance levels to begin to understand how Hfq and SmpB mediate the control of global gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Using a sample-matched procedure our strategy simultaneously measures changes in global transcript and protein abundance levels allowing for a clear distinction between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of Hfq or SmpB. Furthermore, our strategy requires no tagging and or isolation of Hfq or SmpB precluding the possibility of spurious results introduced by tagging and or co- immunoprecipitation processes. Previous attempts to identify processes/targets regulated by Hfq, and thus targets of sRNA regulation, have relied on transcript-centric approaches. In one study microarray analysis was used to identify changes in gene expression resulting from lack of Hfq, thus providing potential new target genes for sRNA regulation [27]. High-density oligonucleotide microarrays were used to detect sRNA and other targets of Hfq co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq-specific antibodies [26]. Most recently high-throughput pyrosequencing (HTPS) was used to detect message and sRNA bound to Hfq following immunoprecipitation [10]. The result of this work was very surprising namely that Hfq bound to 20% of all Salmonella mRNA transcripts and at least 64 small RNA molecules. One possible criticism of this work is that the RNA co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq may be brought down simply because Hfq strongly binds to RNA molecules and that the binding is somewhat non-specific. Our efforts presented here support the conclusions of that study and suggest that an even larger number of Salmonella proteins are translationally regulated than the 20% suggested by these authors, when accessed across a larger number of growth conditions. We have compared wildtype and isogenic hfq and smpB derivatives with matched samples to examine both transcription and translation by global proteomics. There were some cases in which a change in protein level could be related to a change in transcription but this was the exception. These results suggest that while feedback mechanisms between protein abundance and transcript levels exist, the majority of the effects observed here for both hfq and smpB are a result of direct modulation of post-transcriptional events. These results have been validated by Western blotting to a number of proteins. The amount of translational regulation varied with growth conditions. During growth in rich media approximately 14% of all proteins observed showed differences in abundance where as in acidic minimal media the result was approximately21%. Taking into account all growth conditions about approximately50% of all observed proteins are regulated by Hfq an astonishingly high number. These results may explain the very high LD50 of the hfq mutant strain (>109 i.p.) and its growth defect even in rich media. It has recently been shown that half of all the known sRNAs in Salmonella associate with Hfq [10]. It is interesting to note that in adaptive evolution experiments using a chemostat to continuously alter grow conditions often results in changes in Hfq (Bernard Palsson, UCSD, personal communication). It has long been known that many proteins are transcriptionally regulated. These results and the results recently described by Sittka et al. [10] demonstrate that post-transcriptional/translational regulation plays as large a role in controlling the myriad of bacterial processes as does transcriptional regulation. It is the precisely this ability to rapidly adjust to changing conditions in less time than it takes to make an RNA molecule that makes this a pivotal regulatory process.
