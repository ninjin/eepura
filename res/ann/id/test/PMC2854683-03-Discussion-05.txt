Concluding remarks 
In conclusion, we have established a model that allowed us to resolve two sets of complex transcriptional events: (i) those occurring in response to the host environment and (ii) those caused by a mutation in covS sensor kinase. We believe that our results offer a proof of principle that in vivo-extracted RNA can provide transcriptional profiles that better reflect the complexity of heterogeneous bacterial communities, and, as shown in this study, can provide a transcriptional snapshot of a bacterial population right before its extinction. The use of in vivo-driven RNA in understanding virulence has been appreciated in streptococcal research [73], but the technique has not previously been used to explain the switch to hypervirulent, invasive phenotypes or to dissect heterogeneous microbial subpopulations. This study is a first step towards exploring the sociomicrobiology of invasive GAS in vivo. Having captured snapshots of different transcriptional programs within the same bacterial community, we plan to follow with single cell studies [74], [75] of bacteria associated with immune cells to further dissect the different roles played by members of the same bacterial community.
