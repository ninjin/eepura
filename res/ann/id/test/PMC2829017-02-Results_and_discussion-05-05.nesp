<sentence id="0">e) Up-regulated genes which are conserved and predicted to code for OMPs or lipoproteins</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The main goal of our experiment was to identify genes that were expressed in vivo during infection of the natural host .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We were also interested by genes showing high-level of sequence conservation among different field and reference strains [ 25 ] , and coding for proteins predicted to localize to the outer membrane [ 71 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Three genes satisfied those criteria : two that are coding for outer membrane proteins ( APL_0959 and irp ) , and one coding for a lipoprotein ( APL_0920 ) ( see Additional file 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The irp ( iron responsive protein ) gene codes for a predicted TonB-dependant receptor , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> involved in hemin transport</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , since this was deduced from sequence homologies , the real function of irp in A. pleuropneumoniae cannot be reliably inferred , but it is conserved in various bacterial pathogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , the irp gene is located directly next to APL_0920 , a conserved lipoprotein in the L20 genome although they are transcribed in opposite directions .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The protein sequence deduced from the APL_0920 gene sequence is present in all sequenced A. pleuropneumoniae strains and in Mannheimia haemolytica PHL213 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> other strong homologies can be found in other bacterial species</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The APL_0959 gene codes for a hypothetical hemagglutinin/hemolysin-like outer membrane protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The protein sequence deduced from the gene sequence shares approximately 30 % identity with different large sections of the filamentous hemagglitinin/adhesin ( FhaB ) from bacteria of the Bordetella genus , which also colonize the respiratory tract of various mammalian hosts .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">While it was first identified for its hemagglutination properties [ 72 ] , FHA can bind carbohydrates , heparan sulphate and integrin [ 73 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">It is the most important adhesin in B. pertussis , and deletion of FHA in B. bronchiseptica , another important swine respiratory pathogen , caused lower colonization than the wild-type strain at all respiratory tract sites tested with was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">unable</cue> to cause disease</scope> [ 74 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The A. pleuropneumoniae FHA homolog is conserved amongst all field and reference strains previously tested [ 25 ] , and <scope type="spec" id="3"> was <cue type="spec" id="3">predicted</cue> to locate to the outer membrane [ 71</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In B. bronchiseptica , <scope type="spec" id="4"> FhaB is <cue type="spec" id="4">believed</cue> to be important early in the infection process in order to allow colonization of the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">In Histophilus somni , <scope type="spec" id="5"> the FhaB homolog is <cue type="spec" id="5">thought</cue> to also have an important role in biofilm formation in cases of myocarditis caused by this micro-organism [ 75 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Up-regulation of the A. pleuropneumoniae fhaB homolog during the acute phase of the disease hints at a similar role for this adhesin in the establishment of pleuropneumonia .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Surprisingly , <scope type="neg" id="6">this gene was <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> identified as up-regulated in previous adhesion experiments performed in our lab [ 9 ] , and it even showed a slight , although not significant</scope> , down-regulation when A. pleuropneumoniae adhered to immortalized lung epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">This can either reflect differences in regulatory events between a freshly isolated field strain and a well-conserved and characterized laboratory strain , or simply that in vitro experiments , however carefully designed they <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be</scope> , can never really completely reproduce complex in vivo environments .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Despite years of research , an efficient cross-serotype vaccine that can prevent porcine pleuropneumonia has yet to be successfully produced .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">To generate a vaccine that provides good cross-serotype protection against porcine pleuropneumonia , one <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">would</cue> most <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">probably</cue> have to include antigens that are conserved amongst all serotypes that the host <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">could</cue> encounter and be surface-exposed</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">The three proteins that are encoded by genes fhaB , irp and APL_0920 have all these features , and <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">might</cue> therefore represent good candidates to include in future cross-serotype vaccines against A. pleuropneumoniae</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">FHA of B. pertussis is present in various combined diphteria-tetanus-pertussis ( dTpa ) acellular vaccines .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">These vaccines have been successfully used to prevent whopping cough and have contributed to a considerable decrease in the number of cases registered per year [ 76 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Thus the A. pleuropneumonie FhaB homolog represents an excellent candidate to include in a future pleuropneumonia vaccine that <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">could</cue> actually lead to efficient protection against this important swine pathogen</scope> .</sentence>
