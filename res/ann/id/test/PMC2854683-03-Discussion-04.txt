The bigger picture: niche adaptation and the evolution of hypervirulence in S. pyogenes 
Having used multiple strategies and integrated the PM data with the in vitro and in vivo microarray data, we propose the following hypotheses about streptococcal niche adaptation and switch to hypervirulence: (1) Exposure to the in vivo environment perturbs a substantial number of GAS genes and regulatory networks. This has been demonstrated by the larger number of genes affected during in vivo adaptation of both M1T1 variants compared to those affected by the covS mutation (Table 2). However, many of the genes modulated in vivo seem to be involved in metabolic reprogramming and stress responses rather than pathoadaptation and virulence. This is why we believe that transcriptional reprogramming by environmental adaptation alone was insufficient to provide WT bacteria with an in vivo survival advantage. In fact, WT bacteria underwent the most dramatic in vivo transcriptional reprogramming (Table 2); yet, they failed to survive since after five to seven days post-infection, they became extinct, and only AP bacteria could be isolated from the mice chambers [16]. (2) The covS mutation in AP bacteria seems to be preferentially modulating virulence mechanisms, as about 25% of the known genes perturbed by the mutation belong to virulence subsystems (Fig. 5) and many of the other perturbed genes are indirectly associated with virulence (e.g., carbohydrate metabolism [66] and arginine utilization proteins [38]). In addition, the pathoadaptive clusters (CC4-CC10 in Fig. 2) are more enriched in virulence-related genes than the clusters involved in in vivo adaption (CC1-CC3 in Fig. 2). This finding suggests that AP bacteria are somehow "pre-adapted" to invasiveness and, consequently, when injected into mice, they do not undergo much virulence-related changes as they already possess a thicker capsule, lack a functional SpeB, are equipped with surface virulence proteins, and secrete ready-to-use toxins, including the potent DNase, Sda1. However, the degree of AP invasiveness might vary depending on the route of infection and animal model [15]. It is noteworthy that SpeB expression has a dominant effect, since even if secreted in low amounts by a minor subpopulation, this broad-spectrum protease would still be able to degrade, fully or partially, many GAS virulence proteins, including Sda1, thereby rendering the bacteria vulnerable to different effector mechanisms of the host's innate immune system including neutrophil killing [14], [67], [68]. Thus, a complete shutdown of proteolytically active SpeB is essential to preserve effective extracellular virulence factors [15]. This dominant SpeB effect may explain why WT bacteria parish in vivo even though they partially downregulate SpeB transcription (Table 3). (3) The GAS genome has at least 13 two-component regulatory systems [69] in addition to several stand-alone transcriptional regulators [47], [70]. However, the CovRS system is a major player, among these regulators, in driving the bacterial adaptation to the host's environment and regulating virulence directly or through other downstream regulators [20], [54]. It is thus counterintuitive that bacteria lacking the important environmental sensor, CovS, would prevail in one of the most stressful environments. However, losing this sensor might be the last resort for these bacteria stranded away from their primary niche and surrounded by hostile immune cells and proteins. From an evolutionary point of view, it is possible to speculate that the bacteria lose their danger sensor to keep their "weapons" constitutively expressed and fight to survive when escape is not an option. Such mutation is likely detrimental to the bacterial long-term survival and dissemination via colonization of new hosts [71], as they need a WT sensor for better adaptability [72] (e.g., in less hostile niches like throat or saliva [26]). An intact CovRS system would offer the bacteria enough versatility to turn on and off many regulatory networks through CovS signaling. This flexible mechanism allows the bacteria to initially hide from the immune system through SpeB-driven camouflaging, i.e. degradation of most of their immunogenic virulence factors [2], [3]. (4) We also show that the impact of the covS mutation goes beyond the defined CovR regulon. This finding is in accordance with previous observations that CovR and CovS are not committed to each other, as CovR could be phosphorylated in the absence of a functional CovS [22] and as different covS mutations, albeit clustered in the histidine kinase domain, might have different transcriptional effects [27], including opposite effects on different members of the CovR regulon [26].
