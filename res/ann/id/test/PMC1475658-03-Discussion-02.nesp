<sentence id="0">AprA Protects P. entomophila from Antibacterial Peptides</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In bacteria , nitrogen and carbon sources are frequently provided by enzymatic degradation of extracellular biopolymers by proteases and glycosidases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Proteases , especially metalloproteases , are also known to contribute to virulence in some pathogenic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , S. marcescens , and Bacillus thuringiensis [ 20,21,26 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis attributed to these proteases include degradation of structural matrices and destruction of proteins involved in host protective functions such as AMPs or complement factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , in most cases , attempts to evaluate the role of metalloproteases in virulence have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to obtain conclusive results with respect to a specific function</scope> [ 20,21 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , our approach focusing on both host and pathogen is the first to clearly demonstrate a key role of the AprA metalloprotease in the protection against AMPs in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This conclusion is based on our observations that ( i ) aprA mutants show attenuated virulence , ( ii ) aprA mutants survive less well than wild-type P. entomophila in Drosophila and are more sensitive to Imd-mediated defense , and ( iii ) AprA provides specific protection in vivo against Diptericin .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Altogether , our study reveals that local AMP expression plays an important role in defense against oral pathogens and that entomopathogens such as P. entomophila can counteract this effect by expressing aprA .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It is interesting to note that S. marcescens , another potent oral pathogen of Drosophila , also expresses a protease that can degrade AMPs in vitro [ 12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , in the absence of a Serratia protease mutant , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the in vivo relevance of the protease is <cue type="spec" id="1">not</cue> yet established</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Taken together , this observation and our findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that proteases <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> represent a common strategy used by Drosophila pathogens to circumvent the potent antimicrobial host defense</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We cannot exclude that AprA degrades other immune effectors or participates directly as a toxic factor by degrading the gut epithelium or the peritrophic matrix .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In B. thuringiensis , it has been proposed that the protease InhA2 participates in the degradation of the gut , thus facilitating the action of the Cry toxins [ 27,28 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Alternatively , in Photorhabdus luminescens , an AprA homologue , PrtA , has been <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">proposed</cue> not to be a virulence factor</scope> , but rather to be involved in degrading host tissues following host death in order to promote efficient nutrition and development of its symbiotic nematode host [ 14,29 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The observation that injection of AprA into the hemocoel is lethal to adult flies supports the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">hypothesis</cue> of additional roles for the protease in bacterial pathogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">However , oral ingestion of purified AprA induces only low levels of lethality , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicating that</cue> AprA alone is <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> sufficient to kill the host via this route of entry</scope> , and other factors participate in oral toxicity</scope> .</sentence>
