<sentence id="0">Involvement of Type 1 Fimbriae in Swimming Motility</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The abundance of fimE and fimB mutants in the enrichment for nonmotile mutants <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> a role for type 1 fimbriae in swimming motility</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These genes encode site-specific recombinases that catalyze the inversion of a DNA element known as the fim switch or fimS , whose orientation controls the expression of fimbrial structural genes [ 60 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Inversion of fimS by site-specific recombinases alternately connects and disconnects the fimbrial structural genes from their promoter , resulting in a process of phase variation that gives rise to bacteria in either the fimbriate ( phase ON ) or afimbriate ( phase OFF ) state [ 61 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By randomly sampling mutants impaired for motility and sequencing the region of DNA adjacent to the transposon , we identified a mutant with a reduced ability to swim with an insertion within fimS .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To determine the nature of the motility defect , we analyzed the fimS mutant by transmission electron microscopy .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The fimS mutant exhibited a level of fimbriation similar to fimB-fimE- double mutants locked in phase ON ( Figure S11A ) , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> a high level of fimbriation reduces motility in semi-solid agar</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This observation is confirmed by comparing the motility of the fimS mutant to phase ON fimB-fimE- double mutants ( Figure S11B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We found that swarming was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> impaired in either the fimS mutant or the mutants with fimbria locked in phase ON</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> fimbria expression does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> interfere with swarming motility ( Figure S11C )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="5"> The basis for motility suppression by constitutive fimbriae expression remains <cue type="spec" id="5">unclear</cue> ; however</scope> , we observed that hyper-fimbriated cells tend to have , on average , fewer flagella compared to their afimbriated counterparts ( Figure S11D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> reflect competing demands for resources and/or surface area for synthesis and assembly of these extracellular appendages</scope> .</sentence>
