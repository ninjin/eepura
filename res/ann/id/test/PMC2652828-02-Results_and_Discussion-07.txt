Proteins co-regulated by Hfq and SmpB 
We were interested in determining whether there was overlap in translational regulation between Hfq and SmpB i.e., the extent of cross-talk or level of co-ordination if any between these two translational regulators (Table S1). For example it was possible that Hfq directly modulates translation of smpB and therefore all of the effects observed for smpB could be related to Hfq. For logarithmic phase growth conditions, the expression pattern of 242 proteins appeared to exhibit a dependence on Hfq, while 37 proteins exhibited a dependency on SmpB. Twenty proteins overlapped both sets, including the motility proteins FliC, CheA, CheZ and Tsr. Under stationary phase growth conditions 270 proteins appeared to be under control of Hfq and 27 proteins under control of SmpB. Nine proteins, including the NADPH-dependent quinine oxidoreductase Qor, TolC involved in LPS biosynthesis, and a putative hydrolase YbeM, overlapped. Of the 390 proteins regulated by Hfq and 50 proteins regulated by SmpB in growth in AMM-2, 15 proteins were co-regulated by both Hfq and SmpB, including the invasion protein PrgI, MdoH involved in the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharide, and a putative periplasmic protein CreA. Under growth in AMM-1 267 proteins appeared regulated by Hfq and the expression pattern of 86 proteins exhibited a dependence on SmpB. Twenty four of these proteins were co-regulated by both Hfq and SmpB. This subset included a putative serine/threonine protein kinase, a putative intracellular proteinase YhbO, SrfJ, a known Salmonella Typhimurium virulence protein, and the stress protein HtpG. These results also confirm that there is no direct translational control of smpB by Hfq.
