A 14.8 kb region inserted in the 23.9 kb region containing fsrA and fsrB 
Nakayama et al. [29] described a conserved 23.9 kb chromosomal deletion when comparing fsrA-lacking/fsrC+/gelE+ strains (by PCR) from various origins with V583; the deleted sequences start in the middle of EF1841, include the fsrAB genes and end in the middle of the fsrC gene (EF1820). Loss of the fsr regulatory components results in a gelatinase-negative phenotype under routine test conditions despite the fact that these strains still carry the gelE gene [23,29]. The absence/presence of the 23.9 kb region, from EF1820/fsrC to EF1841, did not appear to correlate with the clinical origin of the isolates [30]. In a more recent analysis of relationships between various E. faecalis strains, the 23.9 kb region was not detected in 86% of the strains of the clonal complex (CC)2, 58% of the CC9 strains, nor in any of the CC8 strains [31]. The Symbioflor 1 strain, used as a probiotic, is one representative of the 7.4% of E. faecalis isolates that are missing the gelE gene in addition to the 23.9 kb region [5,30]. Our analysis of this area in OG1RF revealed the presence of an additional 14.8 kb fragment inserted between the corresponding EF1826 and EF1827 of OG1RF (confirmed by PCR; results not shown). In OG1RF, this 14.8 kb region contains two loci, a WxL locus (described below) and a seven-gene locus that may encode a possible ABC transporter with similarity to one annotated in Pediococcus pentosaceus.
