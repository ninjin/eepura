<sentence id="0">AprA Confers Protection against the Imd-Dependent Immune Response</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Virulence factors allow pathogens to survive in the hostile environment of the host , to escape the immune system , or to establish a biotope where they can proliferate by altering host functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The observation that P. entomophila persistence in flies and larvae is lower in aprA mutants clearly <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> the AprA protease promotes bacterial persistence in the Drosophila gut</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our previous study had already revealed that the humoral arm of the Drosophila immune response mediated by the Imd pathway contributes to resistance against orally transmitted P. entomophila , since flies mutated in the Relish ( Rel ) gene showed a consistently increased mortality rate [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> AprA plays a role in counteracting the Imd-dependent immune response</scope> , we compared persistence of wild-type P. entomophila , gacA , and aprA derivatives by quantifying the number of bacteria in Rel flies and larvae .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Whereas the titer of gacA mutants decreased with time , we observed that the aprA derivative persisted at a level similar to wild-type bacteria in Rel-deficient mutant flies and larvae ( Figure 3A and 3B , and unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The observation that AprA was required to promote persistence in wild-type flies and larvae but was dispensable in a Rel background , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates that</cue> AprA plays an important role in the protection against the Imd-dependent immune response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To investigate the connection between activation of the Imd pathway and the outcome of P. entomophila infection in more detail , we focused our analysis on the adult stage when it is easier to monitor survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">P. entomophila infection triggers Imd pathway activation within hours .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">To determine at which time Imd was required to impede P. entomophila infection , we monitored survival to P. entomophila in flies in which the Imd pathway was artificially activated in a time-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We utilized an engineered fly line ( UAS-imd , hs-Gal4 ) over-expressing imd under the control of a heat-shock promoter via the UAS-Gal4 system , which consequently leads to strong expression of Imd-dependent AMP genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Figure 4A shows that over-expressing imd 12 h prior to infection protected flies from a P. entomophila infection , whereas over-expressing imd 6 h before contributed only modestly to survival of the flies .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This experiment <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicates that</cue> P. entomophila can be eliminated when the Imd pathway is activated at a high level prior to infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">It further <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> that P. entomophila is sensitive to immune defenses during a short time frame and subsequently becomes insensitive</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Since P. entomophila is pathogenic under normal wild-type conditions , it <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> overcome the immune response by establishing a niche in the gut before the Imd pathway is activated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">It is interesting to note that in agreement with the results described above , persistence of both the aprA mutant and wild-type bacteria was significantly altered in fly lines over-expressing the Imd pathway , and that aprA mutants survived less than wild-type bacteria ( Figure 4B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Altogether , these data reveal that the Imd pathway is crucial for host survival after oral infection with P. entomophila and that AprA plays a key role in counteracting this effect .</sentence>
