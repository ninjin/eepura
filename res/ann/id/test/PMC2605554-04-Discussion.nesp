<sentence id="11">Recently , we have demonstrated that WT , SpeB-positive bacteria undergo a phase-shift to a SpeB-negative phenotype after subcutaneous infection of mice [ 17 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="15">It is the loss of SpeB expression in these mutant bacteria <scope type="spec" id="5"> that is <cue type="spec" id="5">hypothesized</cue> to allow the invasive spread of GAS by sparing from SpeB degradation self-proteins involved in plasminogen accumulation and activation [ 42 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In this study we found that SpeB-positive bacteria with a restored RopB reverted to a SpeB-negative phenotype on subcutaneous infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Furthermore , <scope type="spec" id="6"> the switch to a SpeB-negative phenotype <cue type="spec" id="6">appeared</cue> to occur exclusively through mutations in covR/S</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">This result <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggests</cue> that covR/S mutations are the predominant method of phenotypic switching in GAS and that ropB mutation is <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> readily selected for in vivo</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">This leads to the conclusion that ropB mutation in 5628 does <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> represent a similar mechanism to covR/S mutation</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> ( a ) be an incidental occurrence or ( b ) arise secondary to different selection pressures than those associated with the shift to invasive infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Microarray analysis was conducted using in vivo-derived RNA , since the transcriptome of bacteria grown in vitro <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">may</cue> differ greatly from the transcriptome found during the course of infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Implantation of tissue cages allows for bacteria to be grown in an in vivo environment for 24 hours prior to recovery and RNA extraction .</sentence>

<sentence id="25">The clinical isolate 5628 expressing a truncated RopB , as well as the allelic exchange mutant 5448R- also expressing the truncated RopB from 5628 , showed reduced virulence compared to strains containing a full-length RopB .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">These data illustrate the necessity for an intact RopB for full virulence in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">In addition , the strain 5628RDeltaSpeB expressing an intact RopB but lacking SpeB showed similarly reduced virulence to the strain with a truncated RopB .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">While the down-regulation of the streptolysin S operon <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">may</cue> contribute to the reduced virulence</scope> , this finding <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">implies</cue> that the loss of SpeB in this strain is the main cause of the lack of virulence exhibited</scope> .</sentence>
