Introduction 
Host-pathogen interactions are complex relationships in which the success of each organism depends on its ability to overcome the other. Consequently, hosts have evolved surveillance and defense mechanisms to detect and eliminate invading microorganisms, whereas pathogens use sophisticated strategies to counteract such responses. In recent years, Drosophila has emerged as a powerful model for the study of host-pathogen interactions [1,2]. An attractive feature of the Drosophila system is the existence of multiple defense reactions that are shared with higher organisms [3-5]. These strategies include physical barriers, together with the local and systemic immune responses. Several tissues participate in a coordinated defense against microbial infection. Firstly, epithelia, such as alimentary tract and tracheae, are the first line of defense against pathogens and produce both antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and reactive oxygen species. Secondly, specialized hemocytes participate in phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign intruders. Finally, the fat body, a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver, is the site of the humoral response. Several genetic studies have demonstrated the regulation of AMP synthesis by the Toll and immune-deficient (Imd) pathways. The Toll pathway is mainly activated by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, and controls, to a large extent, the expression of AMPs (e.g., Drosomycin) through the nuclear factor-kappaB transactivators Dif and Dorsal. In contrast, the Imd pathway mainly responds to Gram-negative bacterial infections and controls different AMP genes (e.g., Diptericin) via the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB transactivator Relish (Rel) [3,4,6]. In addition, the Imd pathway plays a predominant role in the regulation of AMPs in the alimentary tract and tracheal epithelia [7]. Our knowledge of the Drosophila immune response is mainly based on the analysis of host reactions following direct injection of non-pathogenic bacteria into the insect hemocoel. One limitation associated with this approach is that it bypasses the initial steps of naturally occurring infections, including bacterial colonization and persistence and host local immune responses. Septic injury is probably of little consequence in nature, unlike oral infection upon ingestion. In addition, the response to non-pathogenic microorganisms does not necessarily reflect a natural host reaction to a real pathogen. Recently we have developed the use of natural oral infection to dissect host responses of Drosophila after challenge with bacteria demonstrated to be infectious for this insect. We have isolated several Erwinia carotovora strains, such as Ecc15, for their capacity to persist in the Drosophila larval gut and to trigger a strong systemic immune response following oral infection [8]. Although not a pathogen to Drosophila, use of Ecc15 has been pivotal in revealing the ability of Drosophila to activate an adapted response to persistent microorganisms in the gut, including the induction of local immune responses. More recently, we isolated Pseudomonas entomophila, a Gram-negative natural bacterial pathogen of Drosophila, from flies in Guadeloupe [9]. We demonstrated that P. entomophila induces both systemic and local immune responses in Drosophila and causes a food-uptake cessation following oral infection in larvae. Importantly, in contrast to Ecc15, P. entomophila is highly pathogenic for Drosophila as well as for species from a different insect order (Lepidoptera). The genome sequence of P. entomophila has been completed and reveals the existence of a large set of genes encoding putative virulence factors such as proteases, lipases, toxins, alginate synthesis, and adhesion factors [10]. Transposon mutagenesis of P. entomophila allowed us to identify several regulatory genes required to infect or to kill Drosophila. Among them we identified the GacS/GacA two-component regulatory system which, in Pseudomonas fluorescens, has been well characterized and demonstrated to be an essential regulator of virulence [11]. P. entomophila gacA mutants are non-pathogenic and fail to trigger a systemic immune response after ingestion, indicating that the GacS/GacA two-component system regulates important bacterial virulence effectors required to infect and kill flies [9]. Despite these studies, little is known about the mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens to interfere with the corresponding insect host defenses. Here we report an in vivo analysis of P. entomophila virulence to both Drosophila larvae and adult flies following natural oral infection. We present in vivo evidence for a direct role in pathogenesis of the secreted P. entomophila zinc metalloprotease, AprA, which counteracts AMPs synthesized by the host. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Drosophila Imd-regulated local gut response is necessary to combat infection and that P. entomophila AprA-regulation via GacS/GacA and PrtR regulators is used as a strategy to escape AMP activity. This study also highlights the importance of the gut immune response in the control of food-borne pathogens.
