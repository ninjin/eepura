<sentence id="0">A homologue of Tn916 in OG1RF</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An analysis of the G+C content of OG1RF unique regions revealed several loci with a lower G+C content than the 37.8 % average content of OG1RF .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One of these is an approximately 49 kb fragment with a G+C content of 32.1 % located between an rRNA operon and the homologue in OG1RF of EF1053 , replacing 10 tRNA genes present in V583 ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> This fragment <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be a patchwork composed of hypothetical genes , homologues of Tn916-associated genes and homologues of genes from other Gram-positive organisms , including Listeria , E. faecium , staphylococci , or lactococci ( Additional data file 1 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It is interesting to note that this region contains : a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> adhesin protein gene ( OG1RF_0039 ) at one end of the fragment</scope> ; homologues of 14 Tn916-associated genes ( Tn916_2 to Tn916_12 , Tn916_18 and Tn916_19 , with an average of 70 % similarity ) ; and a gene encoding a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> integrase ( OG1RF_0088</scope> ) at the other end - these three features are also present in Tn5386 in E. faecium D344R [ 46 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the approximately 49 kb fragment <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lacks</cue> an excisase gene and the <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">probable</cue> lantibiotic ABC transporter genes present in Tn5386</scope></scope> .</sentence>
