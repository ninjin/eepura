<sentence id="0">LPS and OPG Mutations Impair Motility by Repressing Flagellar Gene Expression through the Rcs Signaling Pathway</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The widespread influence of LPS and OPG mutations on swimming , swarming , and chi-phage infection prompted us to explore the genetic mechanism of these mutations in more detail .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [ 34,35 ] , and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [ 36 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The Rcs pathway consists of a phosphotransfer protein ( RcsD ) that mediates phosphate transfer from a sensor kinase ( RcsC ) to a response regulator ( RcsB ) that binds DNA with an accessory protein ( RcsA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Phosphorylated RcsB is known to bind upstream of the flhDC operon and to repress its expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The pathway also includes a recently identified outer membrane lipoprotein ( RcsF ) that is known to activate the Rcs system [ 37 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To determine the role of the Rcs signaling pathway in LPS/OPG mediated repression of motility , we disrupted each of the components of the Rcs system in most of our LPS and OPG mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We found that deletion of rcsB , rcsD , or rcsF was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants ( Figure S6 ) , providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Deletion of rcsC rescued motility to a lesser extent .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This observation is consistent with the dual functional role of RcsC as both kinase and phosphatase , moving phosphates both to and away from RcsB via RcsD , and that RcsB remains phosphorylated in rcsC null mutants [ 38,39 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Therefore , while rcsC mutations disrupt the RcsF-->RcsC-->RcsD-->RcsB phosphorelay cascade , the phosphorylation of RcsB cannot be fully reversed in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of RcsC phosphatase activity</scope> , as observed by the reduced flhDC-lacZ expression and motility exhibited by rcsC and rcsD mutants ( Figure 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This conclusion is further supported by the dramatic reduction in swimming motility by rcsC137 mutants ( Figure S7 ) , in which the rcsC137 gene product has lost its phosphatase activity [ 40 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The chi-phage selection results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that LPS and OPG are necessary for infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">However , since functional flagella are a prerequisite for chi-phage infection , we sought to determine <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> defects in LPS and OPG affect chi-phage infection directly <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">or</cue> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">whether</scope></cue> the observed selection results are primarily due to reduced flagellar expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">To evaluate the necessity of LPS and OPG for phage infection , we needed mutants that were defective in these structures but still synthesized functional flagella and were motile .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Therefore , we created double mutants combining an LPS or OPG mutation and a secondary mutation in one of the components of the Rcs signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">These mutants were used in an infectivity assay in which plaque-forming units ( PFUs ) are monitored over time to assess sensitivity to phage infection [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">An flhD mutant was used as a chi-phage-resistant control and , as expected , showed <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> sensitivity</scope> , whereas chi-phage multiplied rapidly in the presence of the wild-type strain ( Figure 5A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Both OPG and LPS mutants showed decreased sensitivity to chi-phage , and the decrease in sensitivity was eliminated by introducing DeltarcsF deletions , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicating that</cue> OPG and LPS are <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> directly required for chi-phage infection ( Figures 5B-D )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">We also observed that sensitivity to chi-phage was higher in rfaI mutants than rfaC mutants , <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">indicating that</cue> chi-phage infectivity is directly related to the degree of flhDC expression ( Figures 4 , 5B , and 5C )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">In a previous study , the swarming deficiency of LPS mutants had <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggested</cue> an essential role for LPS in swarming behavior [ 41</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">To test <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">whether</cue> such a direct role exists</scope> , we interrogated our collection of LPS and OPG mutants for swarming proficiency .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing DeltarcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype ( Figures 3F and S6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">These data <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">indicate that</cue> LPS and OPG are <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">not</cue> directly necessary for swarming</scope> , and that the behavior exhibited by such mutants results from Rcs-mediated repression of the flhDC operon</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">A model summarizing the involvement of Rcs signaling on swimming , swarming , and chi-phage infection is shown in Figure 3G .</sentence>
