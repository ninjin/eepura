Effect of insertional inactivation on expression of beta-antigen 
Several approaches were used to prepare the cell lysates of the wild-type strain 168/00 and mutant strains. As result, 10 min boiling of the cells in 2-mercaptoethanol (10%, w/w) was found to be most effective with respect to higher yield and quality of the protein bands observed after SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Subsequently, bacterial cell lysates and secreted proteins after 2 hrs and 5 hrs of growth in THB were analyzed. SDS-PAGE of secreted proteins did not reveal any difference among the wild-type strain and mutant strains (data not shown). However, SDS-PAGE of the cell lysates revealed that at least one protein band of approximately140 kDa was present in the wild-type strain 168/00 and sak188 mutant strain, and was absent in sak189/sak188 double mutant strain. Western-blotting with labeled human IgA identified this protein as beta-antigen (Fig. 3).
