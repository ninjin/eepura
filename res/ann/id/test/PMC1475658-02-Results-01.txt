P. entomophila Secretes an Abundant Protease A common strategy used by bacterial pathogens is to secrete toxins and other virulence factors that damage host tissues. To test whether P. entomophila could secrete such toxic factors, a supernatant filtrate from a bacterial culture was tested for its ability to kill Drosophila. Figure 1A shows that a concentrated P. entomophila culture filtrate had a moderate but significant effect on Drosophila larvae survival following ingestion. Although the filtrate did not kill adult flies after feeding (unpublished data), it was highly toxic by direct injection into the hemocoel (Figure 1B). No killing of either larvae or adults was observed with a culture filtrate derived from the avirulent P. entomophila strain carrying a Tn5 transposon in the gacA gene [9]. These data suggested that P. entomophila secreted one or more factors with toxic activity under the control of the GacS/GacA two-component system. In an attempt to identify the factor(s) responsible for toxicity, we analyzed the proteins present in the supernatant. The protein profile for wild-type P. entomophila supernantant (Figure 1C, lane 2) shows a major protein band at 51 kDa and several minor bands. MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic fragments of the 51-kDa band identified this protein as a homolog of the previously characterized Apr proteases from Pseudomonas spp., Prt proteases from Erwinia spp. and Photorhabdus spp., and serralysins from Serratia spp. [12-14]. All of these proteases are members of the zinc metzincin family of Type I-secreted RTX proteins [15]. We subsequently purified this protease, termed AprA, to homogeneity from the P. entomophila supernatant by anion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (Figure 1D). Injection of pure AprA into the hemocoel rapidly killed adult flies, identifying this protein as a bacterial toxin (Figure 1E). Feeding of larvae with high concentrations (1.5 mg/ml) of AprA led to modest lethality (unpublished data), recapitulating the properties of the P. entomophila supernatant. Interestingly, in a gacA mutant the number of proteins in the supernatant was greatly reduced, including the complete absence of the 51-kDa band corresponding to AprA (Figure 1C, lane 3). In P. fluorescens, membrane-localized anti-sigma factor PrtR cleaves the extracytoplasmic sigma factor PrtI, resulting in increased expression of multiple genes, including one encoding for a metalloprotease, aprX [16]. Two independent Tn5 insertions in the prtR gene affecting virulence have recently been identified in a random insertional mutagenesis screen of P. entomophila [10]. To test a possible role of prtR in the regulation of aprA expression, we analyzed the proteins present in the supernatant of prtR mutants. Interestingly, both prtR mutants (CL25 and CU1) displayed a secreted protein profile identical to the wild-type strain except for a marked decrease of AprA (Figure 1C, lanes 4 and 5). Measurement of in vitro protease activity with azocasein revealed that the gacA mutant secretes no detectable protease activity and that prtR mutants retain only 30% of wild-type supernatant activity, thus indicating a role for PrtR in the regulation of P. entomophila protease secretion (Figure 1F). Furthermore, the prtR supernatant showed no toxicity toward flies after injection, suggesting a correlation between AprA levels and virulence (unpublished data). Altogether, this analysis indicates that P. entomophila gacA and prtR genes regulate the secretion of a protease with toxic activity when injected into flies or fed to larvae.
