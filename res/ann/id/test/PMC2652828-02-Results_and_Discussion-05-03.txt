Stress response 
Hfq was observed to modulate numerous proteins involved in envelope stress under AMM-2 conditions, including FkpA, SurA, HtrA, NlpB, NmpC, ClpA, SlyD, RseA, RseB, RpoE, OmpF, and HtpG, which were all up-regulated in the Deltahfq mutant strain. These observations are in agreement with the recently suggested role of Hfq in envelope stress based on lacZ translational fusions [34] as well as the observation that rpoE is translationally regulated by Hfq [10]. Proteins involved in oxidative stress (NarY, Qor, Dps, WraB, OxyR, GrxA, Gor, GrxB, KatG, KatE, SodC, SodB, AhpF); acid stress (CadA); and starvation (SspA, SspB) were all also differentially regulated by Hfq (Table S1). Collectively, these results point to a central role for Hfq in regulating stress response in Salmonella Typhimurium. Many of these genes are required for virulence as discussed in more detail below. For example rpoE has been shown to be required for the virulence of Salmonella Typhimurium [35]. Two RpoE-regulated genes, htrA and surA, have also been shown to be involved in Salmonella virulence [35], [36], [37]. The OxyR-regulated gene dps was demonstrated to contribute to Salmonella oxidative stress resistance, survival in macrophages, and virulence in mice [38]. Recent studies have shown the periplasmic Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase sodC to contribute to Salmonella virulence in mice [39], [40].
