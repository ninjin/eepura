Genes involved in regulatory networks 
Facing stimuli, different regulatory genes were upregulated in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, reflecting their unique ability to respond to environmental challenges. phoP and cpxR genes identified from P. temperata, encode response regulators in two-component regulatory systems PhoPQ and CpxRA, respectively [23,24]. PhoP and CpxR are dual transcriptional regulators that are activated in response to environmental stimuli and then act to modulate activity of other genes [23,24]. Responding to low Mg2+ levels, phoP expression is auto-regulated by PhoP and PhoQ proteins and phoQ is constitutive [25]. Auto-regulation of phoP likely regulates expression of other genes that mediate various cellular functions such as LPS modification, cell structure [26], and type III secretion systems [27]. phoP has been previously identified to be involved in virulence as mutational inactivation of this gene rendered P. luminescens avirulent to Spodoptera littoralis larvae [6]. Similarly, the regulatory protein CpxR can be activated in response to signals associated with growth and metabolic pathways [28]. By sensing cell envelope stress CpxR appears to control expression of other genes involved in envelope stress response, secretion, motility and multidrug resistance [29]. Sometimes, CpxR acts to modulate other transcriptional factors [30]. Although there is no evidence showing links between phoP/cpxR and other isolated genes, overexpression of these two response regulator genes may possibly relate to genes involved in stress responses (gshB, gor, msrA and surA), cell structure (skp, dacC and ompF) and type III secretion systems (sctL) identified in this study. Further, in P. temperata, lysR gene encoding a transcriptional activator protein was found to be upregulated during infection of R. majalis, while two genes yijC and rseA encoding transcriptional repressors were identified in X. koppenhoeferi. The pathway network analysis indicates that the product of yijC may function as a repressor to potentially control the expression of the fabB gene, which in turn, modulates the physical properties of the membrane by altering the level of unsaturated fatty acid production. Besides transcriptional regulatory genes, gene tilS, encoding a putative cell cycle protein [4], was induced in X. koppenhoeferi. Upregulation of distinct regulatory genes in these two bacteria indicates the different stress response mechanisms between the bacterial species in the same host. However, none of these regulatory factors were identified in P. luminescens exposed to G. mellonella homogenate in a previous study [16], suggesting that regulation of these factors either depends on host (R. majalis not G. mellonella) or bacteria themselves.
