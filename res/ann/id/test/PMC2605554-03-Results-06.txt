RopB is required for virulence in systemic infection 
To determine the effect of ropB mutation on virulence, C57BL6/J mice were subjected to intraperitoneal infection with mid-logarithmic phase bacteria. GAS strain 5628R+ expressing a full length RopB showed increased virulence compared to the strain 5628 with a truncated RopB (Figure 4A). Strain 5628RDeltaSpeB containing a full-length RopB but lacking SpeB also showed reduced virulence, suggesting that the reduced virulence of 5628 may primarily result from the lack of SpeB expression in this strain. Virulence was also examined in an intravenous model of systemic infection. The well characterized strain 5448 and its isogenic mutant 5448R-, containing the ropB allele from 5628, were further included to examine the effect of this allelic variation in a well-characterized virulent strain of GAS. The two strains containing a truncated RopB (5628 and 5448R-) demonstrated similarly reduced virulence compared to the two strains containing a full-length RopB (5628R+ and 5448) (Fig. 4B), confirming that inactivation of RopB results in decreased virulence in systemic infection.
