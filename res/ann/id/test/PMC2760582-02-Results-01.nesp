<sentence id="1">Isolation of bacterial transcripts induced in Rhizotrogus majalis To isolate bacterial genes induced upon infection , total RNA was isolated from live grubs at 24 h post injection with P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi , as well as from 48 h log-phase bacterial cultures grown in Brain Heart Infusion ( BHI ) broth that were used to inject R. majalis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Random-primed bacterial cDNAs were normalized by hybridization to biotinylated bacterial genomic DNA that had been blocked beforehand using bacterial ribosomal RNA operon , resulting in sampling of bacterial mRNA transcripts apart from its ribosomal and insect transcripts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The normalized bacterial cDNAs representing total mRNA transcripts produced by bacteria grown in vitro or within the infected insects were named as normalized in vitro and in vivo cDNA libraries , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To isolate bacterial mRNA transcripts preferentially induced during infection of the insect compared to the culture , normalized in vivo cDNAs were enriched by hybridization to biotinylated bacterial genomic DNA that had been pre-hybridized with rRNA operon and in vitro normalized cDNAs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The enriched cDNAs representing in vivo-induced genes , which were either lower in abundance or absent in 48 h in vitro bacterial cultures were then cloned into a TA cloning vector to construct in vivo enriched cDNA libraries .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A total of 384 clones ( 192 for each bacterium ) derived from enriched cDNA libraries were randomly picked for screening .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Out of these , the clones ( 150 for P. temperata and 140 for X. koppenhoeferi ) that showed stronger signal upon hybridization with in vivo-derived cDNAs compared to in vitro-derived cDNAs ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">1 ) were sequenced and analyzed using the non-redundant algorithms of BLAST in NCBI and database of Xenorhabdus Genomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These sequenced clones were therefore considered to represent reliable transcripts specifically expressed in P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi after 24 h infection of R. majalis .</sentence>
