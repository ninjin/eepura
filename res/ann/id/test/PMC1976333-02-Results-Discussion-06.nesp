<sentence id="0">Novel Genes Implicated in Swimming , Swarming , and chi-Phage Infection</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Application of microarray-based genetic footprinting to swimming , swarming , and chi-phage selection was effective in identifying nearly all known flagellar and chemotaxis genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Remarkably , the selection results guided the identification of three dozen additional genes that affect motility , most of which have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> previous evidence of involvement in motility ( Table S1</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Most of these non-flagellar genes encode components of the cell envelope .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For example , of the 20 non-flagellar genes revealed to affect swimming motility , twelve encode constituents of the inner membrane and periplasmic space .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These gene products include transport proteins ( SdaC , TatA , TatB , TatC , and WzxE ) , enzymes ( DsbA and Prc ) , periplasmic glucan synthesis proteins ( MdoG and MdoH ) , members of a signaling pathway ( RcsC and RcsD ) , and a predicted inner membrane protein of <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue> function ( YrfF</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Of these , only the genes encoding RcsD and glucan synthesis proteins had been previously implicated in swimming motility [ 32,33 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , we identified several genes that encode cytoplasmic components and other genes of <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">unknown</cue> function</scope> , including fimE , hycG , intG , rep , ulaE , and yhjH .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We systematically tested all newly identified swimming mutants for surface motility , and found that deletions of dsbA , intG , prc , rcsC , rep , tatB , tatC , wzxE , and yrfF strongly impair swarming .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Surprisingly , while mutants with deletions of rcsD , sdaC , tatA , and yhjH were impaired in swimming , these mutants swarmed normally ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Interrogation of genes with high z-scores in the enrichment for mutants incapable of swarming identified two additional genes that impact surface motility : hns , encoding a global transcriptional regulator , and yfiR , encoding a predicted periplasmic protein of <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">unknown</cue> function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In-frame deletions of these genes abolished swarming ; however , while the Deltahns mutant showed a severe swimming defect , the swimming motility of the DeltayfiR mutant was only mildly impaired ( Figures 3D and 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Among the loci exhibiting high z-scores after chi-phage selection were the rfa and mdo gene clusters responsible for the structural assembly of lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) and osmoregulated periplasmic glucans ( OPG ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Genes involved with the synthesis of LPS and OPG precursors ( hldD , hldE , galU , gmhA , gmhB , and pgm ) were also highly abundant after chi-phage selection .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">These findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggested</cue> that mutations in LPS and OPG biosynthetic genes <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> compromise motility</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">We confirmed this expectation by creating in-frame deletions of nearly all genes involved in LPS and OPG biosynthesis and assaying the mutants for motility .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">OPG mutants were defective in both swimming and swarming ; surprisingly , however , only mutants with large LPS truncations showed significant defects in these behaviors ( Figures 3E and 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">The wide functional repertoire of gene products found to affect motility prompted us to examine <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">whether</cue> genetic perturbations in these loci affect motility by signaling upstream of the regulatory circuit that controls flagellar biogenesis , resulting in repression of the flhDC flagellar master operon</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">To investigate this <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">possibility</cue> , we introduced flhDC-lacZ translational fusions in the deletion strains and performed beta-galactosidase assays</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Surprisingly , a large fraction of the mutants tested showed significant reduction in flhDC-lacZ expression values relative to the wild-type strain , demonstrating that the motility defects can be partly attributed to reduced expression of the flhDC operon .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">In addition , we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon , and the corresponding motility defect , were related to the degree of LPS truncation ( Figure 4 ) .</sentence>
