Discussion 
Group A streptococcal sociomicrobiology It is now well established that bacterial populations often consist of heterogeneous communities rather than genetically identical cells with synchronized gene expression profiles [49], [50], [51]. In this study, we show how gross changes in the bacterial environment, such as the onset of infection, can profoundly perturb the sociomicrobiological structure of the bacterial population, driving a minor subpopulation with a mutant hypervirulent phenotype to thrive, prevail, and cause severe disease. Although a number of informative studies have compared gene and protein expression in virulent and hypervirulent GAS isolates [11], [12], [13], [16], [26], [27], [37], none have captured the transitional state that reflects the dynamics of the bacterial struggle to survive in a new host environment. Normally, capturing such evolutionary events in real time is difficult, both because multiple sampling of the bacteria in vivo is often unfeasible due to their dissemination, and because the fittest members of the community usually overtake the rest of the population rather rapidly, thereby hampering the ability to capture dynamic changes associated with the restructuring of the bacterial community at different host niches. Our subcutaneous chamber model of infection allowed us to sample the inoculated WT and AP bacteria at specific times post-infection, during their adaptation to their new environment, to determine how their interaction with the host affects their community structure and their transcriptional reprogramming. In doing so, we were able to dissect changes in gene expression associated with niche adaptation from those resulting from restructuring of the bacterial community, where undetected minority members in vitro became the new majority in vivo, armed with the necessary tools to survive in their new niche. These in vivo-selected bacteria with the AP phenotype could be differentiated from the WT bacteria by mutations that are clustered in the sensor kinase-encoding covS gene in AP bacteria [14], [27]. In this study, we captured dynamic events underlying the phenotypic switch resulting from this population restructuring.
