<sentence id="0">Comparative genomic hybridizations</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CGH experiments conducted previously in our laboratory have shown that the majority of genes in the reference 5b L20 strain were conserved in reference strains and fresh field isolates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Conversely , 205 genes were identified as divergent in at least one strain , including 39 that are either phage or transposon related out of the 2033 ORFs represented on the microarray , which represents 10.1 % of divergent genes [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As anticipated , clusters of genes associated with LPS/capsule biosynthesis and toxin production showed variations .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">AppChip2 was designed using the complete genome sequence from the serotype 5b reference strain L20 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In order to validate its use to assess transcriptomic events taking place with our infectious field strain during the infection , we first used it to analyze the gene content of the 896-07 field strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The CGH data obtained with strain 896-07 was added to that obtained with other field and reference strains [ 25 ] in order to generate a strain dendogram ( Figure 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Serotyping data correlates well with genetic data since strain 896-07 forms a cluster with the serotype 5b reference strain L20 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The same clusters as those observed previously could be found in our dendrogram [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Only 28 genes were identified as divergent/absent in our field strain , when compared to the reference serotype 5b L20 strain ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This represents only 1.43 % of all the genes ( 1954 ) that are represented on AppChip2 [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Out of these 28 genes , 20 can be found in two major regions of the genome : 14 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> ORFs code for phage structures</scope> , while 6 are located in the A. pleuropneumoniae tight adherence ( tad ) locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , a close relative of A. pleuropneumoniae , the tad locus is involved in adherence to biological and abiological surfaces [ 26 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In A. pleuropneumoniae , genes from this locus were shown to be up-regulated during adhesion to lung epithelial cells in vitro [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The other important locus for gene divergence/absence was composed of phage-related features , and these were shown to be divergent during inter and intra-serotype comparisons in previous experiments [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Some genes <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> also be present in the genome of strain 896-07 and absent in reference strain L20</scope> , and therefore absent on AppChip2 .</sentence>
