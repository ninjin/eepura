Effect of insertional inactivation on transcription of bac gene 
In order to analyze if changes in beta-antigen expression are regulated at transcriptional level, the quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RNA samples isolated during the middle-exponential phase corresponding to 2 hrs of growth. As result, transcription of bac gene in sak189/sak188 double mutant strain was 17-fold less than in 168/00 wild-type strain (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the bac gene transcription level in sak188 mutant strain was almost similar to that in the wild-type strain that confirmed the results of SDS-PAGE and western-blotting. Thus, these data demonstrate that Sak189 protein regulates expression of beta-antigen at transcriptional level.
