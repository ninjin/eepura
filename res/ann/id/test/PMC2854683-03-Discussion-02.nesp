<sentence id="12">The downregulation of GRAB makes biological sense because this protein binds alpha-2-macroglobulin in blood [ 60 ] to protect the bacteria against its own protease , SpeB , and thus the bacteria <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no longer</cue> need to express high levels of GRAB when <scope type="neg" id="4">SpeB is <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> expressed</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Similarly , <scope type="spec" id="6"> EndoS , an IgG protease , and CAMP , a hemolysin , are <cue type="spec" id="6">likely</cue> needed in blood but with <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> defined function in subcutaneous or deep tissue</scope></scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="15">In addition , the downregulation of SpeB , EndoS , and CAMP is in agreement with our previous proteomic results [ 12 ] as well as other published transcriptional analyses [ 13 ] , [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">As both bacterial variants were subjected to the host environment , they underwent additional changes in gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In vivo , both WT and AP bacteria downregulated a substantial number of their genes ( 127 genes in CC1 and CC2 , Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">2 and Table S1 ) , and upregulated many fewer ( 24 genes in CC3 , Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">2 and Table S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">By parsing these differentially expressed genes into operons , subsystems , and functional pathways , we found that many reflect the engagement of several regulatory networks involved in metabolic adaptation and immune camouflage or evasion of host defenses .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Many of the in vivo changes that both the WT and AP bacteria underwent are <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggestive</cue> of major metabolic reprogramming associated with the transition from a saprophytic lifestyle in the carbohydrate-rich laboratory culture medium to a parasitic lifestyle in the vascularized and the anaerobic subcutaneous environments rich in peptides , amino acids , nucleotides , and different types of complex carbohydrates</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">For example , among the downregulated gene sets are those involved in citrate metabolism , arginine degradation , and de novo pyrimidine synthesis ; many of those gene sets were previously reported to be perturbed upon blood inoculation and to be controlled by CovR [ 61 ] and RopB/Rgg [ 38 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">We also found that many ribosomal and cell-division proteins were downregulated in vivo , which <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggests</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="10"> the cells <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> be slowing down protein synthesis to preserve energy , or redirect this energy to colonizing the host and evading its immune system</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">The downregulation of arginine deiminase , a streptococcal immunogen and a potential vaccine target ( Henningham et al. , submitted ) , is also <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">suggestive</cue> of immune evasion</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">Among the upregulated genes are dipepetide and sucrose-specific transporters , whose upregulation supports the <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">hypothesis</cue> that the bacteria are switching diets [ 39 ] and attempting to scavenge nutrients available in their new host environment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">Several phage genes are split between the upregulated and downregulated gene clusters ; this <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">indicate</cue> a stress-dependent reprogramming of prophage induction and gene expression that needs to be explored in future studies</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">Interestingly , what this study revealed is that some of the downstream regulatory effects of the covS mutation in AP bacteria are only manifested in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">For example , several gene sets ( e.g. , SLS genes , Trx-locus genes , L-ascorbate utilization genes ) were upregulated in WT bacteria in vivo , but were mostly silenced in AP bacteria in vivo ( Fig .</sentence>

<sentence id="30">On the other hand , genes encoding the fibrinolytic enzyme streptokinase , Ska , a RofA-like transcriptional regulator , several cell division proteins , and some phage proteins were only upregulated when the AP bacteria sensed the in vivo environment ( AP-vivo , Fig .</sentence>
