Isolation of bacterial transcripts induced in Rhizotrogus majalis To isolate bacterial genes induced upon infection, total RNA was isolated from live grubs at 24 h post injection with P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi, as well as from 48 h log-phase bacterial cultures grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth that were used to inject R. majalis. Random-primed bacterial cDNAs were normalized by hybridization to biotinylated bacterial genomic DNA that had been blocked beforehand using bacterial ribosomal RNA operon, resulting in sampling of bacterial mRNA transcripts apart from its ribosomal and insect transcripts. The normalized bacterial cDNAs representing total mRNA transcripts produced by bacteria grown in vitro or within the infected insects were named as normalized in vitro and in vivo cDNA libraries, respectively. To isolate bacterial mRNA transcripts preferentially induced during infection of the insect compared to the culture, normalized in vivo cDNAs were enriched by hybridization to biotinylated bacterial genomic DNA that had been pre-hybridized with rRNA operon and in vitro normalized cDNAs. The enriched cDNAs representing in vivo-induced genes, which were either lower in abundance or absent in 48 h in vitro bacterial cultures were then cloned into a TA cloning vector to construct in vivo enriched cDNA libraries. A total of 384 clones (192 for each bacterium) derived from enriched cDNA libraries were randomly picked for screening. Out of these, the clones (150 for P. temperata and 140 for X. koppenhoeferi) that showed stronger signal upon hybridization with in vivo-derived cDNAs compared to in vitro-derived cDNAs (Fig. 1) were sequenced and analyzed using the non-redundant algorithms of BLAST in NCBI and database of Xenorhabdus Genomes. These sequenced clones were therefore considered to represent reliable transcripts specifically expressed in P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi after 24 h infection of R. majalis.
