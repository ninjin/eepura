<sentence id="1">Transcriptional profiling of an ssrB mutant To begin to understand regulatory evolution and network expansion of the SsrB response regulator , we profiled the transcriptome of an ssrB mutant and compared it to S. Typhimurium wild-type cells grown in an acidic minimal medium that activates the SsrA-SsrB two-component regulatory system [ 20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We identified 133 genes that were significantly down-regulated in the ssrB mutant [ z < -1.96 ] [ 21 ] ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This included almost all genes in the SPI-2 genomic island as well as effector genes encoded throughout the genome ( Dataset S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Next , we performed a Clusters of Orthologous Groups ( COG ) analysis [ 22 ] on the 118 genes that had an ortholog in the annotated genome of S. Typhimurium strain LT2 [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Among these , 45 genes <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacked</cue> a functional COG assignment</scope> and the 73 remaining genes were distributed among 86 COGs ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The majority of functions in the latter groups are in transport , secretion , and trafficking of cellular components in addition to protein and membrane modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The SsrA-SsrB system was acquired by horizontal gene transfer into the S. enterica species after divergence from what is now extant S. bongori .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">As such , S. bongori has evolved in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of SsrA-SsrB</scope> and its regulatory architecture has <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> been influenced by it</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Orthologous genes ancestral to both species but regulated by SsrB in S. enterica provide evidence for network expansion and regulatory evolution that we previously showed can be mapped to a single cis-input location by using functional and comparative genomics [ 19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">To expand on this , we used a reciprocal BLAST-based analysis and identified 47 orthologs in S. bongori among the 133 genes whose transcription was down-regulated in an ssrB mutant ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In DeltassrB cells , the mean fold-change of the orthologous genes ( -6.1-fold ) was subtler than for the S. enterica-specific gene set ( mean -21.2-fold ) , which included the T3SS and associated effector genes ( Dataset S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We also determined the distribution of down-regulated genes among genomic islands [ 24 ] , including prophages , pathogenicity islands ( SPI-islands ) and additional regions of difference ( ROD ) between S. enterica and S. bongori ( Dataset S2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">For this we used a BLAST-based comparison of genome-wide synteny between S. Typhimurium and S. bongori and identified 50 ROD that included 17 previously reported SPI-islands and prophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Of the 133 down-regulated genes identified , 56 were present within genomic islands ( Table 1 ) , with a mean change in gene expression of -25.3-fold in DeltassrB cells .</sentence>
