Hfq control of biological processes 
While the role of Hfq as a global regulator has become increasingly appreciated over the past few years, the actual extent of Hfq regulation of translation remains unknown. We observed changes in expression for approximately50% of the observed Salmonella Typhimurium proteome based on an ANOVA analysis (p<0.05) (Table S1). The proteins affected represent a broad spectrum of Salmonella proteins required for many biological processes including general metabolism, the translational machinery, stress response, and virulence-assocaited processes as described next. General metabolism Proteome profiling data suggested Hfq regulates nucleoside (DeoABC) and nucleotide metabolism (CarAB, PurUBCMHAD, Ndk) under AMM conditions, as well as regulates ribose metabolism and transport (RbsABK) under AMM-2. Hfq also appears to play a significant role in central metabolism based on observed differential regulation of numerous proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the TCA pathway, pyruvate decarboxylation and the pentose phosphate shunt (see Table S1). Other metabolic processes regulated by Hfq include Fatty acid metabolism (FadA, FadB, FabA, FabZ, fbab, AccB, Acs, FabG, FabF, FabI, FabB); Arginine catabolism (AstABCD); and Propanoite catabolism (PrpBCDE). Examination of the transcript levels of the corresponding genes showed no significant change in mRNA expression levels relative to wildtype, suggesting that Hfq provides most of the control of these pathways for the growth conditions monitored.
