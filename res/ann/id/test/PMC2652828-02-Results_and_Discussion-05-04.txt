Virulence-associated 
LPS (lipopolysaccharide) has long been known as an essential component of virulence of Gram negative pathogens and, more recently, the agonist for toll like receptor 4. Hfq differentially regulated the expression of several proteins involved in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) biosynthesis in acidic minimal media. LpxA and LpxD involved in Lipid A synthesis, TolC involved in LPS Core completion, as well as proteins involved in O-antigen synthesis (RfbACKMGJU), appeared as up-regulated in the Deltahfq mutant strain suggesting that Hfq may normally down regulate expression within the host. Complementary transcriptional analysis revealed no change in the corresponding mRNA levels relative to the wildtype. Reduced expression of LPS and alterations in LPS modification has been reported for intracellular Salmonella [41], [42], [43]. Our results suggest Hfq plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of several two component systems including three that have been shown to be essential for virulence in a variety of animal models; SsrA/B, PhoP/Q, and OmpR/EnvZ. Two component systems are widespread methods of sensing external conditions and responding by altering gene expression in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and archaea. Well known two component regulators respond to osmolarity, nitrogen and oxygen limitation [44], [45]. As such, they are critical to the ability of pathogenic bacteria to adapt and survive following environmental changes. In addition to the three mentioned above Hfq negatively modulates PhoB involved in the phosphate starvation response, RstA, NarP, RcsB, BasR, and CpxR. Microarray analysis showed no effect on transcription of these genes. Salmonella motility enhances cell contact thereby increasing host cell invasion. A recent study showed that an Deltahfq mutant that was non-motile exhibited an invasion defect [20]. Analysis of protein expression in the Deltahfq strain showed reduced expression of SPI-1 TTSS components and the flagellar subunit protein FliC compared to the wildtype Salmonella strain. Consistent with this previous study, we observed reduced expression of SPI-1 invasion proteins and numerous motility proteins in the Deltahfq mutant strain primarily in the log phase growth condition compared to the wildtype strain. Among the SPI-1 invasion proteins were PrgI, SptP, SipD, SicA, InvC and InvG, and the motility proteins FliC, FliT, FliB, CheZ, CheY, and CheW. Microarray results revealed a reduction in mRNA expression of the SPI-1 TTSS and several flagellar proteins, including FliC, FliO, and FliN grown under LB Log growth conditions. This reduction in mRNA expression suggests that Hfq regulates motility and invasion at the transcription level, presumably by modulating one of the upstream regulators. Regulatory elements are generally not made at high levels and thus difficult to identify and quantify. Analysis of our data however demonstrated the upstream regulator for motility flgM [46] was poorly expressed in an Deltahfq mutant.
