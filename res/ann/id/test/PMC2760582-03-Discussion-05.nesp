<sentence id="3">In contrast , two genes kdgK and pckA involved in energy metabolism in the TCA cycle were upregulated in P. temperata [ 54,55 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Genes related to the TCA cycle have been also found to be induced in other bacteria upon host infection , for example in P. luminescens in the presence of G. mellonella homogenate [ 16 ] and in Vibrio cholerae upon infection of infant mice [ 56,57 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , as a cofactor in the metabolism of fatty acids and leucine , biotin plays a role in TCA cycle by assisting in metabolic reactions and helping to transfer carbon dioxide [ 58 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , upregulation of bioB encoding a biontin synthetase protein further <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that TCA cycle is involved in P. temperata</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="8">Induction of cysK gene in P. temperata <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="4"> cysteine <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be required when growing in the insect , but <scope type="spec" id="5"> lysine <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be needed for X. koppenhoeferi as lysC gene was induced</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Isolation of P. temperata def , encoding an amino acid tRNA synthesis enzyme N-formylmethionylaminoacyl-tRNA deformylase , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> reflect the importance of specific amino acids involved in the translation process during growth in the insect host</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Indeed , the pathway analysis reveals that def gene product interacts with CysS , a cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase ( see Additional file 1 ) , also <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggesting</cue> the requirement for cysteine in P. temperata during infection</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="14">The signal peptidase II encoded by lspA gene induced in P. temperata belongs to a class of aspartyl proteases .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Since the product of lspA has been <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggested</cue> as an important virulence factor operating via maturation of several lipoproteins [ 60 ] , we postulate that the product of lspA <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> play a pathological role in P. temperata by cleaving some core proteins and thus influencing bacterial life cycle in the insect host</scope></scope> .</sentence>
