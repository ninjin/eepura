Introduction 
Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) is widespread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and has only recently been recognized as playing a prominent role in the regulation of cellular processes. In bacteria, regulatory sRNAs act via base-pairing interactions with their target mRNAs to modulate their translation and/or decay [1], [2], in a reaction typically dependent on the RNA-binding protein Hfq [3], [4]. While the role of DNA-binding proteins, particularly transcription factors, in regulating gene expression at the level of transcription has received much attention, how RNA-binding proteins control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level remains unclear. The RNA-binding protein Hfq was initially shown to be the host factor required for replication of Qbeta RNA bacteriophage [5] and is a member of the Sm protein family of RNA binding proteins that also include eukaryotic proteins required for mRNA splicing [6], [7]. Hfq is a highly conserved protein encoded within many bacterial genomes and at least one archaeon genome [7], [8]. In bacteria, Hfq functions as a post-transcriptional regulator that modulates the stability and translation of mRNAs chiefly by facilitating sRNA-mRNA interactions [1], [4], [9]. Its broad role in regulation at the translational level has recently been hinted at by Sittka and co-workers [10]. The RNA-binding protein SmpB specifically interacts with the sRNA tmRNA (also known as ssrA and 10Sa) and is required for all known functions of tmRNA [11]. Indeed SmpB deletion mutants have been observed to have the same phenotype as tmRNA deletion mutants [11]. tmRNA is found in a wide range of bacteria and in the mitochondria of some eukaryotes and uniquely exhibits properties of both tRNA and mRNA [12], [13], [14]. tmRNA functions as a part of the translational quality control process, recognizing and binding to ribosomes that become stalled. Once bound, tmRNA adds a peptide tag to the nascent partially synthesized protein chain which targets it for degradation by C-terminal-specific cellular proteases [15], [16], [17], [18]. Usually classified as a housekeeping or repair system, a role for tmRNA as a regulatory sRNA has been recently suggested. Ranquet and Gottesman [19] report that the sRNA tmRNA plays a regulatory role in gene expression and is required for the correct high-level translation of RpoS. Recent reports suggest that both Hfq and SmpB play essential roles in bacterial pathogenesis. For example an Deltahfq mutant derivative in the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) was found to attenuate virulence in mice and was impaired in the invasion of non-phagocytic cells [20]. Hfq was also reported to be essential for Vibrio cholerae virulence, with sRNAs in conjunction with Hfq suggested as likely critical regulators of Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity [21]. Robertson and Roop demonstrated that a Brucella abortus Deltahfq mutant failed to replicate in cultured murine macrophages, and displayed attenuated virulence in a mouse model [22]. In another study, a smpB mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium exhibited defects in intra-macrophage survival, a model of Salmonella pathogenesis [23]. More recently mutation of tmRNA was shown to be responsible for a marked reduction in Salmonella Typhimurium virulence in BALB/c mice [24]. In Yersinia pseudotuberculosis mutations of smpB and tmRNA generated a bacterium that exhibited defects in survival and replication in macrophages and was avirulent in mice [25]. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Hfq and SmpB are essential for regulating virulence by controlling translation of key components. Identifying what proteins are actually regulated by Hfq and SmpB is an important step in understanding the impact of post-transcriptional gene regulation in Enterobacteria and more specifically how Hfq and SmpB control Salmonella gene expression at the post-transcriptional/ translational level and the role that this may play in Salmonella pathogenesis. Towards the global identification of Hfq targets, previous efforts have employed a combination of co-immunoprecipiatation (co-IP) and or microarray analysis. Zhang et al. [26] used high-density microarrays to detect potential targets of Hfq co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq-specific antibodies. In a recent study Sittka et al. [10] used high-throughput pyrosequencing (HTPS) to detect potential targets of an epitope tagged-Hfq protein co-immunoprecipitated with commercially available antibodies, overcoming the limitations of the previous strategy; the need for custom microarrays and specialized antibodies. In another study [27] microarray analysis was used to identify changes in gene expression resulting from lack of Hfq, thus providing potential new target genes for sRNA regulation. While co- immunoprecipiatation has proven valuable in identifying targets of Hfq, and thus targets of translational regulation, one possible criticism of this approach is that the RNA co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq may be brought down simply because Hfq strongly binds to RNA molecules and that the binding is somewhat non-specific. In addition, it is clear that a transcriptional analysis solely can not distinguish between transcriptional and translational/post-transcriptional regulatory effects. Using sample-matched transcriptomics and proteomics measurements it is possible to accurately characterize on a global scale control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Here, we performed sample-matched global proteomics and transcriptional analyses together with cellular assays and animal studies to begin to understand how Hfq and SmpB control Salmonella gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and the role that this may play in Salmonella pathogenesis. Our global analyses revealed that a relatively high percentage of all the annotated Salmonella genes (>20%) are regulated post-transcriptionally either directly or indirectly. The extent of global regulation of translation is much greater than previously thought [10], with profound effects in all stages of Salmonella's life cycle including a variety of house keeping pathways and known and novel virulence factors, in part explaining the requirement of both translational regulators for virulence in Salmonella. This study represents one of the first comparative global analyses of post-transcriptional regulation in any organism; the data suggest post-transcriptional regulation is widespread and plays an important role in virulence regulation and environmental adaptation for Salmonella.
