<sentence id="0">Conclusion</sentence>
<sentence id="1">E. faecalis OG1RF carries a number of unique loci compared to V583 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Those of particular interest include new surface proteins ( MSCRAMMs and WxL domain proteins ) , an operon encoding myo-inositol utilization , an intact competence operon , and two CRISPR elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The CRISPR elements <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be of particular significance when one considers that most of what is missing from OG1RF compared to V583 consists of mobile genetic elements ( MGEs ) , including 6 phages or remnants thereof</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The presence of the CRISPR elements in OG1RF provides a tantalizing , but as yet unproven , explanation for the discordance in the number of mobile elements between these two strains .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The acquisition of MGE is <cue type="spec" id="1">believed</cue> to be an important mechanism by which the species E. faecalis had been able to generate genetic diversity and , thereby , highly variable phenotypes [ 4</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It has been proposed that the ability of E. faecalis to cause healthcare related infections is associated with these MGEs [ 4,5 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This hypothesis was supported by several studies that have highlighted the importance of virulence determinants carried by these mobile elements , such as cytolysin [ 57 ] by the PAI .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , more recent results from Aakra et al. [ 53 ] and Lepage et al. [ 36 ] demonstrate that these factors <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be present in harmless strains</scope> while absent in clinical isolates , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> E. faecalis virulence is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> dependent on any single virulence factor</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Indeed , few studies have compared the virulence pattern of strains from various origins .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The increased ability of OG1RF to infect kidneys and to produce biofilm , despite the absence of MGEs and their associated virulence factors , was surprising .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="spec" id="5"> Different possibilities can be <cue type="spec" id="5">proposed</cue> relating to the factors important for these differences in enterococcal infections</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">One of these is that virulence in the assays used <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be linked to the shared core genome of these two strains , with the differences arising from the unique genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">On the other hand , virulence could be associated primarily with the genes unique to each strain , but with each set being able to complement the absence of the other .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">It <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">seems</cue> most <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">likely</cue> that virulence , and/or some combination of virulence and fitness , is caused by the expression of a mixture of both the core and unique genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">It is also important to remember that E. faecalis is a well adapted commensal , carrying the genes necessary to survive and to colonize the gut , and that a subset , particularly MLST CC2 and CC9 [ 58 ] , predominates among hospital acquired infections .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">It <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> be that these clonal complexes are <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> more virulent per se</scope></scope> , as defined in the assays described here , but rather are better able to survive and/or colonize hospitalized patients , taking advantage of factors that predispose to nosocomial infections such as urinary or venous catheters , or mucositis , among others .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Sequencing of more E. faecalis strains <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">may</cue> facilitate our understanding of the path from commensalism to pathogenicity , a crucial prerequisite for designing therapeutic interventions directed to control an organism that is already resistant to a large spectrum of antibiotics</scope> .</sentence>
