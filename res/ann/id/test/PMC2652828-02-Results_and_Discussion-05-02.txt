Translation 
Hfq also appears to play a role in the regulation of the translational machinery itself presumably as a feedback mechanism to maintain tight control over the amount of ribosomal synthesis. Several ribosomal proteins including RpsM, RpsG, RpmD, and RplN exhibited a marked reduction in both protein and mRNA levels in the Deltahfq mutant strain compared to the wildtype under LB Stat growth condition. One hallmark of growth under nutrient poor conditions is lower expression of the machinery necessary to synthesize proteins, including tRNA synthetases and other factors. In fact all of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (IleS, ProS, CysS, GlnS, AspS, ArgS, GltX, AlaS, TrpS, GlyS, GlyQ) observed were up-regulated in the Deltahfq mutant relative to the wild type without a concurrent change in transcription. This suggests that Hfq normally represses translation of these genes under conditions that mimics the intracellular environment (AMM).
