<sentence id="1">An occurrence of bac gene , sak188 , sak189 TCS genes and erythromycin resistance among S. agalactiae strains A total of 239 S. agalactiae strains isolated from human and animals were studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The strains were tested by PCR for the presence of virulence gene bac and sak188 and sak189 TCS genes , which were previously found to be located on pathogenicity island [ 13 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As result , 53 strains isolated from pregnant women and 5 strains isolated from the cow 's milk were found to be bac gene positive .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">They were selected for further study .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">PCR analysis of the bac gene positive strains revealed that the presence of bac gene correlated with the presence of sensor histidine kinase gene sak188 and DNA-binding response regulator gene sak189 <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Genomic architecture of DNA fragments containing sak188 , sak189 and bac genes in S. agalactiae [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , and rr06 , hk06 and cbpA genes in S. pneumoniae [ 22 ] is presented in the Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">For the purpose of insertional inactivation , the vector pVA891-2 that provides erythromycin ( Em ) resistance was used .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , the strains were additionally screened for sensitivity to Em. As result , most of human bac gene positive strains showed resistance or intermediate resistance to Em in the standard diffusion disk test , that is in agreement with previous observations demonstrating an increase in Em resistance in S. agalactiae population [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">One of the strains , 168/00 , which demonstrated the large diameter of growth inhibition zone , was selected for further study .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In this strain , the bac gene has unique allele with the closest similarity with 676a and 676b alleles according to classification of Kong et al. [ 32 ] .</sentence>
