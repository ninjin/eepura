Genes involved in intracellular metabolism 
Induction of different metabolism genes in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus during insect infection highlights the differences in metabolic changes between the two bacteria. Three genes, aceE, aceK and dld, whose products catalyze subsequent steps of the glyoxylate pathway [53], were induced in X. koppenhoeferi. In contrast, two genes kdgK and pckA involved in energy metabolism in the TCA cycle were upregulated in P. temperata [54,55]. Genes related to the TCA cycle have been also found to be induced in other bacteria upon host infection, for example in P. luminescens in the presence of G. mellonella homogenate [16] and in Vibrio cholerae upon infection of infant mice [56,57]. Further, as a cofactor in the metabolism of fatty acids and leucine, biotin plays a role in TCA cycle by assisting in metabolic reactions and helping to transfer carbon dioxide [58]. Therefore, upregulation of bioB encoding a biontin synthetase protein further suggests that TCA cycle is involved in P. temperata. Induction of different amino acid biosynthetic genes may suggest the differences in amino acid requirements in the two bacteria during infection. Induction of cysK gene in P. temperata suggests that cysteine may be required when growing in the insect, but lysine may be needed for X. koppenhoeferi as lysC gene was induced. Isolation of P. temperata def, encoding an amino acid tRNA synthesis enzyme N-formylmethionylaminoacyl-tRNA deformylase, may reflect the importance of specific amino acids involved in the translation process during growth in the insect host. Indeed, the pathway analysis reveals that def gene product interacts with CysS, a cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (see Additional file 1), also suggesting the requirement for cysteine in P. temperata during infection. Genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation can also be distinguished between the two bacteria. A protease gene, clpP, involved in protein degradation, was induced in X. koppenhoeferi upon infection. In fact proteases have been identified as virulence factors in some other bacterial pathogens [59]. The signal peptidase II encoded by lspA gene induced in P. temperata belongs to a class of aspartyl proteases. Since the product of lspA has been suggested as an important virulence factor operating via maturation of several lipoproteins [60], we postulate that the product of lspA may play a pathological role in P. temperata by cleaving some core proteins and thus influencing bacterial life cycle in the insect host.
