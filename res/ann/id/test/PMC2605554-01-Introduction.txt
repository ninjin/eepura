Introduction 
Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) is a Gram-positive, human-specific pathogen responsible for over 500,000 deaths each year [1]. Severe invasive GAS infections such as necrotizing fasciitis account for approximately 30% of these deaths, and the incidence of such acute conditions has been on the rise since the mid 1980's [2]. This resurgence has been paralleled by the emergence of a globally disseminated GAS cone belonging to serotype M1T1 [3]-[5]. While the M1T1 GAS has become the most common cause of streptococcal pharyngitis, this clone is also overrepresented in cases of severe invasive disease [6], [7]. Studies of M1T1 clinical isolates from invasive disease cases have revealed an inverse relationship between expression of the extracellular cysteine protease SpeB and clinical severity [8]. The existence of a SpeB-negative invasive phenotype has been hypothesized that results from mutations in the regulator covR/S [9]. SpeB is a secreted cysteine protease initially expressed as 40 kDa zymogen which is then converted to the 28 kDa active form by autocatalytic processing [10]. SpeB is known to cleave numerous host proteins including components of the extracellular matrix, cytokine precursors, immunoglobulins and antimicrobial peptides [11]-[13], which could interfere with host immune functions. However, SpeB has also been shown to cleave a range of GAS proteins such as the fibrinogen-binding M1 protein [14], [15], various superantigens [16], [17], the secreted plasminogen activator streptokinase [18] as well as the DNase Sda1 [17], and thus possibly interfere with the proven virulence functions of these bacterial factors. The precise role(s) of SpeB throughout the course of infection are undoubtedly complex, and not surprisingly, different studies using different in vivo animal models have produced seemingly contradictory results [19]-[21]. In this study we examined the effect of a natural mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB (also known as Rgg [22]) identified in a SpeB-negative GAS clinical isolate. RopB is a GAS transcriptional regulator that has been shown to be essential for expression of SpeB and binds directly to the promoter region of speB [23], [24]. In studies performed in different GAS serotype strains, RopB has variably been suggested to be involved in the regulation of other GAS genes including those associated with metabolism of non-glucose carbohydrates and amino acids [25], [26], response to thermal and oxidative stress [25], [27] and the expression of virulence factors including DNases (MF-1 and MF-3) and hemolysins (streptolysin S and streptolysin O) [26], [28], [29]. Subsequent investigations into the effect of RopB on virulence have yielded differing results. A study utilizing a zebrafish intramuscular infection model with serotype M5 GAS showed that inactivation of RopB resulted in decreased virulence [30], whereas a study utilizing a murine intraperitoneal infection model with serotype M49 GAS showed that inactivation of RopB resulted in increased virulence [27]. While such global differences in virulence effects could in part result from the differing animal models used, it may also reflect strain-specific variation in the RopB regulon. For example, separate studies have shown ropB mutation to have either no effect on hemolysis and DNase activity or, alternatively, to increase expression of hemolysin and DNase-encoding genes and the associated phenotypic activities [23], [26]. This strain-specific variation is highlighted in a recent work by Dmitriev et al. [29] that shows inter- and intra-serotypic variation in the transcriptome of ropB mutant GAS, with only members of the SpeB operon being commonly regulated in all strains tested. It is in the light of the current uncertainty surrounding RopB and its role in virulence that we sought to investigate the role of this transcriptional regulator in the serotype M1T1 GAS background that is the leading agent of severe human infection. This analysis begins with a naturally-occuring mutation in ropB identified in one such strain.
