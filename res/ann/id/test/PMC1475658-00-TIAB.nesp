<sentence id="0">Prevalence of Local Immune Response against Oral Infection in a Drosophila/Pseudomonas Infection Model</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Pathogens have developed multiple strategies that allow them to exploit host resources and resist the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To study how Drosophila flies deal with infectious diseases in a natural context , we investigated the interactions between Drosophila and a newly identified entomopathogen , Pseudomonas entomophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Flies orally infected with P. entomophila rapidly succumb despite the induction of both local and systemic immune responses , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> this bacterium has developed specific strategies to escape the fly immune response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using a combined genetic approach on both host and pathogen , we showed that P. entomophila virulence is multi-factorial with a clear differentiation between factors that trigger the immune response and those that promote pathogenicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrate that AprA , an abundant secreted metalloprotease produced by P. entomophila , is an important virulence factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inactivation of aprA attenuated both the capacity to persist in the host and pathogenicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , aprA mutants were able to survive to wild-type levels in immune-deficient Relish flies , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the protease plays an important role in protection against the Drosophila immune response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our study also reveals that the major contribution to the fly defense against P. entomophila is provided by the local , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">rather than</cue> the systemic immune response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">More precisely , our data points to an important role for the antimicrobial peptide Diptericin against orally infectious Gram-negative bacteria , emphasizing the critical role of local antimicrobial peptide expression against food-borne pathogens .</sentence>
