Genome-wide SsrB interactions 
To examine SsrB allocation on the chromosome in vivo, we isolated functional SsrB-DNA interactions using chromatin immunoprecipitation and examined the bound DNA by chip analysis (ChIP-on-chip) using an S. Typhimurium SL1344 array containing 44,021 probes. With this method, we identified 256 significant interaction peaks distributed throughout the genome that were enriched under SsrB-activating conditions and with interaction scores three standard deviations greater than the mean probe score (Figure 2A and Table 1). Of these 256 peaks, 126 (49%) occurred within coding regions of genes (CDS) and 130 (51%) were in intergenic regions (IGR). Given the strong influence of SsrB on horizontally acquired genes (Table 1), we plotted the ChIP-on-chip data against all genomic islands in S. Typhimurium SL1344. From this analysis, 62 of 256 SsrB binding peaks (24.3%) occurred within genomic islands (Figure 2B). SsrB ChIP peaks were observed upstream of previously identified SsrB regulated genes indicating that our ChIP-on-chip data captured functional interactions (Dataset S3). To generate a consensus set of SsrB regulated genes, we performed an analysis to identify operons in the S. Typhimurium SL1344 genome that encoded at least one gene down-regulated in DeltassrB cells and that possessed an SsrB binding peak in the upstream regulatory region as defined by our ChIP-on-chip analysis. From this, the 133 down-regulated genes mapped to 86 operons, 49 of which had an SsrB interaction upstream or within the first gene of the operon (Table 2). This analysis captured all five reported operons in the SPI-2 genomic island in addition to ten operons outside of this island that encode SPI-2 translocated effectors.
