<sentence id="0">Regulatory evolution of the SPI-2 T3SS effector repertoire</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The above results identified the conserved , yet flexible , palindrome sequence defining DNA recognition by SsrB .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To examine the extent to which regulatory evolution has been selective for this genetic architecture , we created a position weight matrix ( PWM ) for the five strongest palindrome sites in SPI-2 and the orthologous sites in Sodalis SSR-3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We then searched for representative candidates of this motif in the S. Typhimurium genome using the simple scoring algorithm MotifLocator [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This analysis recovered the motifs upstream of ssaB , ssaG , ssaM , and ssaR that were used to generate the PWM .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The palindrome in the ssrA promoter was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> used to create the PWM due to its weaker consensus in the left heptamer , however</scope> , it was recovered in the computational analysis in a second group of lower-scoring motifs ( Figure 6A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We identified 24 palindromes co-occurring with ChIP-on-chip peaks upstream of 24 different SsrB-regulated genes or operons .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Applying a stringent threshold to the output allowed us to identify two groups - genes with high-scoring upstream palindromes ( ssaB , ssaG , ssaM , ssaR , sopD2 , sifA , sifB , sseK2 , sseK3 , sseL , sseA ' , steC , and srcA ) and those with medium-scoring palindromes ( 0.7-0.8 threshold ; ssrA , STM1633 , sseI , slrP sspH2 , pipB , sseJ , pipB2 , srfN , sseA and steB ) ( Figure 6A and Dataset S4 ) ( sseA ' denotes the SsrB palindrome sequence upstream of sseA that falls within the ssaE CDS , while sseA refers to the SsrB-footprinted IGR site with only one conserved heptamer defined in Figure 4C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Remarkably , this accounted for 17 of 22 SL1344 genome-encoded effectors translocated by the SPI-2-encoded T3SS ( exceptions are chromosomal steA , gogB , and sseK , and plasmid-encoded spvB and spvC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These genes <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">either</cue> <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacked</cue> an upstream ChIP peak above our 3-standard deviation cut-off ( sseK )</scope> or had such a peak but did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> reach statistical significance in our transcriptional profiling experiments ( steA , gogB )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our ChIP-on-chip data revealed three additional strong SsrB binding peaks within SPI-2 : one in the IGR directly upstream of ssaR , a second within the CDS for ssaJ , and a third within the CDS for ssaE that would be <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">predicted</cue> to influence transcription of the downstream effector/chaperone operon beginning with sseA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The analysis described above recovered SsrB palindrome sequences at the sseA ' and ssaR locations prompting further validation of these sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="12"><scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">No</cue> palindrome was identified for the ssaJ interaction peak and so further characterization was <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> pursued</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">For the IGR palindrome upstream of ssaR , we tested both a chromosome-integrated transcriptional fusion and an autonomous episomal reporter .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">In wild-type cells these reporters were as active as other SPI-2 promoters , whereas promoter activity was abrogated in DeltassrB cells , implicating this IGR as a functional promoter for ssaR ( Figure 6B and Figure S4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">We next tested the function of the intragenic palindrome within ssaE ( sseA ' ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">For this , we constructed a single-copy transcriptional reporter that either contained ( WT PsseA ) or <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">lacked</cue> ( PsseA del ) the single heptamer site in the sseA IGR</scope> and integrated this reporter into wild-type cells and mutants <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">lacking</cue> either ssrB or the ssaE coding sequence</scope> that removed the high-scoring intragenic palindrome sseA ' .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">These experiments showed that the sseA ' sequence contributes approximately 75 % of transcriptional output at the sseA promoter ( Figure 6C ) , since deleting the single heptamer in the sseA IGR had little effect on transcriptional output in any of the strain backgrounds .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">These reporter data are in line with the respective binding scores for the ChIP-on-chip interaction peaks ( Figure 3 ) and the sequence similarity for these elements with respect to the consensus palindrome ( Figure 6A and Figure 4D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Together , these data provide compelling evidence for the identity of the DNA recognition element that has been selected through evolution to co-regulate an SsrB-dependent gene program involved in adaptation to a host .</sentence>
