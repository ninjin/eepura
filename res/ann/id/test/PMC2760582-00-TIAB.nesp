<sentence id="0">Comparative in vivo gene expression of the closely related bacteria Photorhabdus temperata and Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi upon infection of the same insect host , Rhizotrogus majalis</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are Gram-negative , phylogenetically related , enterobacteria , forming mutualism with the entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis and Steinernema , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mutualistic bacteria living in the intestines of the nematode infective juveniles are pathogenic to the insect upon release by the nematodes into the insect hemolymph .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Such a switch needs activation of genes that promote bacterial virulence .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We studied in vivo gene expression in Photorhabdus temperata and Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi upon infection of the white grub Rhizotrogus majalis using selective capture of transcribed sequences technique .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Results A total of 40 genes in P. temperata and 39 in X. koppenhoeferi were found to be upregulated in R. majalis hemolymph at 24 h post infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Genomic presence or upregulation of these genes specific in either one of the bacterium was confirmed by the assay of comparative hybridization , and the changes of randomly selected genes were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The identified genes could be broadly divided into seven functional groups including cell surface structure , regulation , virulence and secretion , stress response , intracellular metabolism , nutrient scavenging , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The two bacteria shared more genes in stress response category than any other functional group .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">More than 60 % of the identified genes were uniquely induced in either bacterium <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> vastly different molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity to the same insect host</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In P. temperata lysR gene encoding transcriptional activator was induced , while genes yijC and rseA encoding transcriptional repressors were induced in X. koppenhoeferi .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Lipopolysaccharide synthesis gene lpsE was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in P. temperata</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Except tcaC and hemolysin related genes , other virulence genes were different between the two bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Genes involved in TCA cycle were induced in P. temperata whereas those involved in glyoxylate pathway were induced in X. koppenhoeferi , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> differences in metabolism between the two bacteria in the same insect host</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Upregulation of genes encoding different types of nutrient uptake systems further emphasized the differences in nutritional requirements of the two bacteria in the same insect host .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Photorhabdus temperata displayed upregulation of genes encoding siderophore-dependent iron uptake system , but X. koppenhoeferi upregulated genes encoding siderophore-independent ion uptake system .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Photorhabdus temperata induced genes for amino acid acquisition but X. koppenhoeferi upregulated malF gene , encoding a maltose uptake system .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Further analyses identified <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> mechanistic associations between the identified gene products in metabolic pathways , providing an interactive model of pathogenesis for each bacterium species</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Conclusion This study identifies set of genes induced in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi upon infection of R. majalis , and highlights differences in molecular features used by these two closely related bacteria to promote their pathogenicity in the same insect host .</sentence>
