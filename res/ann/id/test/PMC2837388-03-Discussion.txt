Discussion 
Horizontal gene transfer is a well-recognized mechanism of bacterial evolution that gives rise to new phenotypes due to the coordinated expression of novel genetic components [1]. A good example of this is acquisition of type III secretion by mutualists and pathogenic bacteria enabling new colonization strategies within a host [33],[34]. Evolved changes to regulatory circuitry can also give rise to phenotypic diversity at the species level [19]. In both cases, regulatory evolution is required to correctly deploy gene products during infection, yet the extent to which regulatory evolution contributes to pathogenic adaptation is only beginning to be realized [8]. The SsrA-SsrB two-component regulatory system in S. enterica has been the focus of our efforts to understand the significance of regulatory evolution for pathogenic adaptation. This regulatory system was co-acquired with a T3SS encoded in the SPI-2 pathogenicity island and likely contributed to immediate and gradual phenotypic diversity as new regulatory nodes were explored and acted upon by natural selection. Extensive work has been reported on the characterization of SsrB dependent genes, including functional evaluation of genes encoded within SPI-2 in addition to genome-wide transcriptional studies [14],[15]. In this study we identified genes co-expressed under SsrB-inducing conditions and found those with strong levels of expression localized predominantly to mobile genetic elements, recently acquired genomic islands or other annotated islands. We also identified many weakly co-expressed genes, some of which may represent ancestral Salmonella genes recruited into the SsrB regulon like the previously reported srfN [18]. Some of these genes may not be directly regulated by SsrB and will require further experimental investigation. Direct profiling of SsrB-DNA interactions using ChIP-on-chip was used to identify SsrB binding sites in the genome. This analysis identified many interactions which have not been previously described and interaction sites within coding regions of genes which may represent non-canonical functions for SsrB. Other groups have reported the existence of similar numbers of ChIP-on-chip interactions within intragenic regions for other transcription factors [35],[36] suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to SsrB. In light of the disparate number of microarray genes in comparison to ChIP-on-chip peaks we attempted to generate a more comprehensive picture of the SsrB regulon by combining these data sets at the operon level. In doing so we believe that the nineteen operons containing differentially expressed genes determined by microarray and containing a ChIP-on-chip peak three standard deviations above the mean captured by this analysis represent the genes directly activated by SsrB (Table 2). Those operons having a ChIP-on-chip peak directly upstream in the IGR region encompass the majority of known SsrB regulated genes while those possessing a ChIP peak within the CDS of the first gene may represent non-functional interactions that deserve follow-up experimental investigation. The ChIP-on-chip data not only provided information on the identities of SsrB-regulated genes but also gave insight as to the identity of the SsrB recognition element specified by the interaction site sequences. The regulatory architecture governing SsrB input has been elusive despite several SsrB footprints being defined biochemically [19],[25],[26]. Our ChIP-on-chip data further suggested that SsrB binding within SPI-2 was specific, with binding peaks overlapping precisely with regions of the DNA footprinted by SsrB [25],[26]. By using a genetic screening strategy together with functional and comparative genomics, we were able to define the essential SsrB regulatory element as being an 18-bp palindrome with a conserved 7-4-7 internal organization. In support of the palindrome as the functional entity we showed the loss of SsrB dependence as a result of deletion of this element for the ssaG promoter. Evaluation of the 7-4-7 palindrome in the ssaG promoter revealed the minimal architecture and sequence orientation required for transcriptional input. Deletion of the entire palindrome resulted in less than 1% activity in wild-type cells, an equivalent level of activity to those lacking ssrB entirely. A search of the S. enterica genome for this palindromic motif revealed candidates upstream of the previously noted SsrB dependent genes, including two additional SPI-2 sites; one IGR site upstream of ssaR that until now had been cryptic, and one intragenic palindrome upstream of sseA in the ssaE CDS. In both cases these input sites were found to be functional. Although palindrome architecture was conserved upstream of SsrB-regulated genes, degenerate palindromes in which one half-site was more conserved were also functional. As a result of our mutational analyses we conclude that so long as the orientation of a single heptamer of the palindrome is conserved with respect to the downstream gene, SsrB is tolerant of degeneracy in the adjacent spacer and heptamer sequences. While we were able to identify a number of limited palindrome-like sequences from our bacterial one-hybrid screen, this tolerance in addition to the library size required to pull out an 18-bp palindrome in large numbers may explain why we isolated functional single heptamer sequences and why degenerate palindromes naturally exist in the genome. A recent report by Carroll et al, postulated that SsrB first interacts with DNA as a monomer, followed by dimerization [32]. Our findings also suggest that dimerization is likely required for transcriptional activation however strong recognition by one monomer may stabilize interaction of a second monomer with a less than ideal sequence. The finding that a flexible palindromic sequence can be selective for SsrB input raises many interesting questions around the nature of regulatory evolution. The ability to use a short functional half-site adjacent to an uncharacterized threshold level of tolerated bases would reduce the period of neutral evolution required to generate an inverted repeat sequence twice the length [37], and would limit the loss of intermediate variations to drift while a more desirable palindrome is created by regulatory evolution. For bacteria that make use of horizontal gene transfer, this could increase the tempo with which new DNA is integrated into the regulatory circuitry of the cell. We showed that the SsrB regulatory palindrome is also present in the orthologous SSR-3 island of the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius and that the palindrome evolved in Sodalis can act as a cis regulatory input function in Salmonella. Thus, in addition to supporting a pathogenic lifestyle within a host in Salmonella, it seems probable that this common promoter architecture may direct the activation of the SSR-3 T3SS of S. glossinidius in its endosymbiotic relationship with the tsetse fly host, although we acknowledge this requires experimental validation. The SSR-3 region in S. glossinidius is fully conserved in gene synteny and content with that of SPI-2 [31], with the exception of two effector genes missing in SSR-3 (sseF and sseG) that are required to localize vacuolar Salmonella to the perinuclear Golgi in host cells [38],[39]. The SsrB ortholog in S. glossinidius is approximately30% divergent with SsrB at the protein level, initially leading us to think that they might have different binding site preferences. To the contrary, high local conservation in the promoters evolved in Salmonella and Sodalis was the crux in defining the functional SsrB input among stochastic noise. This analysis revealed strong palindrome sequence conservation in five promoters identified in SPI-2 and in the orthologous sequences in Sodalis SSR-3. Among palindrome-containing promoters, the ssrA promoter is exceptional for two reasons: a lack of conservation between Salmonella and Sodalis, and the evolution of tandem palindromes in Salmonella. One possible interpretation of this divergent regulatory architecture in front of ssrA might relate to bacterial lifestyle. Salmonella may have retained or evolved SsrB input here to create a positive feedback loop on the regulatory system to rapidly adapt to the host environment during infection, similar to transcriptional surge described for the PhoP response regulator [40]. The endosymbiotic relationship of Sodalis with the tsetse fly - where long-term vertical transmission has ostensibly been formative in shaping regulatory circuitry at certain promoters - may obviate the need for rapid transcriptional surge, leading to regulatory drift or selection against positive feedback. With the structure of SsrB available [32] and its recognized sequence now identified, future studies will be able to build a picture of how SsrB interacts with both its target DNA, RNA polymerase and potentially other transcription factors including nucleoid associated proteins in order to direct transcription of its regulon. In summary, this work highlights the evolutionary significance of cis-regulatory mutation for the adaptation of Salmonella to a host animal. The DNA module that choreographs SsrB-mediated pathogenic behaviour in Salmonella appears to have been conserved for mutualism as well, thereby shedding new light on the significance of cis-regulatory mutations for bacteria evolving in different ecological settings.
