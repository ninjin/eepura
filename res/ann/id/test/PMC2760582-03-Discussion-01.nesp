<sentence id="1">Our gene expression data reveal similarities and differences in molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity by the two bacteria with apparently similar biology .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As depicted in the conceptual molecular model ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">5 ) , apart from a relatively small number of common strategies used by P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi to cause infection of R. majalis , most upregulated genes were different between the two bacteria , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> vastly different pathways to bring about infection of the same insect host</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Genes involved in cell structure modification As the physical contact between bacteria and their host is accomplished by the outer surface , the bacterial cell envelope is crucial for communication and interaction with host cells during infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Genes involved in the synthesis of outer membrane proteins ( skp in P. temperata and ompF in X. koppenhoeferi ) and flagella ( fliA in P. temperata and fliM in X. koppenhoeferi ) were induced in both bacteria , indicating the importance of surface proteins in this bacteria-insect interface .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Outer membrane proteins <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> contribute to the modulation of bacterial cell surface properties during interaction with the host , thus playing a role in evading host immune response [ 18 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Flagellum-mediated motility <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> provide an advantage for infection by attachment to the host surface [ 19,20</scope> ] , whereas it has been reported in X. nematophila that <scope type="neg" id="2">the expression of virulence factors is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> controlled by the regulation of flagella motility [ 21</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Gene dacC encoding a peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> in P. temperata</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">implying</cue> that peptidoglycan undergoes structural alterations in X. koppenhoeferi that <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">probably</cue> add to its fitness when residing in the host</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">As a well-defined virulence factor playing a major role in the development of septicemia [ 22 ] , lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene lpsE was induced in X. koppenhoeferi , but <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> in P. temperata</scope> , which <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> explain in part why relatively slower growing X. koppenhoeferi did <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> differ from P. temperata in virulence to R. majalis in our previous studies [ 17</scope></scope> ] .</sentence>
