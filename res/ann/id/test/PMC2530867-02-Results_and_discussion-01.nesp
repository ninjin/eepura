<sentence id="1">General genome features The complete circular chromosome of OG1RF was found to be 2,739,625 bp with an average G+C content of 37.8 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The complete OG1RF sequence was obtained using three independent techniques ( Solexa , the 454 , and Sanger sequencing technique ) with a higher than classic coverage ( more than 100 times ) , diminishing the likelihood of sequencing-related frameshifts , base errors and/or misassembly .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A comparison of our assembly of the closed OG1RF genome with the restriction map of OG1RF published by Murray et al. [ 10 ] showed only minor variations ( primarily an overestimation of 30 kb for the Sfi I fragment E , 540 kb versus 509 kb predicted from the sequence ; Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found 232 kb of OG1RF unique sequences distributed in 48 regions ranging from 101 bp to approximately 49 kb in length ( Figure 1 ; Additional data file 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using the published DNA sequence of V583 as reference ( NC_004668 ) , OG1RF shares 2,474 ORFs as well as the 12 rRNA genes and 58 of 68 tRNA genes ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The 10 missing tRNA are localized in a region in V583 that has been replaced in OG1RF by a 49 kb region ( see below ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Surprisingly , the genomes align syntenically , as shown in Figure 2 , despite the fact that 25 % of the V583 genome is composed of mobile elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Similarly , the presence of OG1RF-unique sequences has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affected the overall chromosomal arrangement</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Some of the major insertions/deletions in the two genomes are shown in Figure 2 , such as the absence of the pathogenicity island ( PAI ) in OG1RF and the presence of an approximately 49 kb fragment unique to OG1RF .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">However , most of the differences are small and cannot be visualized in this figure .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Overall , we found 64 areas of divergence between the genomes that can be divided into 3 classes : an additional sequence present in OG1RF when compared with V583 ; a sequence replacement where a sequence in OG1RF differs from the sequence in V583 ; and the absence of a sequence from OG1RF when compared with V583 .</sentence>
