Deltahfq and DeltasmpB Salmonella Typhimurium mutant strains are avirulent 
To directly assess the role of Hfq and SmpB in Salmonella Typhimurium pathogenesis, BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with 200 cfu of either Deltahfq mutant strain, DeltasmpB mutant strain or wildtype strain and monitored for 21 days (Figure 1). The absence of smpB and hfq attenuated Salmonella virulence; mice infected with the DeltasmpB mutant strain died at 10 days post-infection while mice infected with the Deltahfq mutant strain were fully resistant to the infection. Mice infected with wildtype strain exhibited typical symptoms of infection and died at around six days. These results are similar to those in previous reports [20], [23].
