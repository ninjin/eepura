AprA Protects P. entomophila from Antibacterial Peptides 
In bacteria, nitrogen and carbon sources are frequently provided by enzymatic degradation of extracellular biopolymers by proteases and glycosidases. Proteases, especially metalloproteases, are also known to contribute to virulence in some pathogenic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. marcescens, and Bacillus thuringiensis [20,21,26]. Molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis attributed to these proteases include degradation of structural matrices and destruction of proteins involved in host protective functions such as AMPs or complement factors. However, in most cases, attempts to evaluate the role of metalloproteases in virulence have failed to obtain conclusive results with respect to a specific function [20,21]. Thus, our approach focusing on both host and pathogen is the first to clearly demonstrate a key role of the AprA metalloprotease in the protection against AMPs in vivo. This conclusion is based on our observations that (i) aprA mutants show attenuated virulence, (ii) aprA mutants survive less well than wild-type P. entomophila in Drosophila and are more sensitive to Imd-mediated defense, and (iii) AprA provides specific protection in vivo against Diptericin. Altogether, our study reveals that local AMP expression plays an important role in defense against oral pathogens and that entomopathogens such as P. entomophila can counteract this effect by expressing aprA. It is interesting to note that S. marcescens, another potent oral pathogen of Drosophila, also expresses a protease that can degrade AMPs in vitro [12]. However, in the absence of a Serratia protease mutant, the in vivo relevance of the protease is not yet established. Taken together, this observation and our findings suggest that proteases may represent a common strategy used by Drosophila pathogens to circumvent the potent antimicrobial host defense. We cannot exclude that AprA degrades other immune effectors or participates directly as a toxic factor by degrading the gut epithelium or the peritrophic matrix. In B. thuringiensis, it has been proposed that the protease InhA2 participates in the degradation of the gut, thus facilitating the action of the Cry toxins [27,28]. Alternatively, in Photorhabdus luminescens, an AprA homologue, PrtA, has been proposed not to be a virulence factor, but rather to be involved in degrading host tissues following host death in order to promote efficient nutrition and development of its symbiotic nematode host [14,29]. The observation that injection of AprA into the hemocoel is lethal to adult flies supports the hypothesis of additional roles for the protease in bacterial pathogenesis. However, oral ingestion of purified AprA induces only low levels of lethality, indicating that AprA alone is not sufficient to kill the host via this route of entry, and other factors participate in oral toxicity.
