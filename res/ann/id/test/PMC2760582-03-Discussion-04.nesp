<sentence id="0">Genes involved in adaptation to host-induced stresses</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Compared to all other functional classes , more stress response genes were identified to be shared by P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> common themes in adaptation to host-imposed stresses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Upregulation of both surA and uspB in both bacteria <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates</cue> their importance in bacterial adaptation to global stress during insect infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Gene surA is important for bacterial survival during infection [ 41,42 ] to avoid accumulation of non-native protein conformations [ 42-44 ] , and uspB gene product is usually accumulated in the stationary phase and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">probably</cue> important for ethanol stress [ 45</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Similarly , induction of a chaperone protein encoding gene dnaK in both bacteria <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> picture common stress responses between P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi in a number of cellular processes including rescue of misfolded proteins and control of the activity of folded regulatory proteins [ 46 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The glutathione synthetase gene gshB which mediates condensation of gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine to form glutathione [ 47,48 ] was induced in P. temperata , but glutathione reductase gene gor which reduces glutathione disulfide to the sulfhydryl form of glutathione [ 47,48 ] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Glutathione plays a major role in protection against oxidative stress and in detoxification of hazardous chemicals or heavy metals [ 49 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , although gshB and gor corresponding products are involved in different glutathione biosynthesis pathways , expression of these two genes <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">possible</cue> role of detoxification mechanism in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of R. majalis</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Further , as Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria can switch their phenotypes upon insect infection , we <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">speculate</cue> that upregulation of transposase genes in both bacteria <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">may</cue> contribute to genetic variability for better adaptation and survival in a particular niche [ 50 ]</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Apart from the common mechanisms handling stresses , gene msrA encoding a peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase was unique to X. koppenhoeferi .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">As an important antioxidant enzyme , peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase mediates the repair of proteins damaged by sulfoxidation of methionine residues [ 51,52 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Products of msrA are found to interact with several other gene products ( see Additional file 2 ) , also <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggesting</cue> its importance during insect infection</scope> .</sentence>
