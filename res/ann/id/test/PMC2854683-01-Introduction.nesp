<sentence id="0">Introduction</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Group A streptococci ( GAS ) are human pathogens that infect over 700 million children and adults each year [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Whereas the overall mortality rate of GAS infections is less than 0.1 % , the mortality rate of invasive GAS infections , which have resurged in the past 30 years , mounts to 25 % ( out of > 650,000 new cases per year ) [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Among the various GAS serotypes , the globally disseminated M1T1 clonal strain remains the most frequently isolated from cases of invasive and non-invasive infections [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , and although disease severity partially depends on host genetic factors [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , M1T1 GAS possesses unique genomic features that contribute to its evolutionary fitness [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Among these features is the ability of M1T1 bacteria to switch to a hypervirulent phenotype associated with invasive diseases in vivo [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , a phenomenon that is not fully understood and whose specificity to the M1 serotype remains to be established [ 15 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We previously reported that virulent representatives of M1T1 GAS , with the phenotype SpeBhi/SpeA-/Sda1low , irreversibly switch to the hypervirulent SpeB-/SpeA+/Sda1high phenotype after > / = 3 days in vivo [ 12 ] , [ 16 ] and that the parent phenotype vanishes by day 7 post-infection [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Subsequent studies uncovered that this genetic switch is driven by host innate immune pressure that selects for bacteria with pathoadaptive mutations in the covRS genetic locus [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">CovRS is a two-component regulatory system , in which CovS transduces external signals [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] to CovR , which in turn represses the transcription of several group A streptococcal ( GAS ) virulence gene sets , including the capsule synthesis operon ( hasABC ) , the streptolysin S operon ( SLS or sagA-H ) , and the streptokinase gene ( ska ) [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">CovR regulatory activity is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be triggered when the protein is phosphorylated at D53 [ 21 ] , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> by acetyl phosphate [ 22 ] , [ 23</scope> ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">On the other hand , under stress conditions , CovS dephosphorylates CovR and reverses virulence gene repression [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Mutations in covS are thus expected to affect CovR phosphorylation status differentially in vitro and in vivo ( under stress conditions ) , and to consequently modulate CovRS signaling-regulation circuits in a complex manner that remains largely unexplored .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This complexity is further magnified by the reported strain-specific differences in the impact of CovS on pathogenesis [ 24 ] , by the finding that phosphorylated CovR has different affinities to different streptococcal promoters [ 21 ] , and by the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibility</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="3"> CovR promoter binding <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be modulated by kinases or phosphatases other than CovS [ 25</scope></scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In fact , CovR retains some of its functions in the <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">absence</cue> of wild type CovS</scope> [ 26 ] , and different covS mutations , albeit clustered in its histidine kinase domain , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">might</cue> have different effects on expression of CovR-regulated genes [ 27 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In accordance with these biochemical findings , we and others have reported that some covS mutations generate hypervirulent isolates associated with invasive forms of streptococcal infection [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 28 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease , SpeB , which remodels the host-pathogen interface [ 29 ] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [ 12 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] as well as host proteins [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Consequently , absence of a proteolytically active SpeB preserves several virulence factors that it normally degrades [ 12 ] , [ 35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">One of these preserved factors is the highly potent DNase , Sda1 , which destroys neutrophil extracellular traps , NETs [ 36 ] , protecting the bacteria from neutrophil killing , promoting bacterial invasion , and facilitating human plasminogen-mediated bacterial dissemination into normally sterile sites , which results in invasive infections [ 14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Despite the association between covS mutations and the emergence of the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains , it is <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">unclear</cue> <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">whether</cue> this increased virulence <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">can</cue> be entirely attributed to the modulation of the CovR regulon or if other networks are also perturbed in vivo directly , indirectly , or independently of the CovRS system</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Additionally , the effects of covS mutations on bacterial niche adaptability are still undetermined because the in vivo transcriptomes of the wild type ( WT ) and animal-passaged ( AP ) bacteria have <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> been compared under the same experimental conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">To address these issues and improve our understanding of the gene regulatory impact of mutational and adaptive events contributing to the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains , we analyzed differences in growth requirements , transcriptome profiles , and regulatory circuits of the virulent ( WT ) and hypervirulent ( AP ) phenotypes of the M1T1 strain both in vitro and during initial in vivo infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Such comprehensive analyses highlighted the behavior of genomic subsystems that <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> be involved <scope type="spec" id="11"> directly <cue type="spec" id="11">or</cue> indirectly</scope> in S. pyogenes niche adaptation and pathogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">In addition , this approach offered a rare transcriptional snapshot of the SpeBhi/SpeA-/Sda1low population prior to its extinction in vivo .</sentence>
