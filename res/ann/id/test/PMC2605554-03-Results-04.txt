SpeB-positive bacteria revert to a SpeB-negative phenotype on subcutaneous infection 
C57BL6/J mice were subcutaneously infected with the SpeB-positive strain 5628R+. Three days post-infection, bacteria were recovered from the lesion and screened for SpeB status using the skim-milk agar method. While the inoculum was 100% SpeB-positive, bacterial populations recovered from the lesions of individual mice were found to be 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 24% SpeB-negative. Five representative colonies were picked, and the covR/S locus was sequenced in each of them. All colonies sequenced were found to have substitution mutations in covR/S resulting in truncation of CovS. This finding reveals that when SpeB-negative colonies are selected for in vivo, this selection is predominantly a phenomenon associated with CovR/S inactivation. The ropB mutation of strain 5628 was not recapitulated on passage in the mouse subcutaneous infection model.
