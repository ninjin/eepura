<sentence id="11">In bacteria , Fur down-regulates the transcription of genes involved in iron-acquisition and iron homeostasis in bacterial cells , and its action is directly linked to the amount of available iron , as it requires Fe2+ as a cofactor [ 41 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="13">Iron restriction if often <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">thought</cue> to be an important signal for bacteria</scope> , and has often been linked with the expression of virulence factors such as toxins [ 42 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="16">However , a few genes involved in iron acquisition , namely APL_0096 , APL_0668 , hbpA and irp , were up-regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Since <scope type="neg" id="16">these genes were <cue type="neg" id="16">not</cue> identified in a previous transcript profiling experiment under iron-restricted conditions [ 28</scope> ] , this <scope type="spec" id="18"> <cue type="spec" id="18">might</cue> <scope type="spec" id="19"> <cue type="spec" id="19">imply</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="17">they are <cue type="neg" id="17">not</cue> regulated by Fur</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">The hfq gene , which codes for a protein involved in RNA molecule stability and RNA-RNA interactions [ 43 ] and that therefore has an important regulatory function , was also down-regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Hfq is an RNA chaperone that acts as a post-transcriptional riboregulator [ 44 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">The role of Hfq , a Sm-like protein , has been investigated with greater interest over the last decade since it was shown that it is involved in the function of small RNAs ( sRNAs ) [ 45 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="25">Down-regulation of cpxABC , involved in capsule biosynthesis , has also been observed during planktonic life in liquid medium in contact with porcine lung epithelial cells [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">The down-regulation of genes involved in capsule synthesis could <scope type="spec" id="22"> <cue type="spec" id="22">potentially</cue> lead to the production of a thinner capsule on the surface of bacteria , thereby unmasking potential adhesins</scope> .</sentence>
