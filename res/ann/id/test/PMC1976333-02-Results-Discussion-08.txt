yhjH Affects Flagellar Motor Bias 
Mutations in yhjH were recently found to impair swimming motility [42]. Consistent with this, we found that insertions in yhjH exhibit a high average z-score of +277 in our enrichment for nonmotile mutants. Surprisingly, this gene showed a negative z-score of -8 after bacteriophage chi selection, indicating that this mutant is impaired in swimming motility but may show increased susceptibility to chi-phage infection relative to the wild-type strain. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that this mutant has flagella with an extreme CCW rotation bias, a phenotype also exhibited, to varying degrees, by cheA, cheR, and cheW mutants [43]. To further characterize the effect of this mutation on motility, an in-frame deletion of yhjH was constructed. Electron microscopy of DeltayhjH mutants showed the appearance of flagella, and light microscopy showed vigorous cellular movement (unpublished data), indicating that the flagella are capable of rotating; still, this mutant exhibited severe impairment in swimming (Figure 1C). To determine whether the absence of yhjH alters the direction of flagellar rotation, several functional studies were performed. First, chi-phage infectivity assays with DeltayhjH mutants showed comparable levels of infection to cheR mutants (which exhibit CCW flagellar rotation bias) in contrast to the reduced sensitivity displayed by cheZ mutants (which have CW flagellar rotation bias), consistent with the z-scores of our chi-phage selection (Figure 5E). Second, while DeltayhjH mutants are impaired in swimming motility, they did not show a measurable defect in swarming (Figure 6A), which is in agreement with our finding that flagellar motor switching is not critical for swarming. In a final functional test, individual cells of four different strains-wild-type cells and mutants with yhjH, cheR, and cheZ deletions-were tethered to a microscope slide and the frequency of flagellar rotation switching was measured using computer tracking software in a fashion similar to Block et al. [44]. These measurements revealed that indeed the flagella of DeltayhjH mutants, while not strictly locked in one direction of rotation, exhibit a strong CCW bias with a rotational switching frequency intermediate between that found in wild-type cells and in DeltacheR mutants (Figure 6B). This finding is consistent with the chi-phage selection results. Tether assays with DeltayhjH DeltacheZ double mutants showed flagellar rotation indistinguishable from cheZ single mutants (unpublished data), indicating that null mutations in cheZ are epistatic to null mutations in yhjH. Together, these results indicate that the yhjH gene product is involved with the frequency of flagellar motor switching, a process that is among the remaining puzzles in bacterial chemotaxis [45].
