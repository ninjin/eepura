Propanediol utilization operon 
The cob operon is required for the de novo biosynthesis of vitamin B12 in Salmonella Typhimurium. Propanediol, derived from rhamnose and fucose catabolism, is degraded by products of the propanediol utilization (pdu) operon (immediately adjacent to the cob operon) in a vitamin B12 dependent manner. This allows Salmonella Typhimurium to grow using propanediol as a sole carbon source and because it is required for growth in macrophages this may be the preferred intracellular metabolite [47]. Results from our proteomics analysis revealed that Hfq regulates the cob-pdu operon in AMM-2 (Figure 4A) and stationary phase (Figure 4D) growth conditions, with several products of the cob-pdu operon exhibiting increased expression compared to wild type. Among these were PduA, PduB, PduG, PduL, PduM and PduT as well as CobT, CbiH, CbiF, CbiC, and CbiL. This was not apparent in the DeltasmpB mutant strain in which cob-pdu protein levels are the same as the parent (Figure 4A and 4D). Western blot analysis of PduA and PduE relative protein levels validated results from the proteomics analysis (Figures 4B, 4C and 4E, 4F). The strong regulation of Pdu protein expression by Hfq suggests the pdu operon to be a potential target of sRNA regulation and that correct coordinate expression may be essential for activity. Both microarray analysis and confirmative qRT-PCR assays showed that RNA levels were unchanged for pduA and pduE genes in the Deltahfq mutant strain compared to the wildtype strain (Figure 5), thus showing that Hfq represses translation in these two environmental conditions. The data presented here suggests Hfq likely plays a substantial role in the regulation of the protein expression of the cob-pdu operon, required for intra-macrophage replication [47], via post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.
