<sentence id="0">Transcriptional profiling of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae during the acute phase of a natural infection in pigs</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia , a respiratory disease which causes great economic losses worldwide .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Many virulence factors are involved in the pathogenesis , namely capsular polysaccharides , RTX toxins , LPS and many iron acquisition systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to identify genes that are expressed in vivo during a natural infection , we undertook transcript profiling experiments with an A. pleuropneumoniae DNA microarray , after recovery of bacterial mRNAs from serotype 5b-infected porcine lungs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">AppChip2 contains 2033 PCR amplicons based on the genomic sequence of App serotype 5b strain L20 , representing more than 95 % of ORFs greater than 160 bp in length .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Results Transcriptional profiling of A. pleuropneumoniae recovered from the lung of a pig suffering from a natural infection or following growth of the bacterial isolate in BHI medium was performed .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">An RNA extraction protocol combining beadbeating and hot-acid-phenol was developed in order to maximize bacterial mRNA yields and quality following total RNA extraction from lung lesions .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Nearly all A. pleuropneumoniae transcripts could be detected on our microarrays , and 150 genes were deemed differentially expressed in vivo during the acute phase of the infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> , for example , gene apxIVA from an operon coding for RTX toxin ApxIV is highly up-regulated in vivo</scope> , and that two genes from the operon coding for type IV fimbriae ( APL_0878 and APL_0879 ) were also up-regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These transcriptional profiling data , combined with previous comparative genomic hybridizations performed by our group , revealed that 66 out of the 72 up-regulated genes are conserved amongst all serotypes and that 3 of them code for products that are predicted outer membrane proteins ( genes irp and APL_0959 , predicted to code for a TonB-dependent receptor and a filamentous hemagglutinin/adhesin respectively ) or lipoproteins ( gene APL_0920 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Only 4 of 72 up-regulated genes had previously been identified in controled experimental infections .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Conclusions These genes that we have identified as up-regulated in vivo , conserved across serotypes and coding for potential outer membrane proteins represent potential candidates for the development of a cross-protective vaccine against porcine pleuropneumonia .</sentence>
