An occurrence of bac gene, sak188, sak189 TCS genes and erythromycin resistance among S. agalactiae strains A total of 239 S. agalactiae strains isolated from human and animals were studied. The strains were tested by PCR for the presence of virulence gene bac and sak188 and sak189 TCS genes, which were previously found to be located on pathogenicity island [13]. As result, 53 strains isolated from pregnant women and 5 strains isolated from the cow's milk were found to be bac gene positive. They were selected for further study. PCR analysis of the bac gene positive strains revealed that the presence of bac gene correlated with the presence of sensor histidine kinase gene sak188 and DNA-binding response regulator gene sak189 (data not shown). Genomic architecture of DNA fragments containing sak188, sak189 and bac genes in S. agalactiae [13], [14], and rr06, hk06 and cbpA genes in S. pneumoniae [22] is presented in the Fig. 1. For the purpose of insertional inactivation, the vector pVA891-2 that provides erythromycin (Em) resistance was used. Thus, the strains were additionally screened for sensitivity to Em. As result, most of human bac gene positive strains showed resistance or intermediate resistance to Em in the standard diffusion disk test, that is in agreement with previous observations demonstrating an increase in Em resistance in S. agalactiae population [30], [31]. One of the strains, 168/00, which demonstrated the large diameter of growth inhibition zone, was selected for further study. In this strain, the bac gene has unique allele with the closest similarity with 676a and 676b alleles according to classification of Kong et al. [32].
