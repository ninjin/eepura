P. entomophila Virulence Is Multi-Factorial 
In agreement with previous studies, we show that aprA expression in P. entomophila depends on both PrtR and the GacS/GacA system. The GacS/GacA two-component regulatory system is conserved in numerous Gram-negative bacteria and has been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular functions and virulence factors [30,31]. Our study indicates that it is the master regulator of P. entomophila virulence. In a gacA mutant background, AprA synthesis is not restored when a plasmid with the aprA locus is expressed in trans (unpublished data), which is in agreement with post-transcriptional regulation of aprA by gacA via the two small non-coding RNAs RsmY and RsmZ [11]. As opposed to the pleiotropic effects of GacS/GacA, PrtR appears to be a more specific regulator of aprA expression in P. entomophila, reminiscent of aprX regulation in P. fluorescens [32]. Many pseudomonads and other bacteria express proteases similar to AprA but are not able to infect Drosophila by oral ingestion. This indicates that AprA is not the sole virulence factor required for persistence in the Drosophila gastrointestinal tract. The difference in pathogenicity exhibited by gacA, prtR, and aprA mutants underlines the complexity of P. entomophila virulence factors. The observation that both aprA and prtR, but not gacA, mutants retained the capacity to trigger a systemic immune response indicates a clear distinction between pathogenicity and immune activation. Our current hypothesis is that systemic immune activation is linked to bacterial persistence in the gut and release of peptidoglycan fragments small enough to cross the gut barrier [33]. Our results indicate that the GacS/GacA two-component system regulates one or several genes that promote bacterial survival in the gut. This hypothesized persistence-promoting factor may have a function similar to the Erwinia virulence factor (evf) gene of E. carotovora Ecc15 that promotes persistence of Gram-negative bacteria in the larval gut [34]. Since gacA mutants did not persist in imd-deficient mutant hosts, we speculate that this persistence-promoting factor provides general protection against gut intestinal conditions rather than a specific protection against the fly immune response. Another interesting feature of P. entomophila virulence is the food-uptake cessation which is observed in prtR and aprA but not in gacA mutants. Food-uptake cessation or blockage in insects is induced by several other entomopathogenic bacteria including S. entomophila and Yersinia pestis, enabling persistence in the digestive tract of their insect hosts [35,36]. This observation suggests that peristaltic movements of the gut may also play an important role in the elimination of bacteria, and that entomopathogens have developed strategies to abrogate these movements. In S. entomophila, it has been shown that genes encoded by a prophage were responsible for the anti-feeding reaction in its natural insect host, the grass grub Costelytra zealandica larvae [35]. Y. pestis is able to multiply in the flea midgut and forms cohesive aggregates. The absence of homologous genes to these factors in P. entomophila indicates that other factors are probably implicated in this bacterium [10]. Determining the cause of this food-uptake cessation and its possible link to the persistence-promoting factor will be essential for the elucidation of the initial events involved in gut colonization. Finally, our study shows that aprA, but not gacA, mutants of P. entomophila retain a moderate capacity to kill both adult flies and larvae. This confirms the existence of other bacterial virulence factors. The genome of P. entomophila contains several genes encoding putative insecticidal toxins (e.g., Tc toxins, hemolysins, and lipopeptides). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether the strategies developed by P. entomophila to persist in the larval gut and to kill its host involves genes related to those identified in other entomopathogenic bacteria and how the different factors contribute to pathogenesis.
