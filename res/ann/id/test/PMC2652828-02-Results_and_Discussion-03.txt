Deltahfq and DeltasmpB Salmonella Typhimurium mutant strains show defects in intra-macrophage proliferation 
As Salmonella's ability to replicate within macrophages is essential for its virulence [29], we examined intracellular replication of Deltahfq and DeltasmpB Salmonella Typhimurium mutant strains within the macrophage- like cell line RAW264.7. These cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of about 1 bacteria per cell with stationary phase bacteria grown overnight in LB broth as described in Materials and Methods. Extracellular bacteria were removed by washing and treatment with gentamicin. After infection the cells were lysed at various times by rapid resuspension in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Intracellular survival/replication results (Figure 2) are consistent with earlier reports that suggest Deltahfq and DeltasmpB Salmonella Typhimurium mutant strains are essential for intra-macrophage proliferation [22], [23], [25].
