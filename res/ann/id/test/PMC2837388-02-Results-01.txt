Transcriptional profiling of an ssrB mutant To begin to understand regulatory evolution and network expansion of the SsrB response regulator, we profiled the transcriptome of an ssrB mutant and compared it to S. Typhimurium wild-type cells grown in an acidic minimal medium that activates the SsrA-SsrB two-component regulatory system [20]. We identified 133 genes that were significantly down-regulated in the ssrB mutant [z <-1.96] [21] (Table 1). This included almost all genes in the SPI-2 genomic island as well as effector genes encoded throughout the genome (Dataset S1). Next, we performed a Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) analysis [22] on the 118 genes that had an ortholog in the annotated genome of S. Typhimurium strain LT2 [23]. Among these, 45 genes lacked a functional COG assignment and the 73 remaining genes were distributed among 86 COGs (Figure 1). The majority of functions in the latter groups are in transport, secretion, and trafficking of cellular components in addition to protein and membrane modification. The SsrA-SsrB system was acquired by horizontal gene transfer into the S. enterica species after divergence from what is now extant S. bongori. As such, S. bongori has evolved in the absence of SsrA-SsrB and its regulatory architecture has not been influenced by it. Orthologous genes ancestral to both species but regulated by SsrB in S. enterica provide evidence for network expansion and regulatory evolution that we previously showed can be mapped to a single cis-input location by using functional and comparative genomics [19]. To expand on this, we used a reciprocal BLAST-based analysis and identified 47 orthologs in S. bongori among the 133 genes whose transcription was down-regulated in an ssrB mutant (Table 1). In DeltassrB cells, the mean fold-change of the orthologous genes (-6.1-fold) was subtler than for the S. enterica-specific gene set (mean -21.2-fold), which included the T3SS and associated effector genes (Dataset S1). We also determined the distribution of down-regulated genes among genomic islands [24], including prophages, pathogenicity islands (SPI-islands) and additional regions of difference (ROD) between S. enterica and S. bongori (Dataset S2). For this we used a BLAST-based comparison of genome-wide synteny between S. Typhimurium and S. bongori and identified 50 ROD that included 17 previously reported SPI-islands and prophages. Of the 133 down-regulated genes identified, 56 were present within genomic islands (Table 1), with a mean change in gene expression of -25.3-fold in DeltassrB cells.
