Genes with unknown function 
Ten genes encoding products with unknown functions were identified to be upregulated in both bacteria during infection of R. majalis. These include two P. temperata and three X. koppenhoeferi genes which show sequence similarity to genes encoding hypothetical proteins with unknown functions, and two P. temperata and three X. koppenhoeferi sequences that exhibit no similarity to any gene or gene product in current databases. These unknown genes may represent novel pathogenicity factors used by bacteria during insect infection and thus require further investigation.
