Mapping Phenotype to Genotype Using Microarray-Based Genetic Footprinting Traditional methods of genetic investigation have been extremely successful in providing a deep molecular understanding of many phenotypes in model microorganisms. However, faced with literally thousands of important and mostly uncharacterized bacterial species, we need entirely novel methods of genetic functional analysis and pathway elucidation that scale to the task at hand. In this study, we have applied a systematic genome-wide strategy to determine the contribution of nearly all genetic loci in the genome to a phenotype of interest. Our approach combines genetic footprinting [13] with microarray hybridization [14] in order to monitor, in parallel, the relative abundances of transposon-mutagenized cells throughout a competitive selection experiment [12]. Saturation transposon mutagenesis is a powerful, versatile, and efficient strategy for creating comprehensive mutant libraries for genomic functional characterization [15]. We have used a hyperactive Tn5 transposition system with reduced target specificity [16] to create a library of approximately 5 x 105 independent transposon insertional mutants in E. coli MG1655. Given the reduced target specificity and a genome of approximately 4,300 genes, the mutagenesis of our library is saturating with an average of approximately100 independent insertions within each open reading frame (ORF). In each of our experiments, a population of mutants is challenged for competitive growth under a selection of interest. Each mutant within the population is uniquely defined by the local sequence flanking the transposon insertion site. The series of molecular manipulations detailed in Figure S1 allow the amplification of roughly 200 base pairs flanking each transposon insertion site in a population in parallel. Fluorescent labeling and hybridization of the amplicons to a spotted DNA microarray (created as described in Protocol S1) reveal the relative abundance of each mutant as reflected by the signal intensity of the corresponding ORF on the array. As a consequence of selection, individual insertional mutants can increase or decrease in abundance during the course of an experiment, and these relative changes can be monitored by comparing genome-wide hybridization values before and after selection. In a proof-of-principle analysis of the unselected transposon library, we show that the hybridization intensities corresponding to known essential genes are strongly biased towards the lowest values, consistent with their inability to harbor transposon insertions (Figure S2).
