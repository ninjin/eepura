<sentence id="11">When compared with OG1RF , transposon mutants [ 12 ] in the OG1RF equivalent of EF2045 ( encoding the comGB homologue ) and in the OG1RF equivalent of EF1986 ( encoding the comGF homologue ) showed similar levels of transformability by electroporation <scope type="neg" id="8">( data <cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> shown )</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">implying</cue> that the difference in electroporation efficiency observed between OG1RF and V583 is <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> related to this locus</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In Streptococcus pneumoniae [ 50 ] , the competence operon is tightly regulated by a quorum sensing two-component system ( ComDE ) and a competence-stimulating peptide ( CSP ; encoded by comC ) .</sentence>
