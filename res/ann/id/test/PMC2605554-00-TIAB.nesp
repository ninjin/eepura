<sentence id="0">A Naturally Occurring Mutation in ropB Suppresses SpeB Expression and Reduces M1T1 Group A Streptococcal Systemic Virulence</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epidemiological studies of group A streptococcus ( GAS ) have noted an inverse relationship between SpeB expression and invasive disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the role of SpeB in the course of infection is still <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study we utilize a SpeB-negative M1T1 clinical isolate , 5628 , with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB , to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Allelic exchange mutagenesis was used to replace the mutated ropB allele in 5628 with the intact allele from the well characterized isolate 5448 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The inverse allelic exchange was also performed to replace the intact ropB in 5448 with the mutated allele from 5628 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">An intact ropB was found to be essential for SpeB expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">While the ropB mutation was shown to have <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on hemolysis of RBC 's</scope> , extracellular DNase activity or survival in the presence of neutrophils , strains with the mutated ropB allele were less virulent in murine systemic models of infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">An isogenic SpeB knockout strain containing an intact RopB showed similarly reduced virulence .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Microarray analysis found genes of the SpeB operon to be the primary target of RopB regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These data show that an intact RopB and efficient SpeB production are necessary for systemic infection with GAS .</sentence>
