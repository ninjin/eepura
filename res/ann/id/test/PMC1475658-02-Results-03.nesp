<sentence id="0">The aprA Mutant Retains the Capacity to Trigger an Immune Response and to Induce Food-Uptake Cessation</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In addition to its pathogenicity , P. entomophila infection provokes a food-uptake cessation in larvae and triggers an immune response in both larvae and adults [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Feeding of larvae with medium containing bromophenol blue , leads to a clearly visible food uptake , discernable by blue coloration throughout the gut .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast , P. entomophila-infected larvae show only a pale blue coloration <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> infected larvae cease to ingest food</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Whereas this food-uptake cessation was still observed in aprA and prtR mutants , it was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> evident in gacA mutant-infected larvae ( Figure 2D <scope type="neg" id="2">and data <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> shown for prtR )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The kinetics of the expression of the AMP , Diptericin , in larvae and adults after natural infection by P. entomophila and its derivative mutants , was analyzed by real time quantitative PCR ( RT-qPCR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Diptericin was expressed at a wild-type level following oral infection with the aprA and prtR mutants , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> expression</scope> was detected in the case of the gacA mutant ( Figures 2C and 5A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Observation of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fluorescence in infected larvae carrying a Diptericin-GFP reporter gene confirmed that prtR and aprA mutants elicited an immune response , whereas gacA mutants <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">failed</cue> to do so ( unpublished data )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The data presented above clearly <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> AprA is a major virulence factor of P. entomophila that promotes bacterial persistence and killing of the host , but that other virulence factors controlled by gacA and prtR exist</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">It also reveals that P. entomophila virulence is multi-factorial with a clear distinction between factors that promote pathogenicity and those that trigger the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The observation that both factors are under the control of the GacS/GacA , confirmed that this two-component system is the master regulator of P. entomophila virulence .</sentence>
