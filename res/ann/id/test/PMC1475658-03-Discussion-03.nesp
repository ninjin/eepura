<sentence id="0">P. entomophila Virulence Is Multi-Factorial</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In agreement with previous studies , we show that aprA expression in P. entomophila depends on both PrtR and the GacS/GacA system .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The GacS/GacA two-component regulatory system is conserved in numerous Gram-negative bacteria and has been shown to regulate a wide variety of cellular functions and virulence factors [ 30,31 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="4">In a gacA mutant background , <scope type="neg" id="1">AprA synthesis is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> restored when a plasmid with the aprA locus is expressed in trans</scope> ( unpublished data ) , which is in agreement with post-transcriptional regulation of aprA by gacA via the two small non-coding RNAs RsmY and RsmZ [ 11 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">As opposed to the pleiotropic effects of GacS/GacA , <scope type="spec" id="2"> PrtR <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to be a more specific regulator of aprA expression in P. entomophila , reminiscent of aprX regulation in P. fluorescens [ 32 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Many pseudomonads and other bacteria express proteases similar to AprA but are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> able to infect Drosophila by oral ingestion</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicates that</cue> AprA is not the sole virulence factor required for persistence in the Drosophila gastrointestinal tract</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The difference in pathogenicity exhibited by gacA , prtR , and aprA mutants underlines the complexity of P. entomophila virulence factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The observation that both aprA and prtR , but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> gacA</scope> , mutants retained the capacity to trigger a systemic immune response <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicates</cue> a clear distinction between pathogenicity and immune activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our current hypothesis is that systemic immune activation is linked to bacterial persistence in the gut and release of peptidoglycan fragments small enough to cross the gut barrier [ 33 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Our results <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicate that</cue> the GacS/GacA two-component system regulates one or several genes that promote bacterial survival in the gut</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">hypothesized</cue> persistence-promoting factor <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> have a function similar to the Erwinia virulence factor ( evf ) gene of E. carotovora Ecc15 that promotes persistence of Gram-negative bacteria in the larval gut [ 34 ]</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Since gacA mutants did <scope type="neg" id="10"><cue type="neg" id="10">not</cue> persist in imd-deficient mutant hosts</scope> , we <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">speculate</cue> that this persistence-promoting factor provides general protection against gut intestinal conditions <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">rather than</cue> a specific protection against the fly immune response</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Another interesting feature of P. entomophila virulence is the food-uptake cessation which is observed in prtR and aprA but <scope type="neg" id="13"><cue type="neg" id="13">not</cue> in gacA mutants</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Food-uptake cessation or blockage in insects is induced by several other entomopathogenic bacteria including S. entomophila and Yersinia pestis , enabling persistence in the digestive tract of their insect hosts [ 35,36 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">This observation <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">suggests</cue> that peristaltic movements of the gut <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">may</cue> also play an important role in the elimination of bacteria</scope> , and that entomopathogens have developed strategies to abrogate these movements</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In S. entomophila , it has been shown that genes encoded by a prophage were responsible for the anti-feeding reaction in its natural insect host , the grass grub Costelytra zealandica larvae [ 35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Y. pestis is able to multiply in the flea midgut and forms cohesive aggregates .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">The absence of homologous genes to these factors in P. entomophila <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">indicates that</cue> <scope type="spec" id="17"> other factors are <cue type="spec" id="17">probably</cue> implicated in this bacterium [ 10</scope> ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Determining the cause of this food-uptake cessation and its <scope type="spec" id="18"> <cue type="spec" id="18">possible</cue> link to the persistence-promoting factor will be essential for the elucidation of the initial events involved in gut colonization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Finally , our study shows that aprA , but <scope type="neg" id="19"><cue type="neg" id="19">not</cue> gacA</scope> , mutants of P. entomophila retain a moderate capacity to kill both adult flies and larvae .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">This confirms the existence of other bacterial virulence factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">The genome of P. entomophila contains several genes encoding <scope type="spec" id="20"> <cue type="spec" id="20">putative</cue> insecticidal toxins</scope> ( e.g. , Tc toxins , hemolysins , and lipopeptides ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">Therefore , it remains to be determined <scope type="spec" id="21"> <cue type="spec" id="21">whether</cue> the strategies developed by P. entomophila to persist in the larval gut</scope> and to kill its host involves genes related to those identified in other entomopathogenic bacteria and how the different factors contribute to pathogenesis .</sentence>
