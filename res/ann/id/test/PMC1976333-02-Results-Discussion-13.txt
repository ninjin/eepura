Conclusions and Summary 
Microbes account for half the world's biomass and are the most widely distributed organisms on the planet. Yet most of our genetic understanding of bacterial behavior comes from the tiny fraction of microbes studied in the laboratory. With the recent advances in bacterial whole-genome sequencing [68,69], the scientific community is poised to take systems-level experimental approaches to rapidly reveal novel and fundamental insights into the microbial world. In this study, we have established a powerful framework for the efficient and comprehensive identification of the genetic basis of complex bacterial behaviors. The power of this approach lies in the rapid and parallel manner in which positive and negative genetic contributions can be mapped to any phenotype after competitive selection. We demonstrated this approach in four distinct but complementary selections to reveal the genetic basis of E. coli motility. Using this framework, we identified greater than 95% of previously known flagellar and chemotaxis genes, and we found three dozen novel contributors to motility consisting of both characterized and uncharacterized genes. Although similar approaches have been successfully applied to the study of pathogenicity [70-74], the large number of genes reported and the limited analyses of individual mutants made it difficult to determine whether the methods employed in these studies could detect the subtle quantitative differences necessary to map genetic loci with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we confirmed our findings by functional analyses of individual mutants, which revealed high levels of sensitivity and low rates of false positives. In addition, we have shown that the same method can be used to quickly and thoroughly explore the genetic interactions between a single locus and all other genetic loci in the genome. These interactions correspond to important network-level concepts; for example, the flow of information within signal transduction pathways and second-messenger systems such as c-di-GMP. In addition to identifying gene-by-gene interactions, we have shown that the same framework can be used to reveal gene-by-environment interactions that are crucial for understanding function within the rich ecological context in which genetic networks have evolved.
