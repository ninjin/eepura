Genetic Basis of Swarming Motility 
Whereas flagellar-mediated swimming is among the best-understood bacterial behaviors, very little is known about the genetic program that leads to the development of swarming. Swarming is exhibited by many flagellated bacteria, and is defined as a coordinated multicellular migration across a solid surface by morphologically differentiated cells [28]. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows swarming cells aligning themselves lengthwise and moving coordinately in groups, forming "rafts" (Movie S1). In this context, the cells appear to execute smooth swimming behavior almost exclusively, in contrast to the extensive switching back and forth seen during chemotaxis. Aside from the requirement for flagella, other aspects of the behavior are poorly understood. Because the genetic basis of swarming is not well characterized, this behavior is well suited for comprehensive analysis using our approach. In order to explore the genetic basis of swarming, we expressed this phenotype in terms of a quantitative selection, much as was done for swimming motility. A single round of enrichment consisted of inoculating our library of E. coli mutants onto the center of agar plates, incubating the plates to allow the cells to migrate outward from the site of inoculation, and transferring bacteria from the original area of inoculation to a fresh plate. After twenty rounds of daily successive transfers (Figure 3A), more than 90% of the population exhibited a defect in swarming (Figure S5). The enriched mutants were then subjected to microarray-based genetic footprinting. As expected, the selection results were dominated by flagellar and chemotaxis genes (Figure 3B). While mutants with a defect in the flagellar apparatus did not swarm, chemotaxis mutants formed swarming patterns as finger-like projections, in contrast to the more uniform swarming patterns generated by the wild-type parent strain (Figure 3C). These observations indicate that the chemotaxis sensory system and flagellar switching have an effect on, but are not critical for, surface motility. Although this observation contradicts earlier studies on swarming in E. coli and S. enterica [29], more recent work has shown that chemotaxis mutants are capable of surface motility when the surface of the agar is sprayed with a fine mist of water [30], or when the agar concentration of the swarming media is reduced from 0.6% to 0.45% [31]. The microarray results (Datasets S7-S10) guided the interrogation of additional genes that may have a role in swarming. In addition to flagellar genes, we found other loci that also contribute to swarming motility (Table S1), which are discussed in more detail below.
