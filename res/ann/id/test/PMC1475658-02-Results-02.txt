The P. entomophila aprA Mutant Displays Attenuated Pathogenicity 
The experiments described above suggested that AprA plays an important in vivo role in P. entomophila virulence. To further test this hypothesis, we used a genetic approach by inactivating the aprA gene. Sequence analysis of the locus corresponding to aprA revealed a genetic organization characteristic of this class of Type I-secreted proteases [14]. The structural gene for the metalloprotease, aprA, is followed by a gene encoding its periplasmic inhibitor, aprI, and three genes encoding the Type I transporter, aprD, E, and F (Figure 2A). Studies in other bacteria have shown that AprD, E, and F participate in the elaboration of a Type I transporter required for AprA secretion to the external medium [17]. We inactivated the aprA gene by inserting a tetracycline resistance cassette by a double homologous recombination event. SDS-PAGE protein profiles of culture supernatants clearly demonstrated the absence of the 51-kDa band, and in vitro protease activity of the aprA mutant confirmed the concomitant absence of secreted protease activity (Figure 1C, lane 6, and 1F). To analyze the in vivo contribution of AprA to P. entomophila virulence, we performed a survival analysis of Drosophila larvae and adults after oral infection with various P. entomophila derivatives. Only 40% of the aprA-infected larvae succumbed within 3 days, while 70% of the larvae died after infection with wild-type P. entomophila, demonstrating that the aprA mutant was attenuated for virulence (Figure 2B). Similarly, the aprA mutant showed reduced pathogenicity after oral infection of adult flies (Figure S1). Using the same assay, both prtR and gacA mutants were almost avirulent toward Drosophila indicating that both genes regulate other virulence factors in addition to AprA (Figure 2B). We next compared persistence of wild-type P. entomophila and the aprA mutant by quantifying the number of bacteria in larvae and adults at different time points after infection. Whereas the wild-type P. entomophila titer remained high, aprA bacterial levels decreased significantly with time (Figure 3A, not shown for larvae). However, aprA gut persistence remained higher than that of gacA mutants. We could not exclude that the aprA mutant phenotype was due to polar effects of the insertion in the operon upon expression of apr I, D, E, and F. In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated for both Serratia marcescens and P. fluorescens that Type I transporters can be polyvalent and secrete different types of proteins such as proteases and lipases [18,19]. Complementation of the aprA mutant with the wild-type apr operon restored protease secretion and activity (Figure 1C, lane 7, and 1F) and resulted in a complete regain of function with respect to all virulence phenotypes (Figures 2B and S1). In contrast, no rescue was observed with a plasmid containing the full apr operon but carrying a non-polar mutation in aprA (Figures 2B and S1). These data confirmed that the protease AprA itself contributes to P. entomophila virulence.
