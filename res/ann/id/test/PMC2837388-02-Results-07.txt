Regulatory evolution of the SPI-2 T3SS effector repertoire 
The above results identified the conserved, yet flexible, palindrome sequence defining DNA recognition by SsrB. To examine the extent to which regulatory evolution has been selective for this genetic architecture, we created a position weight matrix (PWM) for the five strongest palindrome sites in SPI-2 and the orthologous sites in Sodalis SSR-3. We then searched for representative candidates of this motif in the S. Typhimurium genome using the simple scoring algorithm MotifLocator [45],[46]. This analysis recovered the motifs upstream of ssaB, ssaG, ssaM, and ssaR that were used to generate the PWM. The palindrome in the ssrA promoter was not used to create the PWM due to its weaker consensus in the left heptamer, however, it was recovered in the computational analysis in a second group of lower-scoring motifs (Figure 6A). We identified 24 palindromes co-occurring with ChIP-on-chip peaks upstream of 24 different SsrB-regulated genes or operons. Applying a stringent threshold to the output allowed us to identify two groups - genes with high-scoring upstream palindromes (ssaB, ssaG, ssaM, ssaR, sopD2, sifA, sifB, sseK2, sseK3, sseL, sseA', steC, and srcA) and those with medium-scoring palindromes (0.7-0.8 threshold; ssrA, STM1633, sseI, slrP sspH2, pipB, sseJ, pipB2, srfN, sseA and steB) (Figure 6A and Dataset S4) (sseA' denotes the SsrB palindrome sequence upstream of sseA that falls within the ssaE CDS, while sseA refers to the SsrB-footprinted IGR site with only one conserved heptamer defined in Figure 4C). Remarkably, this accounted for 17 of 22 SL1344 genome-encoded effectors translocated by the SPI-2-encoded T3SS (exceptions are chromosomal steA, gogB, and sseK, and plasmid-encoded spvB and spvC). These genes either lacked an upstream ChIP peak above our 3-standard deviation cut-off (sseK) or had such a peak but did not reach statistical significance in our transcriptional profiling experiments (steA, gogB). Our ChIP-on-chip data revealed three additional strong SsrB binding peaks within SPI-2: one in the IGR directly upstream of ssaR, a second within the CDS for ssaJ, and a third within the CDS for ssaE that would be predicted to influence transcription of the downstream effector/chaperone operon beginning with sseA. The analysis described above recovered SsrB palindrome sequences at the sseA' and ssaR locations prompting further validation of these sites. No palindrome was identified for the ssaJ interaction peak and so further characterization was not pursued. For the IGR palindrome upstream of ssaR, we tested both a chromosome-integrated transcriptional fusion and an autonomous episomal reporter. In wild-type cells these reporters were as active as other SPI-2 promoters, whereas promoter activity was abrogated in DeltassrB cells, implicating this IGR as a functional promoter for ssaR (Figure 6B and Figure S4). We next tested the function of the intragenic palindrome within ssaE (sseA'). For this, we constructed a single-copy transcriptional reporter that either contained (WT PsseA) or lacked (PsseA del) the single heptamer site in the sseA IGR and integrated this reporter into wild-type cells and mutants lacking either ssrB or the ssaE coding sequence that removed the high-scoring intragenic palindrome sseA'. These experiments showed that the sseA' sequence contributes approximately 75% of transcriptional output at the sseA promoter (Figure 6C), since deleting the single heptamer in the sseA IGR had little effect on transcriptional output in any of the strain backgrounds. These reporter data are in line with the respective binding scores for the ChIP-on-chip interaction peaks (Figure 3) and the sequence similarity for these elements with respect to the consensus palindrome (Figure 6A and Figure 4D). Together, these data provide compelling evidence for the identity of the DNA recognition element that has been selected through evolution to co-regulate an SsrB-dependent gene program involved in adaptation to a host.
