General genome features The complete circular chromosome of OG1RF was found to be 2,739,625 bp with an average G+C content of 37.8%. The complete OG1RF sequence was obtained using three independent techniques (Solexa, the 454, and Sanger sequencing technique) with a higher than classic coverage (more than 100 times), diminishing the likelihood of sequencing-related frameshifts, base errors and/or misassembly. A comparison of our assembly of the closed OG1RF genome with the restriction map of OG1RF published by Murray et al. [10] showed only minor variations (primarily an overestimation of 30 kb for the Sfi I fragment E, 540 kb versus 509 kb predicted from the sequence; Figure 1). We found 232 kb of OG1RF unique sequences distributed in 48 regions ranging from 101 bp to approximately 49 kb in length (Figure 1; Additional data file 1). Using the published DNA sequence of V583 as reference (NC_004668), OG1RF shares 2,474 ORFs as well as the 12 rRNA genes and 58 of 68 tRNA genes (Table 1). The 10 missing tRNA are localized in a region in V583 that has been replaced in OG1RF by a 49 kb region (see below). Surprisingly, the genomes align syntenically, as shown in Figure 2, despite the fact that 25% of the V583 genome is composed of mobile elements. Similarly, the presence of OG1RF-unique sequences has not affected the overall chromosomal arrangement. Some of the major insertions/deletions in the two genomes are shown in Figure 2, such as the absence of the pathogenicity island (PAI) in OG1RF and the presence of an approximately 49 kb fragment unique to OG1RF. However, most of the differences are small and cannot be visualized in this figure. Overall, we found 64 areas of divergence between the genomes that can be divided into 3 classes: an additional sequence present in OG1RF when compared with V583; a sequence replacement where a sequence in OG1RF differs from the sequence in V583; and the absence of a sequence from OG1RF when compared with V583.
