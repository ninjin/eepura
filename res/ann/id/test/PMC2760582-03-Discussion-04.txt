Genes involved in adaptation to host-induced stresses 
Compared to all other functional classes, more stress response genes were identified to be shared by P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, suggesting common themes in adaptation to host-imposed stresses. Upregulation of both surA and uspB in both bacteria indicates their importance in bacterial adaptation to global stress during insect infection. Gene surA is important for bacterial survival during infection [41,42] to avoid accumulation of non-native protein conformations [42-44], and uspB gene product is usually accumulated in the stationary phase and probably important for ethanol stress [45]. Similarly, induction of a chaperone protein encoding gene dnaK in both bacteria may picture common stress responses between P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi in a number of cellular processes including rescue of misfolded proteins and control of the activity of folded regulatory proteins [46]. The glutathione synthetase gene gshB which mediates condensation of gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine to form glutathione [47,48] was induced in P. temperata, but glutathione reductase gene gor which reduces glutathione disulfide to the sulfhydryl form of glutathione [47,48] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi. Glutathione plays a major role in protection against oxidative stress and in detoxification of hazardous chemicals or heavy metals [49]. Thus, although gshB and gor corresponding products are involved in different glutathione biosynthesis pathways, expression of these two genes may suggests possible role of detoxification mechanism in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of R. majalis. Further, as Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria can switch their phenotypes upon insect infection, we speculate that upregulation of transposase genes in both bacteria may contribute to genetic variability for better adaptation and survival in a particular niche [50]. Apart from the common mechanisms handling stresses, gene msrA encoding a peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase was unique to X. koppenhoeferi. As an important antioxidant enzyme, peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase mediates the repair of proteins damaged by sulfoxidation of methionine residues [51,52]. Products of msrA are found to interact with several other gene products (see Additional file 2), also suggesting its importance during insect infection.
