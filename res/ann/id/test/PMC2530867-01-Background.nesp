<sentence id="0">Background</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Enterococci have emerged over the past few decades as the second to third most common cause of nosocomial infections , including urinary tract and soft tissue infections , bacteremia , and endocarditis [ 1-3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">They are well equipped to thrive in environments with heavy antibiotic usage due to both their intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and their talent for swapping genetic information , which allows them to gain and share resistance determinants .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Entecococcal infections are predominantly caused by E. faecalis and E. faecium .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , many , if not most , strains of these species are harmless commensals , with some enterococci being marketed in Europe to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and recurrent chronic sinusitis or bronchitis ( Cylactin(R) and Fargo688(R) ( E. faecium ) and Symbioflor 1 ( E. faecalis ) ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To differentiate the two faces of this organism , genome-wide comparisons are necessary .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although hundreds of microbial genomes have been sequenced , only two E. faecalis genomes have been reported ( V583 as a clinical isolate [ 4 ] and Symbioflor 1 as a commensal isolate [ 5 ] ) , but only the V583 genome has been made publicly available .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In this strain , more than one-quarter of the genome is mobile DNA , more than any other sequenced bacterial genome [ 4 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance determinants in V583 [ 6 ] makes it difficult to manipulate genetically .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Moreover , the vancomycin resistance phenotype makes this strain more of a risk to handle in the laboratory .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">To avoid these issues , most laboratories use strain OG1 or its close derivatives .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">OG1 is a human isolate subsequently shown to cause dental caries in rats [ 7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">OG1RF is a rifampicin and fusidic acid resistant derivative of OG1 [ 8,9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , Murray et al. [ 10 ] estimated the size of the OG1RF genome as 2,825 kb and created a restriction map of the chromosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST ) showed that OG1RF is clonally distinct from V583 ( differs in six out of seven alleles of housekeeping genes ) [ 11 ] and characterization of regions flanking transposon insertions in OG1RF <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that approximately 10 % of their sequences differed [ 12</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">OG1 and its derivatives have been successfully used over the past 20 years in various animal models , starting with the demonstration that it can cause caries in germ-free rats [ 7 ] , and later to characterize factors important for E. faecalis virulence in a mouse model of peritonitis [ 13 ] , a rabbit model of endophthalmitis [ 14 ] , a rat model of endocarditis [ 15 ] and in a mouse urinary tract infection model [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">OG1RF was also shown to be as virulent as V583 in the model host Caenorhabditis elegans [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In addition to its virulence , the main reasons for the extensive use of OG1RF as a laboratory strain are that it does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> carry plasmids , is readily transformable by electroporation , and is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> resistant to commonly used antibiotics , other than rifampicin and fusidic acid</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">These resistances were serially selected in OG1 to provide strain markers [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">The lack of resistance to common antibiotics facilitates the selection of plasmids , transposons , and allelic replacement markers introduced into the strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Numerous factors important for virulence have been characterized in OG1RF .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">A recently described example are the Ebp pili , whose subunits are encoded by the ebp operon [ 18 ] and whose genes are regulated by EbpR [ 19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">A non-piliated mutant produces less biofilm than the parent strain and is attenuated in a rat model of endocarditis [ 18 ] and in a murine urinary tract infection model [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Also present is Ace , a member of the MSCRAMM ( microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules ) family .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">The ace gene , like the ebp locus , is ubiquitous in E. faecalis and it occurs in at least four different forms that vary in the number of repeats of the B domain [ 20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">Ace mediates conditional ( that is , after growth at 46degreesC or in the presence of serum or collagen ) adherence of E. faecalis to collagen type IV and to laminin [ 21 ] and , in unpublished data , influences the ability of OG1RF to cause experimental endocarditis ( KV Singh and BE Murray , unpublished observation ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">Finally , the Fsr system , a major positive and negative transcriptional regulator in OG1RF [ 22 ] , affects expression of several virulence factor genes , including gelE , which encodes gelatinase [ 23 ] , and contributes to infection in various animal models [ 15,24 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">The distinct MLST profile and the wide range of phenotypic and genotypic analyses of OG1RF , including many molecular genetic studies and experiments in various animal models , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> that genomic analysis of this strain <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">would</cue> prove insightful</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">would</cue> be useful to future studies</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">Thus , we analyzed the sequence of E. faecalis OG1RF .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">This revealed approximately 232 kb encoding 227 open reading frames ( ORFs ) that are unique to this important strain compared to V583 .</sentence>
<sentence id="30">The unique regions were then characterized further .</sentence>
