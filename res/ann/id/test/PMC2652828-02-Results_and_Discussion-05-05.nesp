<sentence id="0">Propanediol utilization operon</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The cob operon is required for the de novo biosynthesis of vitamin B12 in Salmonella Typhimurium .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Propanediol , derived from rhamnose and fucose catabolism , is degraded by products of the propanediol utilization ( pdu ) operon ( immediately adjacent to the cob operon ) in a vitamin B12 dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This allows Salmonella Typhimurium to grow using propanediol as a sole carbon source and because it is required for growth in macrophages this <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be the preferred intracellular metabolite [ 47</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Results from our proteomics analysis revealed that Hfq regulates the cob-pdu operon in AMM-2 ( Figure 4A ) and stationary phase ( Figure 4D ) growth conditions , with several products of the cob-pdu operon exhibiting increased expression compared to wild type .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Among these were PduA , PduB , PduG , PduL , PduM and PduT as well as CobT , CbiH , CbiF , CbiC , and CbiL .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> apparent in the DeltasmpB mutant strain</scope> in which cob-pdu protein levels are the same as the parent ( Figure 4A and 4D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Western blot analysis of PduA and PduE relative protein levels validated results from the proteomics analysis ( Figures 4B , 4C and 4E , 4F ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The strong regulation of Pdu protein expression by Hfq <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> the pdu operon to be a potential target of sRNA regulation and that correct coordinate expression <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be essential for activity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Both microarray analysis and confirmative qRT-PCR assays showed that RNA levels were unchanged for pduA and pduE genes in the Deltahfq mutant strain compared to the wildtype strain ( Figure 5 ) , thus showing that Hfq represses translation in these two environmental conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The data presented here <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> Hfq <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">likely</cue> plays a substantial role in the regulation of the protein expression of the cob-pdu operon</scope> , required for intra-macrophage replication [ 47 ] , via post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
