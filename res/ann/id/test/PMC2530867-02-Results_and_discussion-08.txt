An uninterrupted competence operon in OG1RF 
OG1RF contains what appears to be an intact competence operon while that of V583 appears to be non-functional. This operon in OG1RF is similar to a nine-gene operon described in Streptococcus mutans [47], as shown in Figure 6. For example, the homologue in OG1RF of EF2046 shares 61% similarity with ComYA and the OG1RF homologue of EF2045 is 55% similar to ComYB. In S. mutans, only the first seven genes of the operon are essential for competence [47]. In V583, the fourth gene of this operon (corresponding to OG1RF_0148) is interrupted by phage 4 (EF1896-EF2043); in addition, EF1984 contains a premature stop codon not found in the corresponding gene in OG1RF (OG1RF_0228). Natural competence has not been reported for E. faecalis. To assess the functionality of this operon in OG1RF, we evaluated the competence of cells in different phases of growth (early log growth to stationary phase) using pAM401 [48] and pMSP3535VA [49]. We were not able to show natural competence under the conditions tested. We have also noted that V583 is less transformable by electroporation than OG1RF. To investigate the possibility that directly or indirectly the com operon might be responsible for this phenotype, we also evaluated transformability by electroporation. When compared with OG1RF, transposon mutants [12] in the OG1RF equivalent of EF2045 (encoding the comGB homologue) and in the OG1RF equivalent of EF1986 (encoding the comGF homologue) showed similar levels of transformability by electroporation (data not shown), implying that the difference in electroporation efficiency observed between OG1RF and V583 is not related to this locus. In Streptococcus pneumoniae [50], the competence operon is tightly regulated by a quorum sensing two-component system (ComDE) and a competence-stimulating peptide (CSP; encoded by comC). We did not find any homologues of CSP in OG1RF. Two homologous ComDE sensor histidine kinase/response regulators were found in OG1RF, one of which is FsrC/FsrA. Based on our previous microarray data, the Fsr system does not regulate the comY operon, at least under our previously used conditions (mid-log phase growth to early stationary phase in brain heart infusion (BHI)) [22]. The other ComDE homology is that with a two-component system unique to OG1RF (OG1RF_0199 and OG1RF_0198, respectively) that lies on a 4,706 bp unique fragment that maps between EF3114 and EF3115 in V583. This fragment also carries two genes (OG1RF_0200 and OG1RF_0201) encoding homologues of the YhaQ and YhaP sodium efflux ATP-binding cassette efflux/transporter proteins (Figure 4b). Although they are potential elements of a secretion apparatus, these two proteins do not share any homology at the protein level with the competence secretion apparatus ComAB of S. pneumoniae [51] nor CslAB from S. mutans [52]. Searching for a possible CSP in the vicinity of these genes, we identified a small ORF encoding 50 amino acids between yhaP and OG1RF199 and another encoding 20 amino acids downstream of OG1RF198. More analysis will be required to determine if there are conditions in which the OG1RF com operon is expressed and to determine whether or not this two-component system is involved in competence.
