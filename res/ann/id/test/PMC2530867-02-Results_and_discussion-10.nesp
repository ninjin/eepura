<sentence id="0">Fusidic acid and rifampicin resistance</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OG1RF was sequentially selected from OG1 for resistance to fusidic acid and rifampicin [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mutation leading to rifampicin resistance was identified in the rpoB gene by Ozawa et al. [ 54 ] and is caused by the A1467G mutation , which results in substitution of arginine for histidine at amino acid 489 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The mutation also affected the clumping phenotype of traA mutants and <scope type="spec" id="0"> this effect <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be specific for the pAM373 system [ 54 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">All of the other 22 differences in rpoB between OG1RF and V583 are synonymous .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Fusidic acid resistance is associated with mutation(s) in the fusA gene , which encodes elongation factor G. We compared fusA from OG1RF with that in V583 and identified two differences ( C1368A and T1992C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The mutation T1992C is synonymous , while the mutation C1368A leads to the presence of glutamine ( histidine in V583 ) at position 404 in OG1RF .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Mutations in this region have been associated with fusidic acid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [ 55,56 ] , and thus the C1368A mutation is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> the cause of the fusidic acid resistance phenotype in OG1RF</scope> .</sentence>
