AprA Confers Protection against Diptericin 
We have shown that AprA protects P. entomophila against the Imd-regulated immune response. This immune pathway regulates the expression of several AMP genes, as well as many other immune genes. Previous studies indicated that Attacin A and Diptericin are the AMP genes most strongly induced in the gut following ingestion of infectious bacteria [7]. It has also been suggested that proteases homologous to AprA in other bacterial species degrade AMPs in vitro, thereby enabling pathogens to withstand the attack of the host immune system [20,21]. We confirmed that P. entomophila AprA rapidly degrades Cecropin A in vitro (unpublished data). To investigate a possible in vivo role of AprA in the protection against AMPs synthesized in the gut, we compared survival to P. entomophila in imd-deficient flies over-expressing Attacin A or Diptericin ubiquitously under the control of the daughterless Gal4 driver (daGal4) using the UAS-Gal4 system (referred to as imd; da>AMP, Figure S3B). This strategy allowed us to study the contribution of each antibacterial peptide to the defense against a P. entomophila infection. In a first set of experiments, we compared the survival rate of wild-type, imd, and imd; da>Dpt or AttA flies to natural infection with P. entomophila. Ubiquitous expression of Attacin A and Diptericin with the da-Gal4 driver greatly increased the resistance of imd mutant flies (Figure 6A). This experiment demonstrates that these AMPs can confer protection against P. entomophila and is in good agreement with a previous study showing that Attacin is the most potent AMP against Gram-negative bacteria [22]. Importantly, it also reveals for the first time a major contribution of Diptericin to host defense, which was not previously detected using systemic injection of microbes [22]. To investigate the in vivo relationship between AMP activity and microbial persistence we next compared the numbers of bacteria of wild-type P. entomophila and aprA mutants in imd fly lines over-expressing Diptericin. Figure 6B shows that the aprA mutant persisted less well than wild-type bacteria in imd flies over-expressing Diptericin. This result clearly indicates an in vivo action of AprA against Diptericin. No effect could be detected when Attacin A was over-expressed in agreement with the bacteriostatic mode of action of this AMP (unpublished data). Altogether, our results provide an in vivo demonstration that AprA functions in the protection of P. entomophila against Drosophila AMPs.
