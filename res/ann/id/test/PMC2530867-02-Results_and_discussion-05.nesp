<sentence id="0">Two-component regulatory systems</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OG1RF <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> four two-component systems found in V583</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These are histidine kinase-response regulator (HK-RR)08 , HK-RR12 located in the PAI , HK-RR16 and the vanB regulatory system HK-RR11 [ 38 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , an OG1RF-unique two-component system with high homology with the vanG locus was found at the location corresponding to the region between EF2860 and EF2861 in V583 ( Table 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">OG1RF_0193 shares 82 % similarity with VanRG and 81 % similarity with VanRG2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Similarly , OG1RF_0192 shares 68 % similarity with VanSG and VanSG2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A gene ( OG1RF_0191 ) encoding an M15 family muramoyl pentapeptide carboxypeptidase is located downstream of these two-component regulatory genes ( Figure 4a ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The predicted carboxypeptidase ( OG1RF_0191 ) shares 69 % similarity over 179 amino acids with EF2297 , a membrane-associated D , D-carboxypeptidase encoded by the vanB operon in V583 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , OG1RF_0191 <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> an identifiable transmembrane domain that is important to the VanY function</scope> and it is <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> , therefore , that this protein <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a soluble D</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="5"> D-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase as seen in Streptomyces [ 39 ] and Actinomadura [ 40 ] , and thus <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> be involved in peptidoglycan metabolism</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
