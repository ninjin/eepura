<sentence id="0">Introduction</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Precise gene regulation is crucial to the successful activation and execution of virulence programs for all pathogenic organisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The acquisition of genes through horizontal gene transfer , a widespread means of bacterial evolution [ 1 ] , requires a process to integrate new coding sequence into pre-existing regulatory circuitry .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Silencing of horizontally-acquired genes by DNA binding proteins like H-NS is one way some incoming genes are initially controlled [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , which can then be subject to regulatory evolution by mutating cis-regulatory operator regions to select for optional gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The eventual promoter architecture selected to deploy virulence genes is often modular and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">should</cue> reflect a design that maximizes organismal fitness while limiting fitness trade-offs and antagonistic pleiotropy [ 4</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both simulated [ 5 ] and functional experiments [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] show that mutation of cis-regulatory sequences can be rapid , and that plasticity - the degree to which regulatory mutation can perturb the larger gene network - can be well tolerated in bacterial systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Promoter architectures that control quantitative traits such as bacterial virulence are , in fact , modular and evolvable [ 8 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">For instance , Salmonella enterica has a multi-faceted pathogenic strategy fine-tuned by several transcriptional regulators .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Intracellular survival and persistence of Salmonella requires a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded in a horizontally-acquired genomic island called Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-2 ( SPI-2 ) [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">T3SS are complex secretion machines that deliver bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells through an injectisome during infection [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Several ancestral regulators control the genes in the SPI-2 genomic island including the two-component systems EnvZ-OmpR and PhoQ-PhoP , and the regulatory protein SlyA [ 13 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">SsrA-SsrB is another two-component regulatory system co-inherited by genetic linkage with the SPI-2 locus that is essential for gene expression in SPI-2 [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">SsrA is a sensor kinase activated in the host environment that phosphorylates the SsrB response regulator to create an active transcription factor needed for spatiotemporal control of virulence genes [ 13 ] , [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In the Salmonella genus , the SPI-2 genomic island is found only in pathogenic serotypes of Salmonella enterica that infect warm-blooded animals and is absent from Salmonella bongori , which colonizes cold-blooded animals [ 18 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">It is generally accepted that SPI-2 was acquired by Salmonella enterica after divergence from S. bongori , providing a useful pedigree to study regulatory evolution influenced by SsrB .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">We recently demonstrated the evolutionary significance of cis-regulatory mutations for pathoadaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) to an animal host [ 19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Our focus was on SsrB because of its broad conservation among the pathogenic Salmonellae and its essentiality for animal infection , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> it coordinates fundamental aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis beyond the SPI-2 genomic island</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In this study we investigated how regulatory evolution assimilates horizontally acquired and ancestral genes into the SsrB regulon on a genome-wide scale using an integrated set of experimental methods .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Combining our data with previous biochemical work , along with comparative genomic analyses with an orthologous T3SS-encoding genomic island in the tsetse fly endosymbiont , Sodalis glossinidius , we reveal the flexible DNA palindrome that distributes SsrB in the genome to influence transcriptional activation of the SPI-2 T3SS and almost all of its accessory effector proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Our data uncovers the principal SsrB circuitry <scope type="spec" id="2"> that <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to have been conserved to support multiple bacterial lifestyles , including parasitic and mutualist symbioses</scope> .</sentence>
