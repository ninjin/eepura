<sentence id="0">In vivo murine chamber infection model allows the dissection of regulatory vs. mutation-selection events</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several studies , including ours , have examined phenotypic , proteomic , and transcriptional differences between WT and animal-passaged M1T1 GAS strains [ For example , 11,12,13,16,26,27,37 ] , but none attempted to capture the dynamic changes in the bacterial population in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because bacteria recovered from animals and cultured in the laboratory are <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to have</scope> reprogrammed many regulatory networks to re-adapt to the in vitro growth conditions , transcriptome profiling of these bacteria <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> reflect their actual in vivo gene expression and regulation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we designed and performed in vivo passage experiments in which equal loads of in vitro-grown WT and AP bacteria were separately inoculated into murine subcutaneous chambers [ 16 ] and collected by needle aspiration after 24 h , a time sufficient for the bacteria to sense the host environment and transcriptionally respond to it , but not long enough to allow detectable restructuring of the bacterial community and selection of mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The concentrations of viable WT and AP bacteria at 24 h post-inoculation remained essentially the same : 1-5x109 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml vs. approximately2x109 CFU/ml inoculum .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We extracted RNA from these bacteria immediately after their recovery from mouse chambers with <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> additional culturing</scope> and used the extracted RNA for transcriptome profiling as detailed in Materials and Methods .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">For transcriptional profiling , we followed a cyclic , two-color design and performed 28 oligonucleotide microarray hybridization experiments representing technical and biological replicates of the four cell states under investigation : WT grown in vitro ( WT-vitro ) , WT grown in vivo ( WT-vivo ) , AP grown in vitro ( AP-vitro ) , and AP grown in vivo ( AP-vivo ) , Fig .</sentence>
