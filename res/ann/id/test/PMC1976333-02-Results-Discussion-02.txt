Quantitative Analysis of Selection within the Pool of Mutants 
To determine the degree to which each gene contributes to fitness under a particular selection, we quantify the extent of enrichment or depletion of all transposon insertions within a gene after a selection is imposed. We assign the total hybridization signal for each ORF on the array as the sum of contributions from all the mutants that harbor an insertion somewhere within or in close proximity to the ORF. The ORF intensities from five hybridizations of the maximally diverse unselected library (Dataset S1) are used as a statistical reference to quantify the degree of enrichment or depletion after the library is exposed to a selection of interest. In this way, the five unselected hybridizations define the null variation with respect to which significant differences are quantified. The normalized hybridization intensity value (x) of an ORF from a selection experiment is compared to the null distribution for that ORF (mean: <xn>, standard deviation: sigma), by calculating a z-score: z = (x - <xn>)/sigma. ORFs that harbor deleterious mutations during the selection will have negative z-scores (corresponding to depletion), whereas ORFs that harbor relatively favorable mutations during the selection will have positive z-scores (corresponding to enrichment). In other words, the z-score reflects the number of standard deviations above or below the mean of the unselected replicates.
