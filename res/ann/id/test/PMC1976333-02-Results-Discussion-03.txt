Genetic Basis of Swimming Motility and Chemotaxis 
Semi-solid tryptone agar provides a robust setting for studying E. coli chemotaxis. Once inoculated into a region of the soft agar, bacteria deplete local nutrients and chemotax radially outward following the concentration gradient of preferred substrates [17]. To systematically and completely identify the genetic determinants for swimming motility, approximately107 cells of the mutant library were functionally enriched en masse for an impaired ability to swim through soft agar. After an 8-h incubation to allow motile cells to swim away from the site of inoculation, the population enriched for nonmotile mutants was transferred to a fresh plate for further enrichment (Figure 1A). The percentage of nonmotile mutants was determined after each stage of enrichment by a clonal plating assay and, after five stages, 96% of the mutants showed an impaired ability to swim (Figure S3). The amplification of transposon insertion sites from a small sample of these mutants showed that the nonmotile phenotype is the result of a single gene disruption in each mutant. As expected, the vast majority of these disruptions occurred in previously known flagellar or chemotaxis genes (Table S3). However, even in this small sample, we found transposon insertions in genes without a previously known role in motility. To obtain a genome-wide catalog of loci involved in swimming motility, we applied our microarray-based genetic footprinting assay to the population of mutants at the end of the enrichments. The z-scores reveal that the vast majority of ORFs lie within a tight Gaussian-shaped distribution centered around zero (Figure 1B). However, of the 115 ORFs with z-scores greater than 12, 49 are known flagellar and chemotaxis genes. Since the microarray contained 52 out of the total of 54 known motility genes [18], the chance likelihood of observing this level of enrichment was extremely low (p < 10-76). The three remaining motility genes that were not significantly enriched are two chemoreceptor genes, trg and aer, and the filament cap chaperone, fliT. Based on the hybridization results, insertional mutations in these genes should not measurably impair motility. We confirmed this expectation by showing that deletions of fliT and aer did not affect motility (data not shown). The neutral behavior of the fliT mutation is not surprising since fliT null strains were found to make functional flagella in S. enterica [19]. In addition, it has been reported that fliT mutations enhance expression of class 2 flagellar operons [20] because FliT acts as a negative regulator of these operons by binding to and inhibiting the activity of FlhDC [21]. The protein encoded by aer mediates oxygen and redox sensing, and as such shares overlapping function with the Tsr receptor [22]. Because of this redundancy, only aer tsr double mutants are expected to show a motility phenotype in tryptone plates. Finally, the product of trg is a transmembrane methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein that senses ribose and galactose [23]. Although these sugars are absent from tryptone plates, deletion of trg did result in a measurable motility defect (unpublished data). Therefore, of the more than 50 known genes involved, trg is the only false negative under the motility conditions we used. Remarkably, the selection results revealed many genes with high z-scores without a previously known role in motility. We were concerned that some marginally high z-scores may be due to "hitchhiking" of spontaneously arising mutations in motility genes on the background of transposon insertions in nonessential genes. To minimize such false positives, we demanded that a candidate motility gene obtain a z-score above 12 in at least two of the three replicate selections (Datasets S2, S3, and S4). The 40 candidate genes that fit these criteria were targeted for deletion, and 20 of them were found to show a significant defect in swimming motility (Figure 1C; Table S1). We observed that some false positives were indeed due to hitchhiking, but others were due to polar effects of transposon insertions on downstream genes within operons. Additionally, some genes may be deemed false positive because the nature of the mutation caused by transposon insertion cannot be replicated by a clean deletion of the gene. The criteria we used for identifying candidate motility genes favored sensitivity (essentially 100%) over specificity. However, the number of false positives can be driven lower by decreasing the cycles of selection, increasing the number of replicates, or by focusing on genes with relatively high z-scores. In the sections that follow, we explore the manner in which the validated newly identified genes affect motility.
