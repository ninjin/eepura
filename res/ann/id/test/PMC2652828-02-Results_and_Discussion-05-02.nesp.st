T1003	Span 22 200	appears to play a role in the regulation of the translational machinery itself presumably as a feedback mechanism to maintain tight control over the amount of ribosomal synthesis

T1005	Span 825 953	suggests that Hfq normally represses translation of these genes under conditions that mimics the intracellular environment (AMM)
