Components of the cell surface 
It has been shown in E. faecalis that at least one cell surface protein (Ace) is subject to domain variation [20] and it has been postulated that domain variation may help bacteria escape the immune system. We found more polymorphisms in two families of E. faecalis proteins present on the cell surface: the MSCRAMMs and the WxL domain surface proteins. The MSCRAMMs are composed of two large regions, namely, the non-repeat A region (which is usually the ligand binding region for extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen or fibrinogen) and the B region (which typically contains repeated sub-domains). The B region of Ace contains five repeats in OG1RF, while it contains only four in V583 [20]. We found two other MSCRAMM proteins that show polymorphisms in the number of their B repeats. OG1RF_0186 (corresponding to EF2505 of V583) has four repeats compared to seven in V583, and OG1RF_0165 (corresponding to EF2224 of V583) has eight repeats compared to five in V583. It has been proposed that the repeats are used as a stalk that projects the A region across the peptidoglycan and away from the cell surface [32]. A hypothesis that the number of repeats may be proportional to the depth of the peptidoglycan has been proposed [32]. However, OG1RF_0186 carries fewer repeats than EF2505 while Ace and OG1RF_0165 carry more repeats than their counterparts in V583, suggesting that our observation does not fit this hypothesis or that the peptidoglycan depth is not uniform. Apart from these three MSCRAMMs with B-repeat polymorphisms, we identified two unique MSCRAMM proteins in OG1RF: a homologue of EF0089 (OG1RF_0063, which shares 48% similarity) and a homologue of EF1896 (OG1RF_0039, which shares 75% similarity); both are located in the approximately 49 kb region unique to OG1RF described below (Figure 1; Additional data file 1). Another family of E. faecalis surface proteins includes the newly described WxL domain surface proteins. Siezen et al. [33] reported a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins that is conserved in a subgroup of Gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster has at least one member of three gene families: a gene encoding a small LPxTG protein (approximately 120 amino acids); a gene encoding a member of the DUF916 transmembrane protein family; and a gene encoding a WxL domain surface protein. In addition, members of these gene families were found as singletons or associated with genes encoding other proteins (Additional data file 2). Recently, it was shown that the WxL domain attaches to the peptidoglycan on the cell surface [34] and one member of this WxL domain family, the homologue of EF2686 in OG1RF (a probable internalin protein), was shown to be important for virulence in a mouse peritonitis model and is required for dissemination to the spleen and liver [35]. OG1RF shares five complete WxL loci with V583 (EF0750-7, EF2682-6, EF2970-68, EF3181-8, and EF3248-53). OG1RF does not contain homologues of EF2248-54 (carrying instead the iol operon), though it has a novel WxL locus within the 14.8 kb unique region upstream of the fsr locus (Additional data file 2). In addition to the variation in the number of WxL loci, we also observed polymorphisms in six of the WxL domain surface proteins. For example, OG1RF_0213 shares 88% similarity with EF3188, while OG1RF_0224, OG1RF_0225, and OG1RF_0227 share 64-68% similarity with their V583 counterparts, EF3248, EF3250, and EF3252, respectively. Also, in place of EF3153, EF3154, and EF3155 (which share 70% similarity among themselves), were found non-distantly related homologues, OG1RF_0209 and OG1RF_0210, which share 60-80% similarity with EF3153, EF3154, and EF3155. It is interesting to note that while several of these WxL loci, including the EF0750 and EF3184 loci, were present by hybridization in all the strains (clinical or food isolates) tested by Lepage et al. [36], other loci, including the EF3153 and EF3248 loci, were not detected in the majority of these strains. In addition, it appears that the EF3248 locus diverges in the Symbioflor 1 strain. When compared to V583, the sequence identity in this area between the two strains appears to be as low as 75% (depicted in Figure 2 from reference [5]). However, because the Symbioflor 1 genome sequence is not currently available, it was not possible to compare their respective sequences in more detail. Since these proteins are located at the surface of the cell, the low level of homology shared between them may be the result of antigenic variation. More analyses are required for a better understanding of the number, frequency and function of these WxL domain proteins and their possible relationship with the diversity of E. faecalis. Finally, as previously found using PCR, the cpsCDEFGHIJK operon capsule polysaccharide genes [37] were confirmed here as missing, although OG1RF carries the cpsA and cpsB genes, which were proposed to be essential for E. faecalis since all strains tested by Hufnagel et al. [37] carry these two genes. In OG1RF, the region that would encode the cps operon is only 59 bp in length and has no homology with V583. Thus, while V583 and OG1RF share much similarity between their surface components, there are unique differences that could potentially be important in affecting the behavior of the strains and might be useful for strain typing.
