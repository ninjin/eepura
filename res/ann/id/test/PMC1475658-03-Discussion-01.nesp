<sentence id="1">Pathogens have developed a plethora of strategies that allow them to exploit host resources and resist the attacks of the host immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To study how flies deal with infections in a natural context , we investigated the interactions between Drosophila and a newly identified entomopathogen , P. entomophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using a combined genetic approach for both the host and pathogen we reveal the importance of the local immune response in host defense against gastrointestinal infections and provide an in vivo demonstration for the role of a bacterial metalloprotease in protection against AMPs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our analysis reveals that P. entomophila virulence is multi-factorial , as one <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">expect</scope></cue> , but can be decrypted through genetic analysis of the two interacting partners</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Local Expression of AMP Genes Plays a Major Role against Food-Borne Infections The use of GFP reporter transgenes in Drosophila has revealed that , in addition to the fat body , AMP genes can be expressed in several barrier epithelia that are in direct contact with microorganisms from the environment [ 7,23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="2">The precise relevance of this local immune response in Drosophila has <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> been established to date</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The present study demonstrates a key role for the local Imd immune response in the gut against oral infection by bacterial pathogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The Imd pathway regulates a large number of immune genes including those encoding AMPs ; and two peptides , Diptericin and Attacin , are preferentially synthesized following bacterial infection in the digestive tract of Drosophila [ 7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">To explore the potential implication of AMPs in the Imd immune defense against oral infection by P. entomophila , we compared survival of flies expressing only a single AMP .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our study reveals that over-expression of either Diptericin or Attacin confers protection against P. entomophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This observation , combined with our data demonstrating that P. entomophila expresses specific virulence factors in order to resist AMPs , underlines the critical role of local AMP expression against food-borne pathogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Previous studies revealed only a modest contribution of Diptericin to resistance against Gram-negative bacteria during systemic infection [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In contrast , our data reveal that Diptericin plays an essential role in the defense against Gram-negative bacteria when they are ingested .</sentence>
<sentence id="14"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The antibacterial activity of Diptericin <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be enhanced in the gut by pH and other factors such as lysozymes [ 24 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">It is also <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> that Diptericin <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> reach high concentration levels in restricted areas of the Drosophila gut such as the proventriculus</scope> and thus be more effective against pathogens than in other body compartments</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Our study <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggests</cue> that Diptericin expression in the anterior gut provides an efficient early barrier allowing Drosophila to rapidly eliminate most ingested bacteria</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Finally , it remains surprising that P. entomophila infection triggers a systemic immune response that has <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">no</cue> overt function against the bacteria that remain in the gut lumen</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">This response could be interpreted as anticipation of <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">possible</cue> breaching of the gut barrier</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Alternatively , our results <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggest</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">possibility</cue> that bacteria such as P. entomophila <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">may</cue> subvert insect host defenses by triggering this systemic response</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">This can be compared with many human pathogens for which activation of an inflammatory response represents a part of their invasive strategy [ 25 ] .</sentence>
