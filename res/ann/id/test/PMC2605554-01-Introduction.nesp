<sentence id="0">Introduction</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Streptococcus pyogenes ( group A streptococcus ; GAS ) is a Gram-positive , human-specific pathogen responsible for over 500,000 deaths each year [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Severe invasive GAS infections such as necrotizing fasciitis account for approximately 30 % of these deaths , and the incidence of such acute conditions has been on the rise since the mid 1980 's [ 2 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This resurgence has been paralleled by the emergence of a globally disseminated GAS cone belonging to serotype M1T1 [ 3 ] - [ 5 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">While the M1T1 GAS has become the most common cause of streptococcal pharyngitis , this clone is also overrepresented in cases of severe invasive disease [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Studies of M1T1 clinical isolates from invasive disease cases have revealed an inverse relationship between expression of the extracellular cysteine protease SpeB and clinical severity [ 8 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The existence of a SpeB-negative invasive phenotype has been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that results from mutations in the regulator covR/S [ 9 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">SpeB is a secreted cysteine protease initially expressed as 40 kDa zymogen which is then converted to the 28 kDa active form by autocatalytic processing [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">SpeB is known to cleave numerous host proteins including components of the extracellular matrix , cytokine precursors , immunoglobulins and antimicrobial peptides [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> interfere with host immune functions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , SpeB has also been shown to cleave a range of GAS proteins such as the fibrinogen-binding M1 protein [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , various superantigens [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , the secreted plasminogen activator streptokinase [ 18 ] as well as the DNase Sda1 [ 17 ] , and thus <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibly</cue> interfere with the proven virulence functions of these bacterial factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The precise role(s) of SpeB throughout the course of infection are undoubtedly complex , and <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> surprisingly</scope> , different studies using different in vivo animal models have produced seemingly contradictory results [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In this study we examined the effect of a natural mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB ( also known as Rgg [ 22 ] ) identified in a SpeB-negative GAS clinical isolate .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">RopB is a GAS transcriptional regulator that has been shown to be essential for expression of SpeB and binds directly to the promoter region of speB [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In studies performed in different GAS serotype strains , <scope type="spec" id="4"> RopB has variably been <cue type="spec" id="4">suggested</cue> to be involved in the regulation of other GAS genes including those associated with metabolism of non-glucose carbohydrates and amino acids [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , response to thermal and oxidative stress [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] and the expression of virulence factors including DNases ( MF-1 and MF-3 ) and hemolysins ( streptolysin S and streptolysin O ) [ 26 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Subsequent investigations into the effect of RopB on virulence have yielded differing results .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">A study utilizing a zebrafish intramuscular infection model with serotype M5 GAS showed that inactivation of RopB resulted in decreased virulence [ 30 ] , whereas a study utilizing a murine intraperitoneal infection model with serotype M49 GAS showed that inactivation of RopB resulted in increased virulence [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">While such global differences in virulence effects could in part result from the differing animal models used , it <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> also reflect strain-specific variation in the RopB regulon</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">For example , separate studies have shown ropB mutation to have either <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> effect on hemolysis and DNase activity</scope> or , alternatively , to increase expression of hemolysin and DNase-encoding genes and the associated phenotypic activities [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">This strain-specific variation is highlighted in a recent work by Dmitriev et al. [ 29 ] that shows inter- and intra-serotypic variation in the transcriptome of ropB mutant GAS , with only members of the SpeB operon being commonly regulated in all strains tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">It is in the light of the current uncertainty surrounding RopB and its role in virulence that we sought to investigate the role of this transcriptional regulator in the serotype M1T1 GAS background that is the leading agent of severe human infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">This analysis begins with a naturally-occuring mutation in ropB identified in one such strain .</sentence>
