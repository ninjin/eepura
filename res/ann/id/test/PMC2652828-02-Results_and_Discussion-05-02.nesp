<sentence id="1">Hfq also <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to play a role in the regulation of the translational machinery itself <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">presumably</cue> as a feedback mechanism to maintain tight control over the amount of ribosomal synthesis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several ribosomal proteins including RpsM , RpsG , RpmD , and RplN exhibited a marked reduction in both protein and mRNA levels in the Deltahfq mutant strain compared to the wildtype under LB Stat growth condition .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">One hallmark of growth under nutrient poor conditions is lower expression of the machinery necessary to synthesize proteins , including tRNA synthetases and other factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In fact all of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ( IleS , ProS , CysS , GlnS , AspS , ArgS , GltX , AlaS , TrpS , GlyS , GlyQ ) observed were up-regulated in the Deltahfq mutant relative to the wild type without a concurrent change in transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that Hfq normally represses translation of these genes under conditions that mimics the intracellular environment ( AMM )</scope> .</sentence>
