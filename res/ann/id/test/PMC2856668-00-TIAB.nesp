<sentence id="0">Inactivation of DNA-Binding Response Regulator Sak189 Abrogates beta-Antigen Expression and Affects Virulence of Streptococcus agalactiae</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background Streptococcus agalactiae is able to colonize numerous tissues employing different mechanisms of gene regulation , particularly via two-component regulatory systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These systems sense the environmental stimuli and regulate expression of the genes including virulence genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , the novel two-component regulatory system Sak188/Sak189 was identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In S. agalactiae genome , it was adjacent to the bac gene encoding for beta-antigen , an important virulence factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Methodology/Principal Findings In this study , the sak188 and sak189 genes were inactivated , and the functional role of Sak188/Sak189 two-component system in regulation of the beta-antigen expression was investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It was demonstrated that both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta-antigen were controlled by Sak189 response regulator , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> Sak188 histidine kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It was also found that the regulation occurred at transcriptional level .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , insertional inactivation of sak189 gene , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> sak188 gene</scope> , significantly affected virulent properties of S. agalactiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Conclusions/Significance Sak189 response regulator is necessary for activation of bac gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">It also controls the virulent properties of S. agalactiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Given that the primary functional role of Sak188/Sak189 two-component systems is a control of bac gene transcription , this system can be annotated as BgrR/S ( bac gene regulatory system ) .</sentence>
