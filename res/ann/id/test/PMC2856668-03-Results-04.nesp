<sentence id="0">Effect of insertional inactivation on transcription of bac gene</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In order to analyze if changes in beta-antigen expression are regulated at transcriptional level , the quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RNA samples isolated during the middle-exponential phase corresponding to 2 hrs of growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As result , transcription of bac gene in sak189/sak188 double mutant strain was 17-fold less than in 168/00 wild-type strain ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">On the other hand , the bac gene transcription level in sak188 mutant strain was almost similar to that in the wild-type strain that confirmed the results of SDS-PAGE and western-blotting .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , these data demonstrate that Sak189 protein regulates expression of beta-antigen at transcriptional level .</sentence>
