<sentence id="0">Components of the cell surface</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It has been shown in E. faecalis that at least one cell surface protein ( Ace ) is subject to domain variation [ 20 ] and it has been postulated that domain variation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> help bacteria escape the immune system</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found more polymorphisms in two families of E. faecalis proteins present on the cell surface : the MSCRAMMs and the WxL domain surface proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The MSCRAMMs are composed of two large regions , namely , the non-repeat A region ( which is usually the ligand binding region for extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen or fibrinogen ) and the B region ( which typically contains repeated sub-domains ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The B region of Ace contains five repeats in OG1RF , while it contains only four in V583 [ 20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found two other MSCRAMM proteins that show polymorphisms in the number of their B repeats .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">OG1RF_0186 ( corresponding to EF2505 of V583 ) has four repeats compared to seven in V583 , and OG1RF_0165 ( corresponding to EF2224 of V583 ) has eight repeats compared to five in V583 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It has been proposed that the repeats are used as a stalk that projects the A region across the peptidoglycan and away from the cell surface [ 32 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="2"> A hypothesis that the number of repeats <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be proportional to the depth of the peptidoglycan</scope> has been <cue type="spec" id="2">proposed</cue> [ 32</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , OG1RF_0186 carries fewer repeats than EF2505 while Ace and OG1RF_0165 carry more repeats than their counterparts in V583 , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that our observation does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> fit this <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">hypothesis</scope></cue> or that the peptidoglycan depth is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> uniform</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Apart from these three MSCRAMMs with B-repeat polymorphisms , we identified two unique MSCRAMM proteins in OG1RF : a homologue of EF0089 ( OG1RF_0063 , which shares 48 % similarity ) and a homologue of EF1896 ( OG1RF_0039 , which shares 75 % similarity ) ; both are located in the approximately 49 kb region unique to OG1RF described below ( Figure 1 ; Additional data file 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Another family of E. faecalis surface proteins includes the newly described WxL domain surface proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Siezen et al. [ 33 ] reported a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins that is conserved in a subgroup of Gram-positive bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Each gene cluster has at least one member of three gene families : a gene encoding a small LPxTG protein ( approximately 120 amino acids ) ; a gene encoding a member of the DUF916 transmembrane protein family ; and a gene encoding a WxL domain surface protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">In addition , members of these gene families were found as singletons or associated with genes encoding other proteins ( Additional data file 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Recently , it was shown that the WxL domain attaches to the peptidoglycan on the cell surface [ 34 ] and one member of this WxL domain family , the homologue of EF2686 in OG1RF ( a <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">probable</cue> internalin protein )</scope> , was shown to be important for virulence in a mouse peritonitis model and is required for dissemination to the spleen and liver [ 35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">OG1RF shares five complete WxL loci with V583 ( EF0750-7 , EF2682-6 , EF2970-68 , EF3181-8 , and EF3248-53 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">OG1RF does <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> contain homologues of EF2248-54 ( carrying instead the iol operon )</scope> , though it has a novel WxL locus within the 14.8 kb unique region upstream of the fsr locus ( Additional data file 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">In addition to the variation in the number of WxL loci , we also observed polymorphisms in six of the WxL domain surface proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">For example , OG1RF_0213 shares 88 % similarity with EF3188 , while OG1RF_0224 , OG1RF_0225 , and OG1RF_0227 share 64-68 % similarity with their V583 counterparts , EF3248 , EF3250 , and EF3252 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Also , in place of EF3153 , EF3154 , and EF3155 ( which share 70 % similarity among themselves ) , were found non-distantly related homologues , OG1RF_0209 and OG1RF_0210 , which share 60-80 % similarity with EF3153 , EF3154 , and EF3155 .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">It is interesting to note that while several of these WxL loci , including the EF0750 and EF3184 loci , were present by hybridization in all the strains <scope type="neg" id="9">( clinical or food isolates ) tested by Lepage et al. [ 36 ] , other loci , including the EF3153 and EF3248 loci , were <cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> detected in the majority of these strains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">In addition , it <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">appears</cue> that the EF3248 locus diverges in the Symbioflor 1 strain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">When compared to V583 , <scope type="spec" id="11"> the sequence identity in this area between the two strains <cue type="spec" id="11">appears</cue> to be as low as 75 % ( depicted in Figure 2 from reference [ 5 ] )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">However , because the Symbioflor 1 genome sequence is <scope type="neg" id="12"><cue type="neg" id="12">not</cue> currently available</scope> , it was not <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">possible</cue> to compare their respective sequences in more detail</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">Since these proteins are located at the surface of the cell , the low level of homology shared between them <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">may</cue> be the result of antigenic variation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">More analyses are required for a better understanding of the number , frequency and function of these WxL domain proteins and their <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">possible</cue> relationship with the diversity of E. faecalis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">Finally , as previously found using PCR , the cpsCDEFGHIJK operon capsule polysaccharide genes [ 37 ] were confirmed here as missing , although OG1RF carries the cpsA and cpsB genes , which were proposed to be essential for E. faecalis since all strains tested by Hufnagel et al. [ 37 ] carry these two genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">In OG1RF , the region that would encode the cps operon is only 59 bp in length and has <scope type="neg" id="16"><cue type="neg" id="16">no</cue> homology with V583</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">Thus , while V583 and OG1RF share much similarity between their surface components , there are unique differences that <scope type="spec" id="17"> <cue type="spec" id="17">could</cue> <scope type="spec" id="18"> <cue type="spec" id="18">potentially</cue> be important in affecting the behavior of the strains</scope></scope> and <scope type="spec" id="19"> <cue type="spec" id="19">might</cue> be useful for strain typing</scope> .</sentence>
