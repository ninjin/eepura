Introduction 
Group A streptococci (GAS) are human pathogens that infect over 700 million children and adults each year [1]. Whereas the overall mortality rate of GAS infections is less than 0.1%, the mortality rate of invasive GAS infections, which have resurged in the past 30 years, mounts to 25% (out of >650,000 new cases per year) [1]. Among the various GAS serotypes, the globally disseminated M1T1 clonal strain remains the most frequently isolated from cases of invasive and non-invasive infections [2], [3], and although disease severity partially depends on host genetic factors [4], [5], [6], M1T1 GAS possesses unique genomic features that contribute to its evolutionary fitness [7], [8], [9], [10]. Among these features is the ability of M1T1 bacteria to switch to a hypervirulent phenotype associated with invasive diseases in vivo [11], [12], [13], [14], a phenomenon that is not fully understood and whose specificity to the M1 serotype remains to be established [15]. We previously reported that virulent representatives of M1T1 GAS, with the phenotype SpeBhi/SpeA-/Sda1low, irreversibly switch to the hypervirulent SpeB-/SpeA+/Sda1high phenotype after >/=3 days in vivo [12], [16] and that the parent phenotype vanishes by day 7 post-infection [16]. Subsequent studies uncovered that this genetic switch is driven by host innate immune pressure that selects for bacteria with pathoadaptive mutations in the covRS genetic locus [13], [14]. CovRS is a two-component regulatory system, in which CovS transduces external signals [17], [18] to CovR, which in turn represses the transcription of several group A streptococcal (GAS) virulence gene sets, including the capsule synthesis operon (hasABC), the streptolysin S operon (SLS or sagA-H), and the streptokinase gene (ska) [19], [20]. CovR regulatory activity is thought to be triggered when the protein is phosphorylated at D53 [21], possibly by acetyl phosphate [22], [23]. On the other hand, under stress conditions, CovS dephosphorylates CovR and reverses virulence gene repression [21], [22]. Mutations in covS are thus expected to affect CovR phosphorylation status differentially in vitro and in vivo (under stress conditions), and to consequently modulate CovRS signaling-regulation circuits in a complex manner that remains largely unexplored. This complexity is further magnified by the reported strain-specific differences in the impact of CovS on pathogenesis [24], by the finding that phosphorylated CovR has different affinities to different streptococcal promoters [21], and by the possibility that CovR promoter binding may be modulated by kinases or phosphatases other than CovS [25]. In fact, CovR retains some of its functions in the absence of wild type CovS [26], and different covS mutations, albeit clustered in its histidine kinase domain, might have different effects on expression of CovR-regulated genes [27]. In accordance with these biochemical findings, we and others have reported that some covS mutations generate hypervirulent isolates associated with invasive forms of streptococcal infection [13],[14],[26],[28]. One of the most striking outcomes of these mutations is the constitutive repression of a gene encoding the key GAS cysteine protease, SpeB, which remodels the host-pathogen interface [29] by differentially degrading bacterial surface and secreted proteins [12], [30], [31] as well as host proteins [32], [33], [34]. Consequently, absence of a proteolytically active SpeB preserves several virulence factors that it normally degrades [12], [35]. One of these preserved factors is the highly potent DNase, Sda1, which destroys neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs [36], protecting the bacteria from neutrophil killing, promoting bacterial invasion, and facilitating human plasminogen-mediated bacterial dissemination into normally sterile sites, which results in invasive infections [14]. Despite the association between covS mutations and the emergence of the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, it is unclear whether this increased virulence can be entirely attributed to the modulation of the CovR regulon or if other networks are also perturbed in vivo directly, indirectly, or independently of the CovRS system. Additionally, the effects of covS mutations on bacterial niche adaptability are still undetermined because the in vivo transcriptomes of the wild type (WT) and animal-passaged (AP) bacteria have not been compared under the same experimental conditions. To address these issues and improve our understanding of the gene regulatory impact of mutational and adaptive events contributing to the hypervirulent phenotype of M1T1 strains, we analyzed differences in growth requirements, transcriptome profiles, and regulatory circuits of the virulent (WT) and hypervirulent (AP) phenotypes of the M1T1 strain both in vitro and during initial in vivo infection. Such comprehensive analyses highlighted the behavior of genomic subsystems that may be involved directly or indirectly in S. pyogenes niche adaptation and pathogenesis. In addition, this approach offered a rare transcriptional snapshot of the SpeBhi/SpeA-/Sda1low population prior to its extinction in vivo.
