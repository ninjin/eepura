<sentence id="3">Strain 5628RDeltaSpeB containing a full-length RopB but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> SpeB</scope> also showed reduced virulence , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that the reduced virulence of 5628 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> primarily result from the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of SpeB expression in this strain</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Virulence was also examined in an intravenous model of systemic infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The well characterized strain 5448 and its isogenic mutant 5448R- , containing the ropB allele from 5628 , were further included to examine the effect of this allelic variation in a well-characterized virulent strain of GAS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The two strains containing a truncated RopB ( 5628 and 5448R- ) demonstrated similarly reduced virulence compared to the two strains containing a full-length RopB ( 5628R+ and 5448 ) ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">4B ) , confirming that inactivation of RopB results in decreased virulence in systemic infection .</sentence>
