<sentence id="0">Identification of a functional DNA element for SsrB binding</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previous attempts by others to identify a conserved SsrB DNA recognition motif have been unsuccessful .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To overcome this , we employed a bacterial one-hybrid screen originally developed to define binding site preferences for eukaryotic transcription factors [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We fused the DNA binding domain of SsrB ( SsrBc ) to the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase and screened a prey library of approximately108 DNA molecules previously counter-selected against self-activation ( Figure 4A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We used the PhoP response regulator from E. coli as a control because a DNA recognition sequence for it was known [ 28 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Bait-prey combinations surviving selection on medium lacking histidine were purified , and preys were sequenced and analyzed using the motif-finding program MEME [ 29 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">From 189 unique sequences isolated for SsrBc , over 80 % contained a degenerate consensus motif , mCCyTA ( Figure 4B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In control screens with the PhoP-alphaNTD fusion , the PhoP box sequence (G/T)GTTTA was identified in 11 % of sequenced preys ( 12/109 <scope type="neg" id="1"><scope type="neg" id="0">, data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> but this sequence was <cue type="neg" id="1">never</cue> captured by SsrB-alphaNTD and vice versa</scope> , demonstrating specificity of the bacterial one-hybrid system for prokaryotic regulatory proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Next , we examined our ChIP-on-chip data for the presence of a conserved regulatory motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We extracted sequence data from the local maxima of the 256 binding peaks and analyzed the sequences with the computational program MDscan [ 30 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Using the highest-ranking probes to generate an initial prediction followed by lower-ranking probes for refinement , this analysis identified motifs that represented either the forward or the reverse complement of the consensus sequence ACmTTA , which shares consensus with the motif identified in the bacterial one-hybrid screen ( Figure 4B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We identified variations of this motif within footprinted regions of SsrB-regulated promoters [ 25 ] , , however sequence degeneracy made it difficult to precisely map the input functions .</sentence>
