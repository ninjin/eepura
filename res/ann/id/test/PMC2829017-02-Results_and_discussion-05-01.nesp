<sentence id="0">In vivo transcript profiling</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Before investigating the in vivo transcript profile of A. pleuropneumoniae , we used self-self hybridizations in order to quantifiy the dye bias effect after hybridization on AppChip2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Duplicate experiments showed a R2 correlation factor of 0.996 between the intensity detected for the Cy3 labelled and Cy5 labelled probes , and <scope type="spec" id="1"> only two genes <cue type="spec" id="1">seemed</cue> to qualify as obvious outliers ( data <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="2">Both genes , APL_1141 and APL_0484 , were <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> identified as differentially expressed during the course of a natural infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">While designing the microarray experiments , growth in BHI medium to an optical density of 0.3 at a 600 nm wavelenght was chosen as our reference condition .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This condition was not only chosen for practical reasons , but also to fulfill two precise objectives : first , to allow for the identification of genes that , while important to the infection process , have <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> been identified previously in vitro in rich medium</scope> , and second , to allow comparison of the results obtained in vivo to those obtained in our laboratory in other growth conditions by keeping the same reference [ 28-30 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Working with a limited amount of biological material meant that <scope type="spec" id="4"> only one time-point in the infection <cue type="spec" id="4">could</cue> be investigated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the acute stage of porcine pleuropneumonia , bacteria are <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">likely</cue> in the exponential phase of growth</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This is also the case in the control condition .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The transcriptome of A. pleuropneumonia is certainly very different when the infection is in the chronic stage .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Therefore , while our results are an accurate representation of the transcriptomic events that occur in vivo during the acute phase of the infection process as compared to those occuring in vitro in a rich culture medium , events occuring earlier of later in the infection process cannot be inferred .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In vivo transcript profiling experiments were performed on samples from three different lesion sites on the euthanized pig .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Since this pig was euthanized on site by a veterinarian , the time laps between the death of the animal and tissue sampling was kept to a minimum .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Following microarray hybridization and analysis , 86.7 % of all coding sequences included on AppChip2 could be detected during our experiments , and 150 genes were significantly differentially expressed in vivo when their level of expression was compared to that seen in vitro , with a FDR of 4.25 % over the course of three hybridizations : 72 of these were up-regulated , while 78 were down-regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Functional classification of these genes revealed that up-regulated genes mostly belonged to the " Transport and Binding Proteins " and " Energy Metabolism " classes , with respectively 17 and 14 genes ( see Additional file 1 and Figure 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Repressed genes mostly belonged to the " Protein Synthesis " , " Energy Metabolism " and " Cell Envelope " functional classes .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">A large number of genes encoding " Hypothetical/Unknown/Unclassified " products were differentially expressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Only ten out of the 150 differentially expressed genes ( 8.2 % ) could be found in the list of divergent or highly divergent/absent genes in at least one reference strain of A. pleuropneumoniae , as established by Goure et al. [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Three of these are involved in surface structures , namely LPS and capsule , biosynthesis ( genes kpsF , cps5b and cpxC ) , and two others are found in phage-associated regions ( APL_0512 and APL_0524 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Of the last five genes , four are divergent in only one strain ( hktE , fur , phoR and hisH , respectively in reference strains from serotypes 8 , 2 , 15 and 7 ) , and the APL_0999 gene codes for a hypothetical protein that is divergent in serotype 2 , 7-11 and 14 reference strains .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">a ) Validation of microarray results by qRT-PCR In order to confirm results obtained using the AppChip2 A. pleuropneumoniae microarray , eleven genes were selected for qRT-PCR analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Five of these were up-regulated in vivo ( sohB , hbpA , kpsF , apxIVA , phoR ) and six were down-regulated ( nlpI , visC , proQ , APL_1456 , APL_1135 and nusG ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">These genes represented a large range of log2 ratio values .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">In all cases , microarray results were supported by those obtained by qRT-PCR : all genes that were identified as up-regulated using the AppChip2 also showed up-regulation following qRT-PCR analysis , and the same was true for selected down-regulated genes ( Figure 4 ) .</sentence>
