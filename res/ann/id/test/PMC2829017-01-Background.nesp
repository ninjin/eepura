<sentence id="0">Background</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia , a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes great economic losses worldwide [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transmission occurs through aerosol or close contact with infected animals or asymptomatic carriers , and can affect pigs of all ages [ 2 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the acute phase , the disease is often lethal in 24 to 48 h , and leads to the formation of extensive fibrinohemorrhagic lung lesions .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Animals that survive the infection often become healthy carriers , and develop localized necrotizing lesions associated with pleuritis [ 3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Fifteen different serotypes can be identified based on differences in capsular polysaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">While serotypes 1 to 12 and 15 usually belong to biotype 1 , which contains strains that are NAD-dependent , serotypes 13 and 14 are usually NAD-independent and belong to biotype 2 [ 4 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , biotype 2 variants of serotypes 2 , 4 , 7 and 9 have been reported [ 5-7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Despite years of research , mechanisms involved in A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenicity are still <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> fully understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">While many virulence factors have been identified , such as lipopolysaccharides , capsular polysaccharides , Apx toxins and iron acquisition systems [ 4 ] , or <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> , like biofilm formation [ 8 ] , autotransporter adhesin [ 9 ] and autotransporter protease synthesis [ 10 ] , very little is known about the overall contribution of each component to the infection process</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In order to gain new insight into the disease , researchers have relied on techniques that allow for the identification of genes expressed in bacteria during infection of the host [ 11 ] , namely In Vivo Expression Technology ( IVET ) , Signature Tagged Mutagenesis ( STM ) and Selective Capture of Transcribed Sequences ( SCOTS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">First , an IVET experiment with A. pleuropneumoniae led to the identification of 10 loci ( termed ivi ) transcribed in vivo [ 12 ] and highlighted the importance of genes involved in branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) synthesis [ 13,14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Later , over the course of two STM experiments conducted with A. pleuropneumoniae , nearly 3000 mutants were screened in vivo [ 15,16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Both experiments showed that iron acquisition was highly important for the virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae , with the identification of mutants impaired for the ExbB-ExbD-TonB energy-transducing system .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The study by Sheehan et al [ 16 ] , lead to the identification of a second set of exbB-exbD-tonB genes , and it was determined that inactivation of tonB2 and not tonB1 lead to attenuation in vivo [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">More recently , SCOTS experiments were conducted with A. pleuropneumoniae , at two different stages of infection : at the end of the acute stage , in necrotic lung tissues ( 7 days post-infection ) [ 18 ] , and in the chronic stage ( 21 days post-infection ) [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">These studies demonstrated the importance of anaerobic metabolism and HlyX-regulated mechanisms during A. pleuropneumoniae infection in the lungs , and led to the identification and characterisation of a maturation autotransporter protease , AasP , responsible for cleavage and release of fragments of OmlA from the cell surface [ 19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">The HlyX regulon was characterized recently , and iron-regulated protein B ( FrpB ) was identified as a potentially important virulence factor up-regulated when A. pleuropneumoniae is grown in oxygen-deprived environments [ 20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Although these in vivo studies have been very valuable in gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenesis , limitations associated with the techniques used lead only to a partial overview of the transcriptional events taking place in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">DNA microarrays have been used to determine the complete transcriptomic profile of microorganisms in vitro , but technical drawbacks that are associated with the use of this technique in vivo , such as the qualitative and quantitative recovery of bacterial RNA from host tissues , explain why the use of this technique to monitor bacterial infections has been limited [ 21 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">While various cell culture , ex-vivo or mouse infection models have been used , in vivo experiments can provide more accurate information on bacterial adaptation and virulence when the natural host is studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">To the best of our knowledge , only two genome-wide transcriptional profiling experiments using DNA microarrays have been conducted with bacterial pathogens in their natural host , during a natural infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">LaRocque et al. have evaluated the transcriptome of Vibrio cholerae in the early and late stages of the disease by collecting stools of naturally infected patients [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Son et al. used fresh sputum samples from a patient with cystic fibrosis to study the in vivo transcriptome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">Additionally , Agarwal et al. used a custom-made Fur and iron regulon microarray to investigate the expression of these genes during gonococcal infection in women [ 24 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">In this study , we have conducted in vivo transcript profiling with DNA microarrays of A. pleuropneumoniae during the acute phase of a natural infection in pigs .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> 150 genes are differentially expressed during the acute phase of infection in the host</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">Of these , 72 were up-regulated , and three of these encode lipoproteins or OMPs that are well-conserved among strains of A. pleuropneumoniae .</sentence>
