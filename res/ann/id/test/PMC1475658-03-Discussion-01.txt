Discussion 
Pathogens have developed a plethora of strategies that allow them to exploit host resources and resist the attacks of the host immune response. To study how flies deal with infections in a natural context, we investigated the interactions between Drosophila and a newly identified entomopathogen, P. entomophila. Using a combined genetic approach for both the host and pathogen we reveal the importance of the local immune response in host defense against gastrointestinal infections and provide an in vivo demonstration for the role of a bacterial metalloprotease in protection against AMPs. Our analysis reveals that P. entomophila virulence is multi-factorial, as one might expect, but can be decrypted through genetic analysis of the two interacting partners. Local Expression of AMP Genes Plays a Major Role against Food-Borne Infections The use of GFP reporter transgenes in Drosophila has revealed that, in addition to the fat body, AMP genes can be expressed in several barrier epithelia that are in direct contact with microorganisms from the environment [7,23]. The precise relevance of this local immune response in Drosophila has not been established to date. The present study demonstrates a key role for the local Imd immune response in the gut against oral infection by bacterial pathogens. The Imd pathway regulates a large number of immune genes including those encoding AMPs; and two peptides, Diptericin and Attacin, are preferentially synthesized following bacterial infection in the digestive tract of Drosophila [7]. To explore the potential implication of AMPs in the Imd immune defense against oral infection by P. entomophila, we compared survival of flies expressing only a single AMP. Our study reveals that over-expression of either Diptericin or Attacin confers protection against P. entomophila. This observation, combined with our data demonstrating that P. entomophila expresses specific virulence factors in order to resist AMPs, underlines the critical role of local AMP expression against food-borne pathogens. Previous studies revealed only a modest contribution of Diptericin to resistance against Gram-negative bacteria during systemic infection [22]. In contrast, our data reveal that Diptericin plays an essential role in the defense against Gram-negative bacteria when they are ingested. The antibacterial activity of Diptericin may be enhanced in the gut by pH and other factors such as lysozymes [24]. It is also possible that Diptericin could reach high concentration levels in restricted areas of the Drosophila gut such as the proventriculus and thus be more effective against pathogens than in other body compartments. Our study suggests that Diptericin expression in the anterior gut provides an efficient early barrier allowing Drosophila to rapidly eliminate most ingested bacteria. Finally, it remains surprising that P. entomophila infection triggers a systemic immune response that has no overt function against the bacteria that remain in the gut lumen. This response could be interpreted as anticipation of possible breaching of the gut barrier. Alternatively, our results suggest the possibility that bacteria such as P. entomophila may subvert insect host defenses by triggering this systemic response. This can be compared with many human pathogens for which activation of an inflammatory response represents a part of their invasive strategy [25].
