The iol operon 
OG1RF carries an iol operon while V583 does not. This operon encodes the factors necessary for the degradation of myo-inositol into glyceraldehyde-3P. Many soil and plant micro-organisms, including Bacillus subtilis [41] (first iol operon identified), Klebsiella spp. [42], and cryptococci [43], have been reported to use myo-inositol as a sole carbon source. Myo-inositol, one of the nine isomers of the inositol group, belongs to the cyclitol group and is abundant in nature, particularly in the soil. The OG1RF iol operon appears to be closely related to ones described in Clostridium perfringens [44] and Lactobacillus casei [45]. In L. casei, the myo-inositol operon consists of ten genes with an upstream divergent regulator gene, iolR. In OG1RF, the operon appears to include ten genes, beginning with a probable transcriptional regulator (helix-turn-helix domain protein). Also, the OG1RF operon carries two copies of an iolG-like gene, which encodes inositol 2-dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the myo-inositol degradation pathway (Figure 5). However, the order of the genes is not the same between E. faecalis and L. casei. In addition, iolH,iolJ and iolK, present in L. casei, are not present in OG1RF, nor are iolH and iolK present in the C. perfringens iol operon. Yebra et al. reported that L. casei was the sole member of the Lactobacillales to carry a functional iol operon [45]. To survey E. faecalis, also a member of this order, for the presence of the iol operon, 48 isolates with different MLST and/or from various origins (including OG1RF and V583) were tested for myo-inositol fermentation; 23 of 48 isolates were positive. In addition, PCR verified the presence of iolE and iolR in these strains and in one negative for myo-inositol fermentation, indicating that the iol operon is not unique to OG1RF. To verify that the iol genes are responsible for the fermentation of myo-inositol in OG1RF, transposon insertion mutants [9] in the iolB and iolG2 genes of OG1RF were tested. Both mutants failed to ferment myo-inositol (data not shown), demonstrating that these genes are essential for myo-inositol fermentation. To investigate whether the iol operon was 'inserted into' or 'removed from' a putative ancestral strain, the sequences surrounding the iol genes were examined. In OG1RF, the iol operon is located between the equivalent of EF2239 and EF2352 when compared with V583. In V583, this region encodes probable prophage proteins and carries the vanB transposon, which confers vancomycin resistance. Since we did not identify any remnants of the iol operon in V583, it would appear that at least two independent events at the same location differentiate OG1RF and V583, suggesting that it is a hot region for rearrangement. This region between EF2239 and EF2352 (111 Kb) is also missing in the Symbioflor 1 strain (referred to as gap 2) [5]. The possible junction and presence of unique sequence in this region, if investigated, was not mentioned in the publication. Nonetheless, preliminary analysis of other strains' genotypes in this area seemed to confirm the hypothesis of a hot region for rearrangement (data not shown).
