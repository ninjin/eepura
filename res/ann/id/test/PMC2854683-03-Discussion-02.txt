Environmental adaptation vs. covS mutation 
In vitro, the growth of these two variants of the M1T1 bacteria was comparable and, although 137 (5.9%) of their genes were differentially expressed (Table 2), in vitro phenotypic screening revealed negligible differences (Table 1). This suggests that the majority of in vitro vs. in vivo differentially expressed genes between the WT and AP variants may be involved in niche adaptation. This finding is in agreement with studies showing that the CovRS system is mainly linked to the regulation of virulence factors and virulence-associated pathways [19], [20], [24], [26], [27], [28], [52], [53], [54], [55]. Indeed, several virulence genes were among the 137 in vitro differentially expressed genes between these two M1T1 variants. Upregulated gene sets in AP vs. WT bacteria in vitro included Mga locus genes (e.g., sic, emm, scp); hyaluronic acid capsule-encoding genes (hasABC); and genes encoding the toxins SpeA, SclA, SLO, and the streptodornase Sda1 (Fig. 2, Fig. S2, and Table 3). Other well-studied gene sets were downregulated in AP bacteria grown in vitro. Besides metabolic gene sets involved in trehalose and ascorbate utilization, several known virulence factors were downregulated in AP bacteria, and these included the SpeB operon, GRAB, EndoS, and CAMP factor. SpeB is a major virulence factor in GAS pathogenesis and its expression is regulated by different systems [40], [56], [57], [58], including the CovRS system [20], [53]. Whereas SpeB expression may be important in the initial stages of skin infections [29], [35], its downregulation has been associated with an invasive and hypervirulent phenotype [13], [14], [59]. The downregulation of GRAB makes biological sense because this protein binds alpha-2-macroglobulin in blood [60] to protect the bacteria against its own protease, SpeB, and thus the bacteria no longer need to express high levels of GRAB when SpeB is not expressed. Similarly, EndoS, an IgG protease, and CAMP, a hemolysin, are likely needed in blood but with no defined function in subcutaneous or deep tissue. Their downregulation in AP is thus consistent with the hypothesis that this hypervirulent variant is adapted for deep infection. In addition, the downregulation of SpeB, EndoS, and CAMP is in agreement with our previous proteomic results [12] as well as other published transcriptional analyses [13], [27]. As both bacterial variants were subjected to the host environment, they underwent additional changes in gene expression. In vivo, both WT and AP bacteria downregulated a substantial number of their genes (127 genes in CC1 and CC2, Fig. 2 and Table S1), and upregulated many fewer (24 genes in CC3, Fig. 2 and Table S1). By parsing these differentially expressed genes into operons, subsystems, and functional pathways, we found that many reflect the engagement of several regulatory networks involved in metabolic adaptation and immune camouflage or evasion of host defenses. Many of the in vivo changes that both the WT and AP bacteria underwent are suggestive of major metabolic reprogramming associated with the transition from a saprophytic lifestyle in the carbohydrate-rich laboratory culture medium to a parasitic lifestyle in the vascularized and the anaerobic subcutaneous environments rich in peptides, amino acids, nucleotides, and different types of complex carbohydrates. For example, among the downregulated gene sets are those involved in citrate metabolism, arginine degradation, and de novo pyrimidine synthesis; many of those gene sets were previously reported to be perturbed upon blood inoculation and to be controlled by CovR [61] and RopB/Rgg [38]. We also found that many ribosomal and cell-division proteins were downregulated in vivo, which suggests that the cells may be slowing down protein synthesis to preserve energy, or redirect this energy to colonizing the host and evading its immune system. The downregulation of arginine deiminase, a streptococcal immunogen and a potential vaccine target (Henningham et al., submitted), is also suggestive of immune evasion. Among the upregulated genes are dipepetide and sucrose-specific transporters, whose upregulation supports the hypothesis that the bacteria are switching diets [39] and attempting to scavenge nutrients available in their new host environment. Several phage genes are split between the upregulated and downregulated gene clusters; this may indicate a stress-dependent reprogramming of prophage induction and gene expression that needs to be explored in future studies. Interestingly, what this study revealed is that some of the downstream regulatory effects of the covS mutation in AP bacteria are only manifested in vivo. For example, several gene sets (e.g., SLS genes, Trx-locus genes, L-ascorbate utilization genes) were upregulated in WT bacteria in vivo, but were mostly silenced in AP bacteria in vivo (Fig. 2, CC6). On the other hand, genes encoding the fibrinolytic enzyme streptokinase, Ska, a RofA-like transcriptional regulator, several cell division proteins, and some phage proteins were only upregulated when the AP bacteria sensed the in vivo environment (AP-vivo, Fig. 2, CC10). Both these expression patterns suggest CovS-dependent in vivo signaling via different downstream pathways. Finally, genes encoding the antiphagocytic M protein, and the toxins streptolysin O and NADGH were among few genes that were upregulated in all conditions except WT-vitro (Fig. 2, CC7), which suggests that their transcription is dependent on multiple signals, including signals from the host as well as covS-dependent cues. Taken together, these results demonstrate how the murine model has allowed us to finely dissect two classes of events affecting GAS sociomicrobiology: those related to reversible transcriptional adaptation and those irreversibly caused by the covS mutation in AP bacteria.
