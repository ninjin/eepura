<sentence id="0">A 14.8 kb region inserted in the 23.9 kb region containing fsrA and fsrB</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nakayama et al. [ 29 ] described a conserved 23.9 kb chromosomal deletion when comparing fsrA-lacking/fsrC+/gelE+ strains ( by PCR ) from various origins with V583 ; the deleted sequences start in the middle of EF1841 , include the fsrAB genes and end in the middle of the fsrC gene ( EF1820 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Loss of the fsr regulatory components results in a gelatinase-negative phenotype under routine test conditions despite the fact that these strains still carry the gelE gene [ 23,29 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="5">The Symbioflor 1 strain , used as a probiotic , is one representative of the 7.4 % of E. faecalis isolates that are missing the gelE gene in addition to the 23.9 kb region [ 5,30 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our analysis of this area in OG1RF revealed the presence of an additional 14.8 kb fragment inserted between the corresponding EF1826 and EF1827 of OG1RF ( confirmed by PCR ; <scope type="neg" id="4">results <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
