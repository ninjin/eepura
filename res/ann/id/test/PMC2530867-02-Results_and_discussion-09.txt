Limited presence of mobile elements 
By probing a microarray of the V583 genome and plasmids with OG1RF genomic DNA, we previously estimated that only 75% of V583 ORFs were also present in OG1RF [22]. Later, Aakra et al. [53] compared nine strains, including OG1RF to V583, using comparative genomic hybridization. In these results, OG1RF appears to carry a few genes included in the PAI, and a few prophage genes. Using the complete genome sequence, we have now found that OG1RF lacks 639 genes and the three pTET plasmids described in V583. All but 45 of the missing genes are associated with putative mobile elements, such as the entire PAI, the recently described phages 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 [31], and the approximately 111 kb area between genes EF2240 and EF2351 (including the vanB transposon) present in V583. The absence of these elements appears also to be a characteristic of the commensal strain Symbioflor 1, although because the genome was not completely finished, the possibility remains that some of these regions were not sequenced. In conclusion, other than the approximately 49 kb fragment containing a Tn916 homologue, it appears that OG1RF has only one additional possible mobile element derivative, namely the phage 2 proposed to be part of the core genome [31].
