<sentence id="0">Global Systems-Level Analysis of Hfq and SmpB Deletion Mutants in Salmonella : Implications for Virulence and Global Protein Translation</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using sample-matched transcriptomics and proteomics measurements it is now <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> to begin to understand the impact of post-transcriptional regulatory programs in Enterobacteria</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In bacteria post-transcriptional regulation is mediated by relatively few identified RNA-binding protein factors including CsrA , Hfq and SmpB .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A mutation in any one of these three genes , csrA , hfq , and smpB , in Salmonella is attenuated for mouse virulence and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">unable</cue> to survive in macrophages</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">CsrA has a clearly defined specificity based on binding to a specific mRNA sequence to inhibit translation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , <scope type="neg" id="2">the proteins regulated by Hfq and SmpB are <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> as clearly defined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Previous work identified proteins regulated by hfq using purification of the RNA-protein complex with direct sequencing of the bound RNAs and found binding to a surprisingly large number of transcripts .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In this report we have used global proteomics to directly identify proteins regulated by Hfq or SmpB by comparing protein abundance in the parent and isogenic hfq or smpB mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">From these same samples we also prepared RNA for microarray analysis to determine <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">if</cue> alteration of protein expression was mediated post-transcriptionally</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Samples were analyzed from bacteria grown under four different conditions ; two laboratory conditions and two <scope type="spec" id="4"> that are <cue type="spec" id="4">thought</cue> to mimic the intracellular environment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We show that mutants of hfq and smpB directly <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">or</cue> indirectly</scope> modulate at least 20 % and 4 % of all possible Salmonella proteins , respectively , with limited correlation between transcription and protein expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These proteins represent a broad spectrum of Salmonella proteins required for many biological processes including host cell invasion , motility , central metabolism , LPS biosynthesis , two-component regulatory systems , and fatty acid metabolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our results represent one of the first global analyses of post-transcriptional regulons in any organism and <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that regulation at the translational level is widespread and plays an important role in virulence regulation and environmental adaptation for Salmonella</scope> .</sentence>
