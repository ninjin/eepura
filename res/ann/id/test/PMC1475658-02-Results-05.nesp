<sentence id="0">Local , but Not Systemic Immunity , Contributes to Resistance against Oral Infection with P. entomophila</sentence>
<sentence id="1">P. entomophila , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> the gacA derivative</scope> , rapidly activates both the local and systemic Imd-dependent immune responses in Drosophila adults , which can be demonstrated using RT-qPCR with fat body and gut extracts ( Figure 5A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Use of Diptericin-GFP or lacZ reporter genes reveals strong Diptericin expression in the proventriculus , an organ that acts as a valve between the oesophagus and the anterior midgut ( Figure 5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> a critical role of this organ in the elimination of bacteria</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We next examined the respective contribution of the local gut and the systemic immune responses to controlling P .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">entomophila infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We thus compared resistance to P. entomophila infection of flies that were previously either orally infected with Ecc15 ( to activate a local immune response ) or pricked with Ecc15 ( to activate a systemic immune response ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The rationale behind this experiment is based on previous observations that an oral infection with Ecc15 triggers a local , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> a systemic immune response at the adult stage ( our unpublished data ) [ 8 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Figure 5C shows that a prior infection with Ecc15 protected flies against a subsequent P. entomophila infection only when Ecc15 was administrated orally , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> the local , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> the systemic immune response</scope> , plays an important role in P. entomophila clearance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">To ascertain that the protection was due to Imd pathway activation and <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> to a competition between P. entomophila and Ecc15</scope> , we next monitored resistance to P. entomophila of wild-type and Rel flies orally infected by Ecc15 evf- .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We used the evf-deficient derivative because this bacterium triggers a local immune response <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">without</cue> persisting in the gut</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This experiment shows that wild-type , but <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> Rel flies</scope> previously infected with Ecc15 evf- , resisted a second challenge by P. entomophila ( Figure 5D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This demonstrates that the protection was indeed due to Imd pathway activation in the gut .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The results described above were corroborated by the over-expression of Imd in the gut or in the fat body using specific Gal4 drivers .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Over-expression of Imd in the gut protected against P. entomophila , whereas its activation in the fat body did <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> ( Figure S2</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">However , the previous results did <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> address <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">whether</cue> the Imd pathway induced during the course of a natural P. entomophila infection contributes to fly resistance to P. entomophila</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Thus , we next compared survival of Rel flies specifically expressing a wild-type copy of Rel in the intestine using caudal (cad)-Gal4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">These flies <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">lack</cue> a functional Imd pathway except in the gut where cad-Gal4 is expressed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">In these flies , the Imd pathway was <scope type="neg" id="12"><cue type="neg" id="12">not</cue> constitutively active in the gut</scope> but could be induced upon oral bacterial infection similarly to the wild-type situation ( Figure S3A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Figure 5E shows that Rel flies expressing Rel in the gut survive better than Rel mutant flies .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">These data demonstrate that the P. entomophila-induced local immune response in the intestine plays an important role in the defense against this Gram-negative bacterium .</sentence>
