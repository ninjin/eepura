<sentence id="0">Data integration reveals genomic subsystems influenced by the covS mutation in vitro and in vivo</sentence>
<sentence id="1">By combining different strategies for microarray data analysis , we took advantage of the strengths of each strategy to generate biologically relevant gene sets <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> gene lists ordered solely according to statistical parameters</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The next stage in our analysis was to integrate microarray data , moving from the gene/cluster level to the level of biological subsystems .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A subsystem is a part of a genome that represents a functional module , e.g. , an operon , a cellular pathway , a regulon , or a complex regulatory network [ 43 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The genes perturbed by the different experimental conditions of this study correspond to multiple subsystems ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Of interest , among the genes of known function , 25 % of those whose transcription was modulated as a consequence of the covS mutation are virulence-related and another 25 % are related to carbohydrate metabolism pathways , which are connected to virulence in streptococci [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">When we attempted to correlate the array results with known GAS regulons , some differentially expressed gene sets could be fitted into previously described regulatory networks while others did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> belong to any such networks</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">For example , the upregulation of Ska , SLO/Nga , and the Has operon is a pattern that reflects the inhibition of CovR repression , whereas the downregulation of both SpeB and SLS operons is a pattern associated with the transcriptional regulator RopB/Rgg [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] but that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> also reflect augmented CovR repression [ 20</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Although CovS is expected to modulate many known CovR-repressed subsystems , <scope type="spec" id="3"> certain operons <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be differentially modulated</scope> or <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be influenced by other regulator(s)</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Alternatively , the mutation in covS <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> have different effects on CovR-mediated regulation of different genes [ 26 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In fact , our in vivo data show that covR itself is downregulated in vivo in both WT and AP strains ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">2 , CC2 and Table S1 ) ; however , the SLS operon is upregulated in vivo in WT bacteria , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggesting</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="6">its regulation is <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> solely modulated by CovRS</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">It is <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">possible</cue> that SLS is regulated by the catabolite control protein ( CcpA ) , which was recently shown to be another key transcriptional regulator of the SLS operon [ 46 ] and which <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> override CovR-mediated repression of SLS</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Another complex regulatory pattern is exhibited by the genes of the Trx locus , which include a two-component regulatory system , TrxRS .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">The TrxRS system reportedly responds to a yet-to-be-identified extracellular signal while TrxR itself is directly regulated by CovR [ 42 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Most genes within the Trx locus are downregulated in AP GAS relative to WT , but upregulated in the WT bacteria in vivo ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">2 , CC6 and Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">3 ) <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">suggesting</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">possibility</cue> of CovS-dependent in vivo signaling</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">One last factor that adds to the complexity of data integration analysis and that <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">may</cue> explain unexpected transcriptional patterns</scope> is that regulators are often controlled by sensitive feedback mechanisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Inactivation or downregulation of one regulator <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">may</cue> eventually perturb the entire system</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="14"> several other regulators are <cue type="spec" id="14">likely</cue> to become engaged in compensatory mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis</scope> .</sentence>
