SsrB binds to six promoters within the SPI-2 genomic island 
In order to rigorously evaluate our genome-wide functional genomics data, we compared it against traditional biochemical experiments describing SsrB-DNA interactions at the SPI-2 locus. Previous data reported SsrB footprints upstream of 6 genes in SPI-2: ssrA, ssrB, ssaB, sseA, ssaG, and ssaM [25],[26]. Our ChIP-on-chip data showed discrete SsrB binding at all of these promoters except for the promoter reported to be between ssrA and ssrB [25] (Figure 3). We attempted to verify functional activity at this site, but could not using transcriptional fusions (data not shown). Our data also identified three additional SsrB binding peaks upstream of sseA, within the CDS of ssaJ, and in the IGR upstream of ssaR (Figure 3). Functional interactions were confirmed for sseA and ssaR in subsequent reporter experiments described below.
