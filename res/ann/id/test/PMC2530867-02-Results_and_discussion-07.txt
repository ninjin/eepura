A homologue of Tn916 in OG1RF 
An analysis of the G+C content of OG1RF unique regions revealed several loci with a lower G+C content than the 37.8% average content of OG1RF. One of these is an approximately 49 kb fragment with a G+C content of 32.1% located between an rRNA operon and the homologue in OG1RF of EF1053, replacing 10 tRNA genes present in V583 (Figure 1). This fragment appears to be a patchwork composed of hypothetical genes, homologues of Tn916-associated genes and homologues of genes from other Gram-positive organisms, including Listeria, E. faecium, staphylococci, or lactococci (Additional data file 1). It is interesting to note that this region contains: a putative adhesin protein gene (OG1RF_0039) at one end of the fragment; homologues of 14 Tn916-associated genes (Tn916_2 to Tn916_12, Tn916_18 and Tn916_19, with an average of 70% similarity); and a gene encoding a putative integrase (OG1RF_0088) at the other end - these three features are also present in Tn5386 in E. faecium D344R [46]. However, the approximately 49 kb fragment lacks an excisase gene and the probable lantibiotic ABC transporter genes present in Tn5386.
