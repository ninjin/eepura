Genes involved in nutrient scavenging 
Induction of different types of nutrient uptake systems in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus further emphasized the possible differences in nutritional requirements of the two bacteria in the insect host. Ion scavenging systems induced in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi are completely different. In P. temperata, pchC, a gene involved in the biogenesis of pyochelin type of siderophore [61], was upregulated indicating the importance of iron, whereas a siderophore-independent zinc ion transport system encoded by gene znuA [62] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi indicating the importance of zinc. Also supported by the pathway analysis, product of glnD identified from P. temperata likely controls the production of siderophore (see Additional file 1). In addition to ion scavenging systems, artM, encoding a putative ABC amino acid transport system [63] was identified in P. temperata, but not in X. koppenhoeferi. Besides transporting L-arginine across the inner membrane [63], the pathway network reveals that the product of artM participates in cystine transport (see Additional file 1), suggesting that this gene may also mediate cystine amino acid acquisition. Upregulation of artM in P. temperata also suggests that amino acids may be available for uptake in the insect. Similarly, it has been discussed previously that histidine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the possible components presented in the insect host hemolymph, may be important food sources used by P. luminescens for growth within the insect host [64]. As cysteine synthesis gene cysK was also identified from P. temperata as discussed above, it may indicate that the level of cysteine either synthesized by P. temperata or acquired from the insect host is not sufficient during infection. Interestingly, X. koppenhoeferi seems to require sugar as malF gene which is involved in uptake for maltose and lactose was upregulated. Further, P. temperata but not X. koppenhoeferi induced tolB gene that encodes a Tol protein upon insect infection. As a periplasmic protein, TolB is an extra member in the Tol system. In E. coli, Tol system stabilizes the outer membrane structure and mutations in Tol encoding genes result in hypersensitivity to deleterious agents [65]. Despite unknown mechanistic details of Tol system, upregulation of P. temperata tolB gene suggests that it may be involved in importing biomolecules by somehow supplying energy or transport as noted by Nikaido [66] in other bacteria.
