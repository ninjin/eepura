<sentence id="0">yhjH Affects Flagellar Motor Bias</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mutations in yhjH were recently found to impair swimming motility [ 42 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Consistent with this , we found that insertions in yhjH exhibit a high average z-score of +277 in our enrichment for nonmotile mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Surprisingly , this gene showed a negative z-score of -8 after bacteriophage chi selection , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> this mutant is impaired in swimming motility but <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> show increased susceptibility to chi-phage infection relative to the wild-type strain</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Based on these observations , we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesized</cue> that this mutant has flagella with an extreme CCW rotation bias , a phenotype also exhibited , to varying degrees , by cheA , cheR , and cheW mutants [ 43 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To further characterize the effect of this mutation on motility , an in-frame deletion of yhjH was constructed .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Electron microscopy of DeltayhjH mutants showed the appearance of flagella , and light microscopy showed vigorous cellular movement ( unpublished data ) , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> the flagella are capable of rotating ; still , this mutant exhibited severe impairment in swimming ( Figure 1C )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To determine <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">whether</cue> the absence of yhjH alters the direction of flagellar rotation</scope> , several functional studies were performed .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">First , chi-phage infectivity assays with DeltayhjH mutants showed comparable levels of infection to cheR mutants ( which exhibit CCW flagellar rotation bias ) in contrast to the reduced sensitivity displayed by cheZ mutants ( which have CW flagellar rotation bias ) , consistent with the z-scores of our chi-phage selection ( Figure 5E ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Second , while DeltayhjH mutants are impaired in swimming motility , they did <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> show a measurable defect in swarming ( Figure 6A ) , which is in agreement with our finding that flagellar motor switching is <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> critical for swarming</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In a final functional test , individual cells of four different strains-wild-type cells and mutants with yhjH , cheR , and cheZ deletions-were tethered to a microscope slide and the frequency of flagellar rotation switching was measured using computer tracking software in a fashion similar to Block et al. [ 44 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These measurements revealed that indeed the flagella of DeltayhjH mutants , while not strictly locked in one direction of rotation , exhibit a strong CCW bias with a rotational switching frequency intermediate between that found in wild-type cells and in DeltacheR mutants ( Figure 6B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This finding is consistent with the chi-phage selection results .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Tether assays with DeltayhjH DeltacheZ double mutants showed flagellar rotation indistinguishable from cheZ single mutants ( unpublished data ) , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicating that</cue> null mutations in cheZ are epistatic to null mutations in yhjH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Together , these results <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">indicate that</cue> the yhjH gene product is involved with the frequency of flagellar motor switching , a process that is among the remaining puzzles in bacterial chemotaxis [ 45 ]</scope> .</sentence>
