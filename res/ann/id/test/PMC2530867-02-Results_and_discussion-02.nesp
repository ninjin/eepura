<sentence id="0">CRISPR loci</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The CRISPR ( comprised of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) loci encoded by some bacterial strains is a recently described system that protects cells from infection with bacteriophage [ 25-27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The specificity of the phage resistance conferred by the CRISPR elements and CRISPR-associated genes ( cas genes ) is determined by spacer-phage sequence similarity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">OG1RF carries two CRISPR elements : CRISPR1 ( between the OG1RF homologue of EF0672 and EF0673 ) and CRISPR2 ( between the OG1RF homologue of EF2062 and EF2063 ) ; CRISPR1 is linked to cas-like genes while CRISPR2 is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> ( Figure 3</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">Both</cue> OG1RF CRISPR elements are composed of 7 repeats of a 37 bp palindromic sequence with a 29 bp spacer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">None of the 29 bp spacers ( 14 total ) have homology to any sequences in GenBank .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The CRISPR1-associated proteins belong to the Nmeni subtype [ 28 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Species bearing this CRISPR/cas subtype have so far been found exclusively in bacteria that are vertebrate pathogens or commensals .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The Nmeni subtype is characterized by the presence of four specific cas genes and a single copy of the repeat that is upstream of the first gene in the locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The four cas genes encode Cas_csn1 ( <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> endonuclease</scope> ) , Cas1 ( novel nuclease ) , Cas2 ( conserved hypothetical protein ) , and Cas_csn2 ( conserved hypothetical protein ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The repeat upstream of cas_csn1 <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to have degenerated since it shares only 23 bp with the 37 bp repeat cluster downstream of the last gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">A unique feature of the OG1RF CRISPR1 locus is the presence of a gene downstream of the element , which encodes a hypothetical 119 amino acid transmembrane protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The presence of the CRISPR loci among E. faecalis strains <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a powerful tool to avoid the load of prophage replication</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">To determine the distribution of the CRISPR1 locus in E. faecalis strains , 16 isolates of various MLST types were tested for the presence ( PCR with primers specific for csn1 and cas1 ) or absence ( PCR with primers overlapping the junction between EF0672 and EF0673 ) of the CRISPR1 locus ( Table 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Seven strains were cas positive , but negative for the junction and the remaining nine were positive only for the junction .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">This <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicates that</cue> <scope type="spec" id="6"> the location of the CRISPR1 locus <cue type="spec" id="6">appears</cue> to be conserved ( between EF0672 and EF0673 when compared with the V583 genome )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Interestingly , the two vancomycin resistant strains tested were both cas negative .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">It is appealing to postulate that the presence of the CRISPR locus in OG1RF <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be the reason for the absence of prophage in this strain</scope> .</sentence>
