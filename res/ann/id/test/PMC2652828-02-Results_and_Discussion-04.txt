Global effects of Hfq and SmpB mutation on Salmonella Typhimurium chromosome 
LC-MS-based proteomics was used to obtain a general overview of the effects of Hfq and SmpB on global protein translation in Salmonella. The differences in protein expression between parent and isogenic mutant was assessed via hypothesis testing, specifically a comprehensive ANOVA scheme included in the computer program DAnTE [30]. Relative changes in protein abundance between DeltasmpB or Deltahfq mutant strains and a wild-type strain were evaluated across four differing growth conditions. These included logarithmic (log) and stationary (stat) phase cultures and growth in two variations of an acidic, low magnesium [Mg2+] minimal media (AMM), to approximate conditions encountered in the hosts's phagocytes (Materials and Methods). Across all experimental datasets we observed a total of 1621 Salmonella Typhimurium proteins (Table S1), corresponding to approximately36% coverage of predicted protein coding regions. These proteins represent a broad spectrum of gene products from the genetic translation (Table 1), with proteins of unknown or unclassified function representing the largest functional category as might be expected. Across each of the four growth conditions examined our analysis revealed that Hfq had a far more significant effect on the Salmonella Typhimurium proteome than SmpB. Overall, in comparison to expression in the parent strain, Hfq and SmpB altered, approximately50% (781proteins) and approximately12% (189 proteins) of the observed proteome (1621 proteins) respectively, as determined by an ANOVA analysis (p<0.05) using the computer program DAnTE [30] (Table S1). When compared to the entire Salmonella proteome of 4450 annotated open reading frames (orf; [31]), 781 proteins represents approximately20% of the entire Salmonella genome. This is in agreement with a recent study that found that Hfq affects 18% of the Salmonella genome [10]. Considering the reported pleitropic nature of deletion of hfq on the biology of Salmonella Typhimurium it is likely that a proportion of the changes in protein abundances maybe a non-specific and/or secondary consequence of hfq deletion. That is, not every deregulated protein in the hfq mutant strain is necessarily directly regulated by Hfq. Indeed analysis of the correlation between Hfq-dependent proteins identified in this study and Hfq-associated mRNAs identified by Sittka et al. [10] showed an approximately 25% overlap (Table S2), similar to the approximately30% overlap observed between data from a transcriptional analysis of an Deltahfq mutant strain and data from a co-IP analysis of Hfq-associated mRNAs [10]. We report that Hfq directly or indirectly modulates approximately20% of the Salmonella genome. However this most likely is an underestimate of the true number of proteins that are regulated by Hfq, if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs of the entire Salmonella proteome (4450 orfs) that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study. Considering that we observe 36% (1621 orfs) of the entire Salmonella proteome (4450 orfs) and that 50% (781 orfs) of this observed proteome (1621 orfs) is modulated by Hfq, it would be expected that a significant portion of the unobserved Salmonella proteome (2829 orfs) would also be regulated by Hfq, thus our assertion that the approximately20% value may very well represent an underestimation. Similarly 189 proteins represents approximately4% when compared to all annotated orfs but again this is likely an underestimate of proteins regulated by SmpB if accurate protein identifications could be made for the remaining 2829 orfs that are either expressed at levels too low to be detected or not expressed under the four growth conditions employed in this study. Classification of the Salmonella proteins deregulated by either Hfq or SmpB by the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) functional categories [32] showed that Hfq modulated the expression of >/=40% of the observed proteins in 15 of the 19 functional categories annotated for Salmonella (Table 1). The "Cellular Processes" functional category represented the category with most genes impacted by Hfq (approximately63%). This category encompasses sub-categories including adaptations to atypical conditions, cell adhesion, pathogenesis, chemotaxis and motility, detoxification, toxin production and resistance, DNA transformation and cell division. Translational regulation of these genes permits more rapid adaptation than would be required if the genes had to be first transcribed. This observation may explain the acute attenuation in virulence observed for the Deltahfq mutant as well as the previously observed invasion and motility phenotypes of an Deltahfq mutant [10], [20]. We validated a representative set of proteins by comparing our results with published results. Sittka et al. [20] investigated the proteome of an Deltahfq mutant strain using 2D gel analysis, and found approximately70 differentially expressed proteins in early stationary phase. Across all growth conditions we identified 67 of the approximately70 differentially expressed proteins identified in that study. Furthermore 51 of the approximately70 Hfq-dependent proteins identified by Sittka et al. were also found to be differentially expressed in the present study. The direction of regulation of many of these proteins was in general agreement with the literature including OmpF, DppA, FliC, SurA, and LuxS as shown in Table S3. As best as we can approximate our LB Stat growth condition would most closely match the early stationary phase growth condition described by Sittka et al. [20] and hence one would expect minimal variability in a cross-comparison between both studies under these two growth conditions. Indeed the direction of regulation of 21 out of 22 differentially expressed proteins in LB Stat growth is in agreement with the literature providing validation. The exception was the SPI-1 protein SipA under LB Stat growth conditions. However under SPI-1 inducing conditions (LB Log) regulation of SPI-1 proteins by Hfq was generally consistent with the literature. To extend our validation of the proteomics results we also directly analyzed protein levels by Western blot analysis of selected proteins based on our proteomics results. Our proteomics results showed that HtrA protein levels were strongly up-regulated in the Deltahfq mutant relative to wildtype in LB Log, while OsmY and STM1513 were strongly down-regulated in the Deltahfq mutant relative to wildtype in AMM-1 and LB Stat respectively. Deletion of SmpB resulted in a significant decrease in protein expression levels of FliC under LB Log and a significant increase in the protein levels of YciF in AMM-2. Western blot analysis of the relative protein levels of each of HtrA, OsmY, STM1513, FliC, and YciF (Figure S2) served to further verify our global proteomics measurements. As transcript levels are often equated to protein expression levels, it was of particular interest to determine whether genes that showed significant changes in protein expression also exhibited significant changes in transcript levels. Examination of transcript levels using microarray analysis (>/=2-fold change) revealed a more modest effect on Salmonella transcription, with approximately11% (492 genes) and approximately8% (370 genes) of the Salmonella Typhimurium genome (4550 genes; [31]) under control of Hfq and SmpB, respectively (Table S4). The result for hfq transcriptional analysis is in general agreement with previous studies for Salmonella [10] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [33] where approximately20% and approximately15% of all genes, respectively, were regulated by Hfq, but slightly higher than the number of Hfq-dependent genes reported for E. coli [27] and Vibrio cholerae [21], approximately6% each. In light of the fact that these studies employed varying growth conditions it is not possible to perform a rigorous direct comparison across these diverse datasets. However it is worth noting that our observation that Hfq strongly regulates flagellar genes and SPI-1 TTSS genes, discussed below, is consistent with previous results in Salmonella [10], [20]. Overall, the transcription data showed fewer discernable patterns of regulation by Hfq or SmpB relative to the proteome analysis, and comparison across all growth conditions revealed little overlap in proteins and transcripts regulated by either Hfq or SmpB (Figure 3). Of the 781 proteins and 492 transcripts regulated by Hfq, 113 genes overlapped both sets. For SmpB-regulated proteins (189) and transcripts (370) there was an overlap of 20 genes. Given the fact that the present study specifically examines the effects of two translational regulators, which decouple transcription and translation, a lack of correlation between transcriptomics and proteomics might be expected. Overall Hfq has a much stronger global effect on Salmonella protein translation than SmpB which is in agreement with the large number of regulatory sRNAs that serve as guides for Hfq translational modulation as opposed to the single regulatory sRNA (i.e. tmRNA) that requires SmpB for activity.
