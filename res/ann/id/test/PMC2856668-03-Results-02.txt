Construction and characterization of mutant strains 
To investigate a functional role of the two-component regulatory system Sak188/Sak189 in S. agalactiae, the sak188 and sak189 genes were inactivated by insertional mutagenesis (Fig. 2). Briefly, DNA fragments of sak188 and sak189 genes were PCR amplified using pairs of primers hkFor, hkRev, and rrFor, rrRev (Table 1), respectively. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA), and the recombinant plasmids named as pGEM-Tsak188 and pGEM-Tsak189 were digested with EcoRI. Subsequently, EcoRI fragments were cloned into suicide vector pVA891-2, and the recombinant plasmids named as pHK and pRR, respectively, were used to transform S. agalactiae strain 168/00 according to the protocol [33]. The recombinant clones were selected on THB agar plates containing 2.5 microg/ml of erythromycin. Construction of the strains was confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing (data not shown). Given that insertional inactivation of RR gene results in inactivation of HK gene [22] which are co-transcribed (Fig. 1), the strain with insertionally inactivated sak189 gene can be considered as sak189/sak188 double mutant strain, while the strain with insertionally inactivated sak188 gene-as sak188 mutant strain. Comparative analysis of the wild-type strain 168/00 and mutant strains revealed no difference in morphological properties. The size, shape and color of the colonies, diameter of zone of hemolysis, morphology of the cells and the chain length were similar in all the strains. At the same time the growth curves of mutant strains in THB slightly differed from the growth curve of the strain 168/00 (data not shown). Two time points (2 hrs and 5 hrs) corresponding to the middle-exponential and post-exponential phases of growth, respectively, were selected for further study.
