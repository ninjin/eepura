Local, but Not Systemic Immunity, Contributes to Resistance against Oral Infection with P. entomophila 
P. entomophila, but not the gacA derivative, rapidly activates both the local and systemic Imd-dependent immune responses in Drosophila adults, which can be demonstrated using RT-qPCR with fat body and gut extracts (Figure 5A). Use of Diptericin-GFP or lacZ reporter genes reveals strong Diptericin expression in the proventriculus, an organ that acts as a valve between the oesophagus and the anterior midgut (Figure 5B). This suggests a critical role of this organ in the elimination of bacteria. We next examined the respective contribution of the local gut and the systemic immune responses to controlling P. entomophila infection. We thus compared resistance to P. entomophila infection of flies that were previously either orally infected with Ecc15 (to activate a local immune response) or pricked with Ecc15 (to activate a systemic immune response). The rationale behind this experiment is based on previous observations that an oral infection with Ecc15 triggers a local, but not a systemic immune response at the adult stage (our unpublished data) [8]. Figure 5C shows that a prior infection with Ecc15 protected flies against a subsequent P. entomophila infection only when Ecc15 was administrated orally, indicating that the local, but not the systemic immune response, plays an important role in P. entomophila clearance. To ascertain that the protection was due to Imd pathway activation and not to a competition between P. entomophila and Ecc15, we next monitored resistance to P. entomophila of wild-type and Rel flies orally infected by Ecc15 evf-. We used the evf-deficient derivative because this bacterium triggers a local immune response without persisting in the gut. This experiment shows that wild-type, but not Rel flies previously infected with Ecc15 evf-, resisted a second challenge by P. entomophila (Figure 5D). This demonstrates that the protection was indeed due to Imd pathway activation in the gut. The results described above were corroborated by the over-expression of Imd in the gut or in the fat body using specific Gal4 drivers. Over-expression of Imd in the gut protected against P. entomophila, whereas its activation in the fat body did not (Figure S2). However, the previous results did not address whether the Imd pathway induced during the course of a natural P. entomophila infection contributes to fly resistance to P. entomophila. Thus, we next compared survival of Rel flies specifically expressing a wild-type copy of Rel in the intestine using caudal (cad)-Gal4. These flies lack a functional Imd pathway except in the gut where cad-Gal4 is expressed. In these flies, the Imd pathway was not constitutively active in the gut but could be induced upon oral bacterial infection similarly to the wild-type situation (Figure S3A). Figure 5E shows that Rel flies expressing Rel in the gut survive better than Rel mutant flies. These data demonstrate that the P. entomophila-induced local immune response in the intestine plays an important role in the defense against this Gram-negative bacterium.
