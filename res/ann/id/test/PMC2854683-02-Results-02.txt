In vivo murine chamber infection model allows the dissection of regulatory vs. mutation-selection events 
Several studies, including ours, have examined phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptional differences between WT and animal-passaged M1T1 GAS strains [For example, 11,12,13,16,26,27,37], but none attempted to capture the dynamic changes in the bacterial population in vivo. Because bacteria recovered from animals and cultured in the laboratory are likely to have reprogrammed many regulatory networks to re-adapt to the in vitro growth conditions, transcriptome profiling of these bacteria may not reflect their actual in vivo gene expression and regulation. In this study, we designed and performed in vivo passage experiments in which equal loads of in vitro-grown WT and AP bacteria were separately inoculated into murine subcutaneous chambers [16] and collected by needle aspiration after 24 h, a time sufficient for the bacteria to sense the host environment and transcriptionally respond to it, but not long enough to allow detectable restructuring of the bacterial community and selection of mutants. The concentrations of viable WT and AP bacteria at 24 h post-inoculation remained essentially the same: 1-5x109 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml vs. approximately2x109 CFU/ml inoculum. We extracted RNA from these bacteria immediately after their recovery from mouse chambers with no additional culturing and used the extracted RNA for transcriptome profiling as detailed in Materials and Methods. For transcriptional profiling, we followed a cyclic, two-color design and performed 28 oligonucleotide microarray hybridization experiments representing technical and biological replicates of the four cell states under investigation: WT grown in vitro (WT-vitro), WT grown in vivo (WT-vivo), AP grown in vitro (AP-vitro), and AP grown in vivo (AP-vivo), Fig. 1.
