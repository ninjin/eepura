<sentence id="0">Genetic Basis of Swarming Motility</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Whereas flagellar-mediated swimming is among the best-understood bacterial behaviors , very little is known about the genetic program that leads to the development of swarming .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Swarming is exhibited by many flagellated bacteria , and is defined as a coordinated multicellular migration across a solid surface by morphologically differentiated cells [ 28 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows swarming cells aligning themselves lengthwise and moving coordinately in groups , forming " rafts " ( Movie S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this context , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the cells <cue type="spec" id="0">appear</cue> to execute smooth swimming behavior almost exclusively , in contrast to the extensive switching back and forth seen during chemotaxis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Aside from the requirement for flagella , other aspects of the behavior are poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Because the genetic basis of swarming is not well characterized , this behavior is well suited for comprehensive analysis using our approach .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In order to explore the genetic basis of swarming , we expressed this phenotype in terms of a quantitative selection , much as was done for swimming motility .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A single round of enrichment consisted of inoculating our library of E. coli mutants onto the center of agar plates , incubating the plates to allow the cells to migrate outward from the site of inoculation , and transferring bacteria from the original area of inoculation to a fresh plate .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">After twenty rounds of daily successive transfers ( Figure 3A ) , more than 90 % of the population exhibited a defect in swarming ( Figure S5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The enriched mutants were then subjected to microarray-based genetic footprinting .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">As expected , the selection results were dominated by flagellar and chemotaxis genes ( Figure 3B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">While mutants with a defect in the flagellar apparatus did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> swarm</scope> , chemotaxis mutants formed swarming patterns as finger-like projections , in contrast to the more uniform swarming patterns generated by the wild-type parent strain ( Figure 3C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> the chemotaxis sensory system and flagellar switching have an effect on , but are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> critical for , surface motility</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Although this observation contradicts earlier studies on swarming in E. coli and S. enterica [ 29 ] , more recent work has shown that chemotaxis mutants are capable of surface motility when the surface of the agar is sprayed with a fine mist of water [ 30 ] , or when the agar concentration of the swarming media is reduced from 0.6 % to 0.45 % [ 31 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">The microarray results ( Datasets S7-S10 ) guided the interrogation of additional genes that <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> have a role in swarming</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In addition to flagellar genes , we found other loci that also contribute to swarming motility ( Table S1 ) , which are discussed in more detail below .</sentence>
