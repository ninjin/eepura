<sentence id="1">Phenotype Microarrays show <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> major nutritional or metabolic differences between wild type and animal-passaged , hypervirulent M1T1 GAS We used Biolog(R) Phenotype Microarrays ( PM ) to screen 1900 different growth conditions , including a large set of different carbon and nitrogen sources</scope> , pH values and salt concentrations , as well as different concentrations of various antimicrobial agents ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">S1 ) , and found that both WT and AP GAS have similar growth requirements in vitro with minor differences .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For example , AP bacteria grew better than WT bacteria in the presence of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid , and were more sensitive to four antimicrobials ( out of 373 screened in PM ) , including the calcium-specific metal chelator EGTA , the lipophilic chelator 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline , and the antibiotics tobramycin and cefotaxime ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , when both bacterial variants were grown at 37degreesC in the enriched Todd Hewitt broth medium , their growth rates were indistinguishable , and the only detectable difference was that AP bacteria were more buoyant in liquid culture compared to WT .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This difference in buoyancy can be attributed to differences in proteolytic activity ( WT >> AP ) that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> degrade many surface proteins , including pilin , or induce changes in the surface charge making bacterial aggregates more compact</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The difference in buoyancy can also be attributed to differences in the expression of hyaluronic acid capsule ( AP > WT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Although the PM results confirm previous experiments [ 16 ] showing a few minor differences between WT and AP bacteria in vitro , this technology is limited because it uses minimal media and measures microbial respiration as a growth indicator ( http://www.biolog.com ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Minimal media are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> optimal for the expression of GAS proteins , which <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> explain why GAS failed to grow at many of the PM conditions ( Fig</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">S1 ) and why fewer phenotypic differences were observed between WT and AP bacteria than transcriptomic differences ( see below ) .</sentence>
