<sentence id="0">Genome-Wide Identification of Genetic Interactions</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The identification of novel genes that influence the expression of a phenotype is only the first step towards understanding its genetic basis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Gene products function within the context of highly interconnected structural and regulatory networks .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We can dissect the genetic network context in which newly identified genes function by making libraries of double mutants in which a transposon library is constructed in the background of a mutation of interest .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The phenotypic characterization of this library by a screen or selection can identify genetic interactions between the query mutation and all possible insertional mutations in the genome , thereby revealing the local genetic context in which the query locus functions to influence the phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Systematic analyses of such interactions in yeast [ 46,47 ] are providing a wealth of knowledge about gene function and pathway organization .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">An important class of such interactions is suppressor mutations that either partially or fully restore the phenotype deficits of a query mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In a genome-wide effort to identify suppressors of swimming defects , additional libraries of transposon insertional mutants were created in genetic backgrounds containing gene deletions of interest .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Secondary insertional mutations were observed to suppress motility defects in Deltahns and DeltayhjH genetic backgrounds ( Figures 6C and S8A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These suppressor mutations were identified by inoculating soft-agar plates with approximately108 double mutants and extracting cells from the motile front after approximately20 h of incubation at 30 degreesC .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">A sample of suppressor mutants extracted from the extreme edge of the motile front was used for both microarray-based genetic footprinting , and for isolation of individual mutants for subsequent characterization .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Transposon insertion sites were identified in individual clones by applying the genetic footprinting procedure outlined in Figure S1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Among the 18 suppressor mutants sampled at random from the DeltayhjH background , half had insertions in different regions of ycgR , a gene encoding a protein of <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> function ( Figure 6D</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">This finding is consistent with a recent report in which the inactivation of ycgR was observed to improve motility of yhjH mutants [ 48 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The other half of DeltayhjH suppressor mutations were found to contain insertions within the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed genes yfgF and yfgG , which encode gene products of <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue> function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">P1 transduction of this insertion to the DeltayhjH isogenic background confirmed the ability of the insertion to suppress the motility defect ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">However , deletions of either yfgF or yfgG produced <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> measurable difference in motility in the DeltayhjH background ( Figure S9</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Conversely , overexpression of yfgF ( but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> yfgG )</scope> was found to suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants ( Figure 6E ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Microarray-based genetic footprinting of the entire pool of mutants extracted from the motile front guided the identification of five additional suppressor mutations ( Figure 6F ; Dataset S11 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Among the loci that partially suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH are fliZ ( a gene predicted to be a regulator of the flagellum-specific sigma factor sigma28 ) , yfiR ( a gene identified in the selection for swarming motility defective mutants ) , and three additional genes of <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">unknown</cue> function</scope> : yjdA , yjcZ , and yegE .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">We <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">hypothesize</cue> that mutations partially suppressing the chemotaxis defect of DeltayhjH mutants do so by correcting the severe CCW flagellar rotation bias</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">When combined in the same background , these mutations <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> bring the motor bias closer to the optimal operating point for chemotaxis , either by having an opposing effect on the intracellular concentration of signaling molecules known to affect motility ( discussed in the next section ) or by an <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">unknown</cue> mechanism that overrides the CCW bias</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">Further studies are underway to explore the functional relationship between yhjH and these suppressor mutations .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">The mechanisms by which deletion of yegE and overexpression of yfgF suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants are discussed in the next section .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">Suppressor mutations identified in the Deltahns background are shown and discussed in Figure S8 , and the microarray results can be found in Dataset S12 .</sentence>
