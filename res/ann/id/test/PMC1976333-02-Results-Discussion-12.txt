The Genetic Basis of Environmentally Induced Repression of Motility 
Chemotaxis in E. coli is strongly inhibited by environmental conditions such as high temperature, low pH, and high osmolarity [62-64]. Some of these environmental influences may be due to direct physicochemical perturbations to chemotaxis or flagellar function. Alternatively, these signals may provide crucial information about the cell's local environment, influencing chemotactic behavior through upstream regulatory pathways. Consistent with this picture, the promoter of the flhDC operon, the master regulator of flagellar gene expression, is one of the most highly regulated loci in the genome and contains many transcription-factor binding sites [65]. We devised a simple selection strategy to identify the genetic loci that contribute to environmentally induced variation in chemotactic behavior. We focused on inhibition of motility by high osmolarity (0.5 M NaCl), since previous evidence suggested that this environmental condition signals to the flhDC regulatory region [66]. We reasoned that null mutations in components of such upstream signaling pathways would alleviate repression of chemotaxis under high [NaCl] conditions. According to this model, the transposon insertion library should harbor mutants that perform chemotaxis in high [NaCl] as well as wild-type cells do under low [NaCl] conditions. As can be seen in Figure S12A, this is in fact what we observe since, during the same time interval, some members from the transposon mutant library travel significantly further away from the site of inoculation than do the homogeneous population of wild-type cells. In order to identify the mutations associated with the observed alleviation in suppression of motility under high [NaCl], we extracted the population of mutants that traveled to the extreme edge of the chemotaxis front. Microarray-based genetic footprinting of these mutants provided quantitative genome-wide readout of the population (Dataset S13). The selection results revealed that mutants harboring insertions in five genes (ompR, envZ, znuA, znuC, and yfiM) were the most abundant. The microarray results were confirmed by showing that individual strains with mutations in these genes showed increased motility in high [NaCl] relative to the wild-type strain (Figure S12B). OmpR and EnvZ are well-characterized members of the two-component osmoregulatory system (Figure S12C). EnvZ is the sensor kinase that phosphorylates OmpR, a DNA-binding regulatory protein, under conditions of high osmolarity [67]. Our finding that the EnvZ/OmpR signaling pathway mediates motility suppression in high [NaCl] is consistent with previous work that found phosphorylated OmpR to negatively regulate the expression of flagella by interacting with the promoter region of flhDC [66]. ZnuA and ZnuC are part of a high-affinity zinc uptake system. The role of yfiM, a novel uncharacterized gene that shows sequence similarity to a lipoprotein, is not clear at this point. Ongoing work will determine how the gene products of yfiM, znuA, and znuC contribute to this signaling pathway, either through Envz/OmpR or through a parallel pathway. We have shown that the limits on swimming motility under nominally extreme conditions can be regulated by "interpretation" of environmental signals rather than by hard physicochemical constraints on energy generation or mechanics. This argues for a more nuanced perspective on the functional constraints influencing bacterial behavior in general-including the strong coupling between behavior and environment-and an appreciation of the rich ecological context that has shaped bacterial behavior on geological time scales.
