Identification of Photorhabdus temperata or Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi specific genes 
To identify genes that were distinctive in P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi genome or exclusively induced in one or the other bacterium, comparative hybridization was performed based upon the identified genes. Twenty nine of the 40 distinct P. temperata transcripts have similar sequences in X. koppenhoeferi genome, thus 11 were P. temperata specific; 30 of the 39 distinct X. koppenhoeferi transcripts share sequence similarity with P. temperata genome, thus 9 were specific to X. koppenhoeferi (Tables 1 and 2). Although these 59 transcripts (29 + 30) corresponding to genes present in the genome of both bacteria, 21 from P. temperata and 22 from X. koppenhoeferi were identified to be exclusively induced in each of them. Only a small number of transcripts were induced in both bacteria, and most of them corresponded to genes required for stress response. Further, the level of changes in the transcripts exclusively induced in one or the other bacterium during infection of R. majalis was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on following representative genes: cysK, def, dnaB, lysR, pchC, pckA, phoP, ptst1, sctL, selD, tolB and virB from P. temperata, and aceK, clpP, cobJ, dacC, dld, malF, res, rtxC, tilS, virH, xhlA, and xkst4 from X. koppenhoeferi. qRT-PCR results displayed consistence with the SCOTS assay. Most tested genes displayed 6-16 fold induction in qRT-PCR assays, and a few genes including sctL, phoP, rtxC and clpP exhibited about 3-fold induction (Fig. 4).
