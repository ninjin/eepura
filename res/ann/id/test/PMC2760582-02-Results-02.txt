Analysis of bacterial genes induced in Rhizotrogus majalis 
Most identified transcripts were either similar to sequences from P. luminescens or X. nematophila, suggesting that bacterial transcripts were successfully enriched from the infected insects. For both bacteria, each isolated transcript was identified at least twice from the sequenced clones. The coverage of in vivo enriched libraries was then evaluated using Analytic Rarefaction according to the redundancy of each identical transcript in the sequenced clones. As indicated by the rarefaction curves (Fig. 2), saturation was achieved for the sequenced clones, indicating that most of representative genes in the in vivo enriched cDNA libraries were identified. Totally, we isolated 40 different sequences from P. temperata (Table 1) and 39 from X. koppenhoeferi (Table 2). Based on homology searches, the genes corresponding to distinct sequences could be divided into seven functional groups: cell surface structure (Class I), intracellular metabolism (Class II), nutrient scavenging (Class III), regulation (Class IV), stress response (Class V), virulence (Class VI) and uncharacterized genes (Class VII). Genes involved in metabolism constitute about 25% to 33% of the total number of in vivo-induced genes (Fig. 3), showing large numbers of metabolic changes during insect infection. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR performed on 10 randomly selected identified genes (five from P. temperata: cysK, fliA, lysR, pchC and pmt1 and five from X. koppenhoeferi: aceE, dacC, cobJ, malF, and yijC) showed that these genes were detectable from the in vivo-derived cDNA but not from in vitro-derived cDNA. In addition, 18S rRNA gene, a eukaryotic housekeeping gene, was detected in the in vivo cDNA population before normalization, but not after normalization, suggesting that bacterial cDNAs were successfully purified from the insect cDNAs after SCOTS normalization. Also gyrase A gene, a prokaryotic housekeeping gene, was not detected from the enriched in vivo cDNAs, but was detected in all other cDNA populations including in vitro and in vivo cDNAs before and after normalization, indicating that only differentially expressed genes were captured after enrichment.
