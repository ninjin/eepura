Data integration reveals genomic subsystems influenced by the covS mutation in vitro and in vivo 
By combining different strategies for microarray data analysis, we took advantage of the strengths of each strategy to generate biologically relevant gene sets rather than gene lists ordered solely according to statistical parameters. The next stage in our analysis was to integrate microarray data, moving from the gene/cluster level to the level of biological subsystems. A subsystem is a part of a genome that represents a functional module, e.g., an operon, a cellular pathway, a regulon, or a complex regulatory network [43]. The genes perturbed by the different experimental conditions of this study correspond to multiple subsystems (Fig. 5). Of interest, among the genes of known function, 25% of those whose transcription was modulated as a consequence of the covS mutation are virulence-related and another 25% are related to carbohydrate metabolism pathways, which are connected to virulence in streptococci [44], [45], [46]. When we attempted to correlate the array results with known GAS regulons, some differentially expressed gene sets could be fitted into previously described regulatory networks while others did not belong to any such networks. For example, the upregulation of Ska, SLO/Nga, and the Has operon is a pattern that reflects the inhibition of CovR repression, whereas the downregulation of both SpeB and SLS operons is a pattern associated with the transcriptional regulator RopB/Rgg [47], [48] but that may also reflect augmented CovR repression [20]. Although CovS is expected to modulate many known CovR-repressed subsystems, certain operons may be differentially modulated or may be influenced by other regulator(s). Alternatively, the mutation in covS may have different effects on CovR-mediated regulation of different genes [26]. In fact, our in vivo data show that covR itself is downregulated in vivo in both WT and AP strains (Fig. 2, CC2 and Table S1); however, the SLS operon is upregulated in vivo in WT bacteria, suggesting that its regulation is not solely modulated by CovRS. It is possible that SLS is regulated by the catabolite control protein (CcpA), which was recently shown to be another key transcriptional regulator of the SLS operon [46] and which may override CovR-mediated repression of SLS. Another complex regulatory pattern is exhibited by the genes of the Trx locus, which include a two-component regulatory system, TrxRS. The TrxRS system reportedly responds to a yet-to-be-identified extracellular signal while TrxR itself is directly regulated by CovR [42]. Most genes within the Trx locus are downregulated in AP GAS relative to WT, but upregulated in the WT bacteria in vivo (Fig. 2, CC6 and Fig. 3) suggesting the possibility of CovS-dependent in vivo signaling. One last factor that adds to the complexity of data integration analysis and that may explain unexpected transcriptional patterns is that regulators are often controlled by sensitive feedback mechanisms. Inactivation or downregulation of one regulator may eventually perturb the entire system, and several other regulators are likely to become engaged in compensatory mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis.
