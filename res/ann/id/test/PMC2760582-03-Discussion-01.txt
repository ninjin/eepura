Discussion 
Our gene expression data reveal similarities and differences in molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity by the two bacteria with apparently similar biology. As depicted in the conceptual molecular model (Fig. 5), apart from a relatively small number of common strategies used by P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi to cause infection of R. majalis, most upregulated genes were different between the two bacteria, suggesting vastly different pathways to bring about infection of the same insect host. Genes involved in cell structure modification As the physical contact between bacteria and their host is accomplished by the outer surface, the bacterial cell envelope is crucial for communication and interaction with host cells during infection. Genes involved in the synthesis of outer membrane proteins (skp in P. temperata and ompF in X. koppenhoeferi) and flagella (fliA in P. temperata and fliM in X. koppenhoeferi) were induced in both bacteria, indicating the importance of surface proteins in this bacteria-insect interface. Outer membrane proteins may contribute to the modulation of bacterial cell surface properties during interaction with the host, thus playing a role in evading host immune response [18]. Flagellum-mediated motility may provide an advantage for infection by attachment to the host surface [19,20], whereas it has been reported in X. nematophila that the expression of virulence factors is not controlled by the regulation of flagella motility [21]. Gene dacC encoding a peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase was induced in X. koppenhoeferi but not in P. temperata, implying that peptidoglycan undergoes structural alterations in X. koppenhoeferi that probably add to its fitness when residing in the host. As a well-defined virulence factor playing a major role in the development of septicemia [22], lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene lpsE was induced in X. koppenhoeferi, but not in P. temperata, which may explain in part why relatively slower growing X. koppenhoeferi did not differ from P. temperata in virulence to R. majalis in our previous studies [17].
