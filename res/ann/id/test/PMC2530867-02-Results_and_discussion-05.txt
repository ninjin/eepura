Two-component regulatory systems 
OG1RF lacks four two-component systems found in V583. These are histidine kinase-response regulator (HK-RR)08, HK-RR12 located in the PAI, HK-RR16 and the vanB regulatory system HK-RR11 [38]. However, an OG1RF-unique two-component system with high homology with the vanG locus was found at the location corresponding to the region between EF2860 and EF2861 in V583 (Table 3). OG1RF_0193 shares 82% similarity with VanRG and 81% similarity with VanRG2. Similarly, OG1RF_0192 shares 68% similarity with VanSG and VanSG2. A gene (OG1RF_0191) encoding an M15 family muramoyl pentapeptide carboxypeptidase is located downstream of these two-component regulatory genes (Figure 4a). The predicted carboxypeptidase (OG1RF_0191) shares 69% similarity over 179 amino acids with EF2297, a membrane-associated D, D-carboxypeptidase encoded by the vanB operon in V583. However, OG1RF_0191 lacks an identifiable transmembrane domain that is important to the VanY function and it is likely, therefore, that this protein may be a soluble D, D-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase as seen in Streptomyces [39] and Actinomadura [40], and thus may not be involved in peptidoglycan metabolism. Consequently, it seems unlikely that this operon is a remnant of a vancomycin resistance operon in OG1RF, but rather part of a still unknown regulatory pathway.
