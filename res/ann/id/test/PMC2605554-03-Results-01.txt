Sequence analysis of clinical isolate 5628 reveals intact speB and covR/S but mutation in ropB M1T1 GAS clinical isolate 5628 was found on screening to lack SpeB activity by azocasein assay. DNA sequencing was performed using primers listed in Table 1. No mutations were found in the strain 5628 in the speB gene nor in the covR/S locus, which has been previously linked to loss of SpeB expression [37], [38]. Further sequencing was performed on the previously described regulators luxS, rofA, ropA and ropB [24], [39]-[41]. This analysis revealed a point mutation in ropB, leading to truncation of RopB at amino acid 170 of the 280 amino acid protein (Fig. 1A). The truncation of RopB suggested that this may be the cause of lack of SpeB expression in this strain.
