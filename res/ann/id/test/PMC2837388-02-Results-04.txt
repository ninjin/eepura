Identification of a functional DNA element for SsrB binding 
Previous attempts by others to identify a conserved SsrB DNA recognition motif have been unsuccessful. To overcome this, we employed a bacterial one-hybrid screen originally developed to define binding site preferences for eukaryotic transcription factors [27]. We fused the DNA binding domain of SsrB (SsrBc) to the alpha-subunit of RNA polymerase and screened a prey library of approximately108 DNA molecules previously counter-selected against self-activation (Figure 4A). We used the PhoP response regulator from E. coli as a control because a DNA recognition sequence for it was known [28]. Bait-prey combinations surviving selection on medium lacking histidine were purified, and preys were sequenced and analyzed using the motif-finding program MEME [29]. From 189 unique sequences isolated for SsrBc, over 80% contained a degenerate consensus motif, mCCyTA (Figure 4B). In control screens with the PhoP-alphaNTD fusion, the PhoP box sequence (G/T)GTTTA was identified in 11% of sequenced preys (12/109, data not shown) but this sequence was never captured by SsrB-alphaNTD and vice versa, demonstrating specificity of the bacterial one-hybrid system for prokaryotic regulatory proteins. Next, we examined our ChIP-on-chip data for the presence of a conserved regulatory motif. We extracted sequence data from the local maxima of the 256 binding peaks and analyzed the sequences with the computational program MDscan [30]. Using the highest-ranking probes to generate an initial prediction followed by lower-ranking probes for refinement, this analysis identified motifs that represented either the forward or the reverse complement of the consensus sequence ACmTTA, which shares consensus with the motif identified in the bacterial one-hybrid screen (Figure 4B). We identified variations of this motif within footprinted regions of SsrB-regulated promoters [25],, however sequence degeneracy made it difficult to precisely map the input functions.
