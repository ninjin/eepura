RopB mutation does not affect bacterial growth, hemolysis, DNase activity or resistance to neutrophil killing 
GAS strain 5628 and its isogenic mutants 5628R+ and 5628RDeltaSpeB were grown in THB, and the OD600 was measured over time. No significant difference was found among the growth rates of the three bacterial strains (Fig. 2A). Hemolysis assays were performed to determine the effect of ropB mutation on the cytolytic ability of GAS. No significant difference was seen in hemolytic activity among strains containing the WT or mutated ropB allele (Fig. 2B). Extracellular DNase activity of mid-log phase bacteria and GAS resistance to neutrophil killing were also unaffected by mutation in ropB (Fig. 2C and 2D).
