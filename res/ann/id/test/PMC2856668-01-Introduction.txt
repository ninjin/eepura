Introduction 
Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) is an important cause of neonatal invasive infections and variety of diseases in human and animals [1], [2]. This bacterium is able to sense the changing environmental conditions and colonize numerous tissues employing different mechanisms of gene regulation. One mechanism for adaptation to changing environment is transcriptional regulation by two-component regulatory systems (TCSs), a family of systems that are widely distributed among many bacterial genera [3]. These regulatory systems comprise two proteins, sensor histidine kinase, HK, and DNA-binding response regulator, RR. HK is a sensor protein, responding to the environmental changes by autophosphorylating a conserved histidine residue. Subsequently, phosphoryl group is transferred to RR protein resulting in conformational changes in RR molecule. Conformationally modified RR molecule functions as transcriptional regulator (activator or repressor) by binding with promoter regions of the genes through helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. In many cases, two-component systems play an important role in the regulation of multiple genes encoding products which are essential for adaptation of bacteria to a particular environment and development of bacterial diseases [3]-[5]. In contrast to other pathogenic gram-positive cocci such as S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae has larger number of TCSs. For example, 20 TCSs have been identified after the complete genome sequencing in the strain NEM316 [6], and 17 TCSs-in the strain 2603 V/R [7]. Three of them, CsrRS/CovRS, DltR/DltS, and RgfA/RgfC, have been previously investigated [8]-[12]. S. agalactiae CsrRS/CovRS demonstrated high similarity with CsrRS/CovRS of S. pyogenes [8]. Inactivation of covR in S. agalactiae increased transcription levels of hemolysin cylE gene and C5a peptidase scpB gene, and reduced the level of CAMP factor cfb gene [8], [9]. Inactivation of CovRS was also observed at phenotypic level: the mutant strains became less virulent compared to the parental wild-type strain [9]. Transcriptome analysis revealed the CovRS core-regulon which consisted of 39 genes including genes of the stress response, the genes important for adhesion of S. agalactiae to the host cells and others [10]. DltR/DltS of S. agalactiae is important for transcription of dlt operon (dltA, dltB, dltC, and dltD genes), which is necessary for incorporation of D-alanine residues in lipoteichoic acids. The role of DltR/DltS in S. agalactiae virulence was shown by the attenuated virulent properties of dltA and dltR mutant strains in vivo [11]. RgfA/RgfC controls adhesion of S. agalactiae to epithelial cells. In addition, inactivation of histidine kinase gene rgfC resulted in increased transcription of scpB gene [12]. Recently, putative two-component regulatory system genes encoding for sensor histidine kinase (sak188) and DNA-binding response regulator (sak189) were identified in S. agalactiae strains 98-D60C and A909 [13], [14]. sak188 and sak189 genes were located on putative pathogenicity island [13] adjacent to the bac gene encoding for beta-antigen. This surface protein has capacity to bind IgA and factor H of complement, and it is supposed to be an important virulence factor [15]. Sak188 and Sak189 proteins revealed 78% and 83% similarity with sensor histidine kinase HK06 and DNA-binding response regulator RR06 of S. pneumoniae strains, respectively [13], [16]-[19]. In S. pneumoniae genome, the hk06 and rr06 genes are adjacent to cbpA gene encoding choline binding protein, CbpA, a surface-exposed protective antigen and virulence factor of S. pneumoniae [20], [21]. Similarly to the beta-antigen, CbpA has capacity to bind factor H of complement. In addition, some regions of CbpA protein has the certain similarity with beta-antigen. Inactivation of RR06 in S. pneumoniae resulted in the loss of CbpA expression [22]-[24]. HK06/RR06 was also important for the ability of pneumococci to adhere to epithelial cells in vitro and to survive and proliferate in an in vivo mouse model [22]. Given the certain similarity in the sequences, functions and relative locations of Sak188/Sak189 and HK06/RR06, and beta-antigen and CbpA, we suggested that Sak188/Sak189 TCS affected beta-antigen expression and virulent properties of S. agalactiae in the same manner as HK06/RR06 affected CbpA in S. pneumoniae. The goal of the present study was to investigate the function of S. agalactiae Sak188/Sak189 TCS.
