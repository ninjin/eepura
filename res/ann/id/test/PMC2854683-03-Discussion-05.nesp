<sentence id="0">Concluding remarks</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In conclusion , we have established a model that allowed us to resolve two sets of complex transcriptional events : ( i ) those occurring in response to the host environment and ( ii ) those caused by a mutation in covS sensor kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">believe</cue> that our results offer a proof of principle that in vivo-extracted RNA can provide transcriptional profiles that better reflect the complexity of heterogeneous bacterial communities , and , as shown in this study , can provide a transcriptional snapshot of a bacterial population right before its extinction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The use of in vivo-driven RNA in understanding virulence has been appreciated in streptococcal research [ 73 ] , but the technique has <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> previously been used to explain the switch to hypervirulent , invasive phenotypes</scope> or to dissect heterogeneous microbial subpopulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This study is a first step towards exploring the sociomicrobiology of invasive GAS in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Having captured snapshots of different transcriptional programs within the same bacterial community , we plan to follow with single cell studies [ 74 ] , [ 75 ] of bacteria associated with immune cells to further dissect the different roles played by members of the same bacterial community .</sentence>
