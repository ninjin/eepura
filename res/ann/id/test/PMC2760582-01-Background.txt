Background 
Entomopathogenic Gram-negative enterobacteria Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus form symbioses with the entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, respectively [1]. These bacteria not only have similar biology but are also phylogenetically related based on 16s rDNA sequence identities [2]. They naturally colonize intestines of the nematode infective juveniles which invade susceptible insects to release the bacteria into the hemolymph. The bacteria multiply in the hemolymph, killing the insect host within 24-48 h and converting the cadaver into a food source suitable for nematode growth and reproduction. After 1-3 rounds of nematode reproduction, the bacteria recolonize the emerging infective juveniles ensuring their transmission to a new host [1]. Available evidence suggests that Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus encode specific factors to engage in a pathogenic relationship with the insect host [3]. The published genome sequence of Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 strain indicates that virulence genes are encoded within a number of pathogenicity islands located on the bacterial chromosome [4,5]. Besides producing toxins to cause insect death, Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus have to first evade the insect's immune response to establish a successful infection. The two bacteria differ in mechanisms by which they evade host immune responses. For example, in Photorhabdus, mutational inactivation of phoP gene results in increased sensitivity to insect immune response and decreased virulence towards insects [6,7], while in X. nematophila, phoPQ mutants are more susceptible to immune response but are fully virulent [3]. P. luminescens produces a signaling molecule AI-2 to resist reactive oxygen species [8] and phenylpropanoid chemical ST to inhibit the activity of antimicrobial enzyme PO and formation of melanotic nodules [9], but the strategy used by X. nematophila appears to be that of suppression of transcripts involved in the insect immune response [10-12]. In addition, P. luminescens encodes a type III secretion system and one of the effectors, LopT, suppresses phagocytosis and reduces nodulation by haemocytes [13,14]. However, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do not show homologues of LopT or a dedicated type III secretion system [3], and Xenorhabdus likely uses flagellar regulatory cascade to control cellular immunity [15]. Despite the identification of the above regulatory and virulence factors from Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, the full profiles of genes expressed during insect infection by these two closely related bacteria are unknown. Munch et al. [16] identified 29 promoters induced by P. luminescens in the presence of isolated Galleria mellonella homogenate using a differential fluorescence induction approach. However, treatment with insect homogenate might neglect physicochemical parameters as inducers which could result in different sets of genes being upregulated during natural infection of live insects. We used selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) technique to study in vivo gene expression in Photorhabdus temperata (associated with the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora GPS11) and Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi (associated with the nematode Steinernema scarabaei AMK001) during infection of the same insect host Rhizotrogus majalis. They were selected according to their distinct pathogenicity in insects of the family of Scarabaeidae - S. scarabaei is more virulent to R. majalis than H. bacteriophora. However, unlike their nematode partners, both bacterial species are highly virulent to Rhizotrogus majalis. In addition, although X. koppenhoeferi grows slower than P. temperata both in vitro and in vivo, the LD50 and LT50 value do not differ between these two bacteria [17]. We hypothesize that the two bacteria species will use both common and distinct molecular mechanisms during infection of the same insect host.
