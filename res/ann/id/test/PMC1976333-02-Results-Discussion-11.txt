Involvement of Type 1 Fimbriae in Swimming Motility 
The abundance of fimE and fimB mutants in the enrichment for nonmotile mutants suggested a role for type 1 fimbriae in swimming motility. These genes encode site-specific recombinases that catalyze the inversion of a DNA element known as the fim switch or fimS, whose orientation controls the expression of fimbrial structural genes [60]. Inversion of fimS by site-specific recombinases alternately connects and disconnects the fimbrial structural genes from their promoter, resulting in a process of phase variation that gives rise to bacteria in either the fimbriate (phase ON) or afimbriate (phase OFF) state [61]. By randomly sampling mutants impaired for motility and sequencing the region of DNA adjacent to the transposon, we identified a mutant with a reduced ability to swim with an insertion within fimS. To determine the nature of the motility defect, we analyzed the fimS mutant by transmission electron microscopy. The fimS mutant exhibited a level of fimbriation similar to fimB-fimE- double mutants locked in phase ON (Figure S11A), indicating that a high level of fimbriation reduces motility in semi-solid agar. This observation is confirmed by comparing the motility of the fimS mutant to phase ON fimB-fimE- double mutants (Figure S11B). We found that swarming was not impaired in either the fimS mutant or the mutants with fimbria locked in phase ON, indicating that fimbria expression does not interfere with swarming motility (Figure S11C). The basis for motility suppression by constitutive fimbriae expression remains unclear; however, we observed that hyper-fimbriated cells tend to have, on average, fewer flagella compared to their afimbriated counterparts (Figure S11D). This may reflect competing demands for resources and/or surface area for synthesis and assembly of these extracellular appendages.
