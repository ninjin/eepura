Background 
Enterococci have emerged over the past few decades as the second to third most common cause of nosocomial infections, including urinary tract and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, and endocarditis [1-3]. They are well equipped to thrive in environments with heavy antibiotic usage due to both their intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and their talent for swapping genetic information, which allows them to gain and share resistance determinants. Entecococcal infections are predominantly caused by E. faecalis and E. faecium. However, many, if not most, strains of these species are harmless commensals, with some enterococci being marketed in Europe to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and recurrent chronic sinusitis or bronchitis (Cylactin(R) and Fargo688(R) (E. faecium) and Symbioflor 1 (E. faecalis)). To differentiate the two faces of this organism, genome-wide comparisons are necessary. Although hundreds of microbial genomes have been sequenced, only two E. faecalis genomes have been reported (V583 as a clinical isolate [4] and Symbioflor 1 as a commensal isolate [5]), but only the V583 genome has been made publicly available. In this strain, more than one-quarter of the genome is mobile DNA, more than any other sequenced bacterial genome [4]. The occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance determinants in V583 [6] makes it difficult to manipulate genetically. Moreover, the vancomycin resistance phenotype makes this strain more of a risk to handle in the laboratory. To avoid these issues, most laboratories use strain OG1 or its close derivatives. OG1 is a human isolate subsequently shown to cause dental caries in rats [7]. OG1RF is a rifampicin and fusidic acid resistant derivative of OG1 [8,9]. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, Murray et al. [10] estimated the size of the OG1RF genome as 2,825 kb and created a restriction map of the chromosome. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that OG1RF is clonally distinct from V583 (differs in six out of seven alleles of housekeeping genes) [11] and characterization of regions flanking transposon insertions in OG1RF suggested that approximately 10% of their sequences differed [12]. OG1 and its derivatives have been successfully used over the past 20 years in various animal models, starting with the demonstration that it can cause caries in germ-free rats [7], and later to characterize factors important for E. faecalis virulence in a mouse model of peritonitis [13], a rabbit model of endophthalmitis [14], a rat model of endocarditis [15] and in a mouse urinary tract infection model [16]. OG1RF was also shown to be as virulent as V583 in the model host Caenorhabditis elegans [17]. In addition to its virulence, the main reasons for the extensive use of OG1RF as a laboratory strain are that it does not carry plasmids, is readily transformable by electroporation, and is not resistant to commonly used antibiotics, other than rifampicin and fusidic acid. These resistances were serially selected in OG1 to provide strain markers [9]. The lack of resistance to common antibiotics facilitates the selection of plasmids, transposons, and allelic replacement markers introduced into the strain. Numerous factors important for virulence have been characterized in OG1RF. A recently described example are the Ebp pili, whose subunits are encoded by the ebp operon [18] and whose genes are regulated by EbpR [19]. A non-piliated mutant produces less biofilm than the parent strain and is attenuated in a rat model of endocarditis [18] and in a murine urinary tract infection model [16]. Also present is Ace, a member of the MSCRAMM (microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) family. The ace gene, like the ebp locus, is ubiquitous in E. faecalis and it occurs in at least four different forms that vary in the number of repeats of the B domain [20]. Ace mediates conditional (that is, after growth at 46degreesC or in the presence of serum or collagen) adherence of E. faecalis to collagen type IV and to laminin [21] and, in unpublished data, influences the ability of OG1RF to cause experimental endocarditis (KV Singh and BE Murray, unpublished observation). Finally, the Fsr system, a major positive and negative transcriptional regulator in OG1RF [22], affects expression of several virulence factor genes, including gelE, which encodes gelatinase [23], and contributes to infection in various animal models [15,24]. The distinct MLST profile and the wide range of phenotypic and genotypic analyses of OG1RF, including many molecular genetic studies and experiments in various animal models, suggested that genomic analysis of this strain would prove insightful and would be useful to future studies. Thus, we analyzed the sequence of E. faecalis OG1RF. This revealed approximately 232 kb encoding 227 open reading frames (ORFs) that are unique to this important strain compared to V583. The unique regions were then characterized further.
