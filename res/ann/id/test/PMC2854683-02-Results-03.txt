Multiple approaches to microarray analysis show statistically significant and biologically relevant differences between the WT and AP populations in vitro and in vivo 
To gain biologically relevant knowledge from the transcriptome studies without compromising statistical significance, we interrogated the data using multiple strategies that had been developed for microarray analysis and visualization, taking into consideration the strengths and limitations of each strategy. By clustering normalized expression values from different biological replicates in all data sets, we generated an overall "pathovivogram" that includes 276 genes in ten coexpression clusters, CCs (Fig. 2, Fig. S2, and Table S1). This pathovivogram highlights the transcriptional patterns that distinguish WT from AP bacteria regardless of their growth habitat (pathogram, Fig 2. CC4-CC6 and CC8-CC10), and the transcriptional patterns that are shared by WT-vitro and AP-vitro bacteria but that differentiate them from their corresponding in vivo samples (vivogram, Fig. 2, CC1-CC3). Moreover, we identified a unique cluster, CC7, that includes genes upregulated both in vivo and as a consequence of the covS mutation (e.g., those encoding M protein, streptolysin O, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (NADGH), Fig. 2, CC7). The patterns in clusters CC1-CC3 describe those gene sets whose transcription was turned on (CC1-CC2) or off (CC3) to drive the bacterial adaptation to the host environment, but are not primarily related to bacterial pathogenesis. Many of these genes encode metabolic enzymes (e.g., carbohydrate metabolism, arginine degradation, and pyrimidine biosynthesis), ribosomal proteins (mostly downregulated), and sugar or peptide transport systems, reflecting the transition from a carbohydrate-rich laboratory medium to a protein-rich, oxygen-poor subcutaneous tissue. Such transition is bound to have major downstream effects on the bacterial virulence gene expression [38], [39], [40]. While the expression patterns in clusters CC4, CC5, CC8, and CC9 match the previously described in vitro differences between WT and AP strains [10], [12], [13], [26], [27] (e.g., downregulation of SpeB, CAMP, and EndoS genes; upregulation of SpeA, SIC, and capsule genes), the combined comparative analysis of in vitro and in vivo samples revealed novel expression patterns exemplified by CC6 and CC10. These two clusters include genes whose expression has been repressed (CC6) or induced (CC10) by the AP mutation, but the repression or induction becomes observable only in vivo. For example, the expression of genes in the SLS and Trx operons is induced in vivo only in WT bacteria, but is mostly repressed in AP bacteria (Fig. 2, CC6) both in vitro and in vivo. Likewise, some genes are only induced in AP-vivo, including those encoding the toxin/enzyme streptokinase and a RofA/Nra-like transcriptional regulator (Fig. 2, CC10). Subsequent to the coexpression analysis, we calculated differential expression ratios between each pair of conditions (Table S2) at different statistical significance cutoffs, starting by the commonly used significance threshold of twofold ratio and P value <0.05, and moving to thresholds that are more conservative. At all significance cutoffs, the fewest observed transcriptional changes were those differentiating WT and AP bacteria in vitro compared to other pairs of conditions. By contrast, the most dramatic transcriptional reprogramming was that exhibited by the WT bacteria in their attempt to adapt to the in vivo environment (Table 2). Overall, at the least conservative statistical threshold (P<0.05), the transcription of 557 (23.9%) out of 2,329 genes probed in the microarrays was significantly perturbed (up or down, at one or more conditions, Fig. S3) and the only set of contiguous genes that underwent transcriptional changes at all tested conditions is the SpeB operon gene set (CC4 in Fig. 2). However, the fold-change in SpeB operon transcription level largely varied across the four experimental conditions, ranging from a 2.2-fold to a 30-fold downregulation (Table 3). Inspired by the recently described neighbor clustering method for microarray analysis [41], we also mapped the significant (P<0.05) differential expression ratios of different genes to their chromosomal loci (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4) to allow the visualization of coexpressed contiguous genes, including operons. This mapping highlighted genes that might otherwise have been overlooked by the CC or expression ratio methods. Examples of neighbor clusters (NCs) enriched in differentially expressed genes are a locus involved in L-ascorbate utilization (SPy0175-SPy0179); the citrate lyase locus (SPy1186-SPy1191); the Trx chromosomal locus (SPy1582-SPy1596) that includes the recently described, CovR-repressed two-component response regulator TrxR [42]; and the well-studied Mga (SPy2010-SPy2025), SpeB (SPy2037-SPy2042), and capsule synthesis (SPy2200-SPy2202) loci (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). NC analysis also allowed us to visualize genomic clusters that are similarly regulated in vitro and in vivo, and those that are reciprocally regulated. For example, in both the SLS operon and the Trx locus, we observed a striking difference between the effects of the covS mutation and the in vivo adaptation (Fig. 4, CC6). Genes of these two chromosomal clusters are significantly downregulated in AP compared to WT bacteria, but significantly upregulated in WT-vivo relative to WT-vitro conditions (Fig. 4, CC6). As a final step of our multifaceted data analysis approach, we tabulated significant transcriptional changes of individual genes that encode known regulators and well-studied virulence factors (Table 3). Focusing on those genes highlights the pathogenesis-related changes and allows easy comparison of our data with those in the literature [11], [12], [13], [16], [27], [37].
