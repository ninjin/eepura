In vivo virulent properties of the wild-type strain and mutant strains 
Murine intraperitoneal model of streptococcal infection was developed to compare the virulent properties of the strains under study. Mice were injected with 0.5 ml of PBS containing 108 CFUs and observed for 10 days. As seen from the Fig. 4, the mortality rate caused by sak189/sak188 double mutant strain significantly differed in comparison with that caused by the wild-type and sak188 mutant strains. Compared to the wild-type strain, the differences in virulent properties were statistically significant in case of sak189/sak188 double mutant strain (P-value <0.02), and not significant in case of sak188 mutant strain (P-value =0.73).
