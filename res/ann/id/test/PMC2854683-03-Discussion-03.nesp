<sentence id="0">Microarray validation and analysis</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although our microarray studies were extensive ( 28 arrays for 4 conditions ) , we ran qPCR to validate the microarray findings , focusing on virulence genes that are biomarkers of the bacterial switch to a hypervirulent phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These include SpeA , SpeB , Sda1 , M protein , and SIC [ data published in 14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Comparing the microarray data in this study with previously published work provides further validation of these results .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For example , the in vitro microarray results are consistent with our previous proteomic studies of the WT and AP secreted bacterial proteomes [ 12 ] as well as with other recently published studies of the in vitro transcriptome of closely related strains [ 13 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Importantly , we did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> base our analysis on single measurements of gene expression</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">nor</cue> did we focus on individual genes ; rather</scope> , we used gene expression data from biological replicates to rule out biological variability ( especially between bacteria recovered from different mice ) and to look for changes in gene clusters , operons , and pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In doing so , we were able to assess trends across experiments <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">rather than</cue> absolute numerical values that <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">could</cue> vary due to technical <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">rather than</cue> biological factors</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">believe</cue> that this approach provided more confidence in the final assessment of which genes/pathways were expressed similarly or differentially in both WT and AP bacteria in vitro and in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It also allowed us to dissect changes related to niche adaptation from those reflecting the selection of the fittest members of the bacterial community when faced with different environments and conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The use of multiple microarray analysis strategies and the integration of their results strengthened this study since each strategy has advantages and disadvantages .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">For example , coexpression clustering-one of the earliest developed microarray analysis tools [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] -provides an overall view of expression patterns of different genes , and greatly helps dissect and demonstrate the effect of each condition on the overall transcriptome .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , coexpression analysis alone can miss some biologically relevant genes that <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">could</cue> fail the statistical tests for non-biological reasons ( e.g. , poorly hybridizing probes , low signal-to-noise ratio , or high variance ) and <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> instead include some irrelevant genes in isolation of their biological networks [ 41</scope></scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In bacteria , biochemical pathways , virulence systems , and multimeric proteins are often encoded next to each other by chromosomally contiguous or clustered genes [ 64 ] , [ 65 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Analyzing coexpressed genes in the context of chromosomal clusters is thus most informative .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Indeed , neighbor clustering [ 41 ] has allowed the enrichment for contiguous gene sets and the prediction of more context-related expression patterns .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Genes in neighbor clusters could have been otherwise overlooked either because they were misannotated but their co-occurrence in known clusters revealed their importance , or because they did <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> pass the statistical tests</scope> but , since many bacterial transcripts are polycistronic , the expression of two or more members of a polycistron strongly <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggests</cue> that the whole operon is expressed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Besides these two clustering methods , expression ratios provided pairwise comparison , thereby allowing the quantification of the impact of each individual change of condition on overall gene expression ( Table 2 ) as well as on specific genes of interest ( Table 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">However , the use of ratios alone <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> be misleading , especially when they are calculated between two transcripts with low expression levels , resulting in spurious ratios of low biological significance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Similarly , the common use of statistical constraints with ratio calculation ( e.g. , two-fold ratios and P values < 0.05 ) filters out many biologically relevant genes that are true positives .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Finally , the use of operons , subsystems , and pathways to describe the array results avoids inappropriately building conclusions on the transcriptional changes of individual genes and thus better reflects biologically relevant perturbations in specific pathways .</sentence>
