Genes involved in virulence and secretion 
Identification of genes encoding hemolysin related proteins in P. temperata (fhaC) and X. koppenhoeferi (xhlA) may suggest their role in dealing with the insect cellular immune response and iron scavenge [31,32]. Subsequently, bacterial virulence factors actively contribute to a successful infection by colonization of and toxicity towards the insect host. Among the virulence genes identified in this study, tcaC was identified to be induced in both P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi during infection of R. majalis. The tca gene family encodes four toxin complexes TcaA, TcaB, TcaC and TcaD [33], and has been found in several bacterial pathogens including P. luminescens, Yersinia and Xenorhabdus [34]. Interestingly, Tca toxin encoding genes were also found to be induced in a related species P. luminescens treated with the homogenate of G. mellonella [16]. This leads us to speculate that TcaC serves as either an activator or a chaperone in secretion of toxin complex from the cell as proposed by ffrench-Constant et al. [35] and Waterfield et al. [36]. Induction of gene pplA, encoding a phospholipase, in P. temperata is expected to contribute to its faster growth rate [37] compared to X. koppenhoeferi in R. majalis. Further, genes encoding components of different types of secretion machineries were isolated in this study. Upregulation of gene sctL, encoding components of type III secretion machinery, possibly coordinates protein secretion system in P. temperata for translocating effector molecules across the bacterial cell envelope into host cells [38-40]. Unlike Photorhabdus, the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do not encode homologues of a dedicated type III secretion system [3], indicating that Xenorhabdus likely uses different effectors or secretion systems. Notably, in X. koppenhoeferi, virH with sequence similarity to a gene encoding putative toxin secretion transporter in Vibrio cholera, was upregulated during infection of R. majalis. In addition, several other genes encoding proteins with putative virulence functions identified in this study may represent novel toxin candidates involved in insect infection. These include pmt1, toxC and virB from P. temperata, and virH from X. koppenhoeferi. Differences in expression of virulence and secretion related genes imply the differential virulence mechanisms employed by the two bacteria.
