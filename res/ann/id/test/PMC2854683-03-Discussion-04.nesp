<sentence id="0">The bigger picture : niche adaptation and the evolution of hypervirulence in S. pyogenes</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Having used multiple strategies and integrated the PM data with the in vitro and in vivo microarray data , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> the following hypotheses about streptococcal niche adaptation and switch to hypervirulence</scope> : ( 1 ) Exposure to the in vivo environment perturbs a substantial number of GAS genes and regulatory networks .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This has been demonstrated by the larger number of genes affected during in vivo adaptation of both M1T1 variants compared to those affected by the covS mutation ( Table 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , many of the genes modulated in vivo <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">seem</cue> to be involved in metabolic reprogramming and stress responses <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> pathoadaptation and virulence</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This is why we <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">believe</cue> that transcriptional reprogramming by environmental adaptation alone was insufficient to provide WT bacteria with an in vivo survival advantage</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In fact , WT bacteria underwent the most dramatic in vivo transcriptional reprogramming ( Table 2 ) ; yet , they failed to survive since after five to seven days post-infection , they became extinct , and only AP bacteria could be isolated from the mice chambers [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">( 2 ) <scope type="spec" id="4"> The covS mutation in AP bacteria <cue type="spec" id="4">seems</cue> to be preferentially modulating virulence mechanisms</scope> , as about 25 % of the known genes perturbed by the mutation belong to virulence subsystems ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">5 ) and many of the other perturbed genes are indirectly associated with virulence ( e.g. , carbohydrate metabolism [ 66 ] and arginine utilization proteins [ 38 ] ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , the pathoadaptive clusters ( CC4-CC10 in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">2 ) are more enriched in virulence-related genes than the clusters involved in in vivo adaption ( CC1-CC3 in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This finding <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggests</cue> that AP bacteria are somehow " pre-adapted " to invasiveness and , consequently , when injected into mice</scope> , they do <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> undergo much virulence-related changes</scope> as they already possess a thicker capsule , lack a functional SpeB , are equipped with surface virulence proteins , and secrete ready-to-use toxins , including the potent DNase , Sda1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">However , the degree of AP invasiveness <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">might</cue> vary depending on the route of infection and animal model [ 15 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">It is noteworthy that SpeB expression has a dominant effect , since even if secreted in low amounts by a minor subpopulation , this broad-spectrum protease <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">would</cue> still be able to degrade , fully or partially , many GAS virulence proteins , including Sda1 , thereby rendering the bacteria vulnerable to different effector mechanisms of the host 's innate immune system including neutrophil killing [ 14 ] , [ 67 ] , [ 68</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Thus , a complete shutdown of proteolytically active SpeB is essential to preserve effective extracellular virulence factors [ 15 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">This dominant SpeB effect <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> explain why WT bacteria parish in vivo even though they partially downregulate SpeB transcription ( Table 3 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">( 3 ) The GAS genome has at least 13 two-component regulatory systems [ 69 ] in addition to several stand-alone transcriptional regulators [ 47 ] , [ 70 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">However , the CovRS system is a major player , among these regulators , in driving the bacterial adaptation to the host 's environment and regulating virulence directly <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">or</cue> through other downstream regulators [ 20 ] , [ 54</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">It is thus counterintuitive that bacteria lacking the important environmental sensor , CovS , would prevail in one of the most stressful environments .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">However , losing this sensor <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">might</cue> be the last resort for these bacteria stranded away from their primary niche and surrounded by hostile immune cells and proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">From an evolutionary point of view , it is <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">possible</cue> to <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">speculate</cue> that the bacteria lose their danger sensor to keep their " weapons " constitutively expressed and fight to survive when escape is <scope type="neg" id="12"><cue type="neg" id="12">not</cue> an option</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Such mutation is <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">likely</cue> detrimental to the bacterial long-term survival and dissemination via colonization of new hosts [ 71</scope> ] , as they need a WT sensor for better adaptability [ 72 ] ( e.g. , in less hostile niches like throat or saliva [ 26 ] ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">An intact CovRS system <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">would</cue> offer the bacteria enough versatility to turn on and off many regulatory networks through CovS signaling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">This flexible mechanism allows the bacteria to initially hide from the immune system through SpeB-driven camouflaging , i.e. degradation of most of their immunogenic virulence factors [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">( 4 ) We also show that the impact of the covS mutation goes beyond the defined CovR regulon .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">This finding is in accordance with previous observations that CovR and CovS are <scope type="neg" id="17"><cue type="neg" id="17">not</cue> committed to each other</scope> , as CovR could be phosphorylated in the <scope type="neg" id="18"><cue type="neg" id="18">absence</cue> of a functional CovS</scope> [ 22 ] and as different covS mutations , albeit clustered in the histidine kinase domain , <scope type="spec" id="19"> <cue type="spec" id="19">might</cue> have different transcriptional effects [ 27 ] , including opposite effects on different members of the CovR regulon [ 26</scope> ] .</sentence>
