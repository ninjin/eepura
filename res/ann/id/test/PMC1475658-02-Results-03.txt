The aprA Mutant Retains the Capacity to Trigger an Immune Response and to Induce Food-Uptake Cessation 
In addition to its pathogenicity, P. entomophila infection provokes a food-uptake cessation in larvae and triggers an immune response in both larvae and adults [9]. Feeding of larvae with medium containing bromophenol blue, leads to a clearly visible food uptake, discernable by blue coloration throughout the gut. In contrast, P. entomophila-infected larvae show only a pale blue coloration indicating that infected larvae cease to ingest food. Whereas this food-uptake cessation was still observed in aprA and prtR mutants, it was not evident in gacA mutant-infected larvae (Figure 2D and data not shown for prtR). The kinetics of the expression of the AMP, Diptericin, in larvae and adults after natural infection by P. entomophila and its derivative mutants, was analyzed by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Diptericin was expressed at a wild-type level following oral infection with the aprA and prtR mutants, but no expression was detected in the case of the gacA mutant (Figures 2C and 5A). Observation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence in infected larvae carrying a Diptericin-GFP reporter gene confirmed that prtR and aprA mutants elicited an immune response, whereas gacA mutants failed to do so (unpublished data). The data presented above clearly indicate that AprA is a major virulence factor of P. entomophila that promotes bacterial persistence and killing of the host, but that other virulence factors controlled by gacA and prtR exist. It also reveals that P. entomophila virulence is multi-factorial with a clear distinction between factors that promote pathogenicity and those that trigger the immune response. The observation that both factors are under the control of the GacS/GacA, confirmed that this two-component system is the master regulator of P. entomophila virulence.
