Conclusion 
E. faecalis OG1RF carries a number of unique loci compared to V583. Those of particular interest include new surface proteins (MSCRAMMs and WxL domain proteins), an operon encoding myo-inositol utilization, an intact competence operon, and two CRISPR elements. The CRISPR elements may be of particular significance when one considers that most of what is missing from OG1RF compared to V583 consists of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including 6 phages or remnants thereof. The presence of the CRISPR elements in OG1RF provides a tantalizing, but as yet unproven, explanation for the discordance in the number of mobile elements between these two strains. The acquisition of MGE is believed to be an important mechanism by which the species E. faecalis had been able to generate genetic diversity and, thereby, highly variable phenotypes [4]. It has been proposed that the ability of E. faecalis to cause healthcare related infections is associated with these MGEs [4,5]. This hypothesis was supported by several studies that have highlighted the importance of virulence determinants carried by these mobile elements, such as cytolysin [57] by the PAI. However, more recent results from Aakra et al. [53] and Lepage et al. [36] demonstrate that these factors may be present in harmless strains while absent in clinical isolates, indicating that E. faecalis virulence is not dependent on any single virulence factor. Indeed, few studies have compared the virulence pattern of strains from various origins. The increased ability of OG1RF to infect kidneys and to produce biofilm, despite the absence of MGEs and their associated virulence factors, was surprising. Different possibilities can be proposed relating to the factors important for these differences in enterococcal infections. One of these is that virulence in the assays used may be linked to the shared core genome of these two strains, with the differences arising from the unique genes. On the other hand, virulence could be associated primarily with the genes unique to each strain, but with each set being able to complement the absence of the other. It seems most likely that virulence, and/or some combination of virulence and fitness, is caused by the expression of a mixture of both the core and unique genes. It is also important to remember that E. faecalis is a well adapted commensal, carrying the genes necessary to survive and to colonize the gut, and that a subset, particularly MLST CC2 and CC9 [58], predominates among hospital acquired infections. It may be that these clonal complexes are not more virulent per se, as defined in the assays described here, but rather are better able to survive and/or colonize hospitalized patients, taking advantage of factors that predispose to nosocomial infections such as urinary or venous catheters, or mucositis, among others. Sequencing of more E. faecalis strains may facilitate our understanding of the path from commensalism to pathogenicity, a crucial prerequisite for designing therapeutic interventions directed to control an organism that is already resistant to a large spectrum of antibiotics.
