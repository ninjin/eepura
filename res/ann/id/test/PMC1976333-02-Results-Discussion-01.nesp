<sentence id="1">Mapping Phenotype to Genotype Using Microarray-Based Genetic Footprinting Traditional methods of genetic investigation have been extremely successful in providing a deep molecular understanding of many phenotypes in model microorganisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , faced with literally thousands of important and mostly uncharacterized bacterial species , we need entirely novel methods of genetic functional analysis and pathway elucidation that scale to the task at hand .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we have applied a systematic genome-wide strategy to determine the contribution of nearly all genetic loci in the genome to a phenotype of interest .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our approach combines genetic footprinting [ 13 ] with microarray hybridization [ 14 ] in order to monitor , in parallel , the relative abundances of transposon-mutagenized cells throughout a competitive selection experiment [ 12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Saturation transposon mutagenesis is a powerful , versatile , and efficient strategy for creating comprehensive mutant libraries for genomic functional characterization [ 15 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have used a hyperactive Tn5 transposition system with reduced target specificity [ 16 ] to create a library of approximately 5 x 105 independent transposon insertional mutants in E. coli MG1655 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Given the reduced target specificity and a genome of approximately 4,300 genes , the mutagenesis of our library is saturating with an average of approximately100 independent insertions within each open reading frame ( ORF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In each of our experiments , a population of mutants is challenged for competitive growth under a selection of interest .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Each mutant within the population is uniquely defined by the local sequence flanking the transposon insertion site .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The series of molecular manipulations detailed in Figure S1 allow the amplification of roughly 200 base pairs flanking each transposon insertion site in a population in parallel .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Fluorescent labeling and hybridization of the amplicons to a spotted DNA microarray ( created as described in Protocol S1 ) reveal the relative abundance of each mutant as reflected by the signal intensity of the corresponding ORF on the array .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">As a consequence of selection , individual insertional mutants can increase or decrease in abundance during the course of an experiment , and these relative changes can be monitored by comparing genome-wide hybridization values before and after selection .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In a proof-of-principle analysis of the unselected transposon library , we show that the hybridization intensities corresponding to known essential genes are strongly biased towards the lowest values , consistent with their inability to harbor transposon insertions ( Figure S2 ) .</sentence>
