Virulence and biofilm comparisons of OG1RF with V583 
When compared in the mouse peritonitis model, the LD50 values of V583 in different determinations were lower (4.8 x 107 to 1.1 x 108 colony forming units (CFU)/ml) than the LD50 values of OG1RF (1.2 x 108 to 4.8 x 108 CFU/ml). However, at comparable inoculum, OG1RF (4 x 108 CFU/ml) showed more rapid mortality versus V583 (5 x 108 CFU/ml) in the first 48 hours (P = 0.0034; Additional data file 3). In a urinary tract infection model administering mixed equal inocula of V583 and OG1RF, OG1RF significantly outnumbered V583 in kidney with geometric means of 1.3 x 104 CFU/gm for OG1RF versus 1.9 x 102 CFU/gm for V583 (P = 0.0005); in urinary bladder homogenates, the geometric mean CFU/gm was 1.7 x 103 for OG1RF versus 6.6 x 101 for V583 (P = 0.003; Figure 7a). Similarly, in mono-infection, the geometric mean CFU/gm of OG1RF in kidneys was 9.4 x 103 versus 4 x 101 for V583 (P = 0.0035; Figure 7b). We also found that OG1RF produced 20% more biofilm (P < 0.01) than V583 at 24 hours (results not shown). These results, together with the previous results in C. elegans [17], demonstrate that OG1RF, although lacking what was thought to be important for virulence (PAI, plasmids, prophages), is as pathogenic as V583 in at least three assays.
