<sentence id="0">Identification of Photorhabdus temperata or Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi specific genes</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To identify genes that were distinctive in P. temperata or X. koppenhoeferi genome <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> exclusively induced in one or the other bacterium , comparative hybridization was performed based upon the identified genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Twenty nine of the 40 distinct P. temperata transcripts have similar sequences in X. koppenhoeferi genome , thus 11 were P. temperata specific ; 30 of the 39 distinct X. koppenhoeferi transcripts share sequence similarity with P. temperata genome , thus 9 were specific to X. koppenhoeferi ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although these 59 transcripts ( 29 + 30 ) corresponding to genes present in the genome of both bacteria , 21 from P. temperata and 22 from X. koppenhoeferi were identified to be exclusively induced in each of them .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Only a small number of transcripts were induced in both bacteria , and most of them corresponded to genes required for stress response .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , the level of changes in the transcripts exclusively induced in one or the other bacterium during infection of R. majalis was determined by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) on following representative genes : cysK , def , dnaB , lysR , pchC , pckA , phoP , ptst1 , sctL , selD , tolB and virB from P. temperata , and aceK , clpP , cobJ , dacC , dld , malF , res , rtxC , tilS , virH , xhlA , and xkst4 from X. koppenhoeferi .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">qRT-PCR results displayed consistence with the SCOTS assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Most tested genes displayed 6-16 fold induction in qRT-PCR assays , and a few genes including sctL , phoP , rtxC and clpP exhibited about 3-fold induction ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">4 ) .</sentence>
