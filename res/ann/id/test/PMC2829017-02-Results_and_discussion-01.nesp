<sentence id="1">Animal samples While working with samples from commercial herds means that we are working with disease cases that are representative of what is really happening in the field , it also means that limited amounts of material is available .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">During the course of our experiments , we were able to collect samples from three different animals from the same herd , before antibiotherapy was undertaken to eradicate the infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">All the animals that were sampled had presented symptoms of the disease for less than 24 h. Two animals died as a result of the infection , and were sampled a few hours after death .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="0">Those samples were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> used for the microarray experiments since significant transcriptomic changes <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> have occurred between the time of death and the time of sampling</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , preliminary microscopic observations were made and our RNA extraction protocol was tested with those samples .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The last animal was euthanized on site by a veterinarian , and sampled less than 5 minutes after death .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The infectious field strain was isolated from this animal .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">While it can be argued that different animals <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> react differently to an infection by A. pleuropneumoniae</scope> , and therefore elicit different transcriptional changes in the pathogen , we are confident that the results that were obtained reflect accurately the conditions encountered by A. pleuropneumoniae in its natural host following acute infection .</sentence>
