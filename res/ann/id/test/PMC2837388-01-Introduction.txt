Introduction 
Precise gene regulation is crucial to the successful activation and execution of virulence programs for all pathogenic organisms. The acquisition of genes through horizontal gene transfer, a widespread means of bacterial evolution [1], requires a process to integrate new coding sequence into pre-existing regulatory circuitry. Silencing of horizontally-acquired genes by DNA binding proteins like H-NS is one way some incoming genes are initially controlled [2],[3], which can then be subject to regulatory evolution by mutating cis-regulatory operator regions to select for optional gene expression. The eventual promoter architecture selected to deploy virulence genes is often modular and should reflect a design that maximizes organismal fitness while limiting fitness trade-offs and antagonistic pleiotropy [4]. Both simulated [5] and functional experiments [6],[7] show that mutation of cis-regulatory sequences can be rapid, and that plasticity - the degree to which regulatory mutation can perturb the larger gene network - can be well tolerated in bacterial systems. Promoter architectures that control quantitative traits such as bacterial virulence are, in fact, modular and evolvable [8]. For instance, Salmonella enterica has a multi-faceted pathogenic strategy fine-tuned by several transcriptional regulators. Intracellular survival and persistence of Salmonella requires a type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded in a horizontally-acquired genomic island called Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-2 (SPI-2) [9],[10]. T3SS are complex secretion machines that deliver bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells through an injectisome during infection [11],[12]. Several ancestral regulators control the genes in the SPI-2 genomic island including the two-component systems EnvZ-OmpR and PhoQ-PhoP, and the regulatory protein SlyA [13]. SsrA-SsrB is another two-component regulatory system co-inherited by genetic linkage with the SPI-2 locus that is essential for gene expression in SPI-2 [14]-[16]. SsrA is a sensor kinase activated in the host environment that phosphorylates the SsrB response regulator to create an active transcription factor needed for spatiotemporal control of virulence genes [13],[17]. In the Salmonella genus, the SPI-2 genomic island is found only in pathogenic serotypes of Salmonella enterica that infect warm-blooded animals and is absent from Salmonella bongori, which colonizes cold-blooded animals [18]. It is generally accepted that SPI-2 was acquired by Salmonella enterica after divergence from S. bongori, providing a useful pedigree to study regulatory evolution influenced by SsrB. We recently demonstrated the evolutionary significance of cis-regulatory mutations for pathoadaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) to an animal host [19]. Our focus was on SsrB because of its broad conservation among the pathogenic Salmonellae and its essentiality for animal infection, suggesting it coordinates fundamental aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis beyond the SPI-2 genomic island. In this study we investigated how regulatory evolution assimilates horizontally acquired and ancestral genes into the SsrB regulon on a genome-wide scale using an integrated set of experimental methods. Combining our data with previous biochemical work, along with comparative genomic analyses with an orthologous T3SS-encoding genomic island in the tsetse fly endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, we reveal the flexible DNA palindrome that distributes SsrB in the genome to influence transcriptional activation of the SPI-2 T3SS and almost all of its accessory effector proteins. Our data uncovers the principal SsrB circuitry that appears to have been conserved to support multiple bacterial lifestyles, including parasitic and mutualist symbioses.
