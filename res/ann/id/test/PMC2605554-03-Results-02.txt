Repair of the 5628 ropB allele restores SpeB expression and activity 
Western blot detected SpeB in overnight culture supernatants of 5628R+, containing the intact ropB allele, but not in the clinical isolate 5628 nor the isogenic mutant 5628RDeltaSpeB, containing the intact ropB allele but lacking speB (Fig. 1B). This expression correlated with a restoration of extracellular protease activity as detected by azocasein degradation assay (Fig. 1C). Protease activity was abrogated by the addition of the cysteine protease inhibitor E64. These data demonstrated that the ropB point mutation was indeed responsible for the lack of SpeB expression in the clinical isolate 5628.
