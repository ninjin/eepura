<sentence id="0">Limited presence of mobile elements</sentence>
<sentence id="1">By probing a microarray of the V583 genome and plasmids with OG1RF genomic DNA , we previously estimated that only 75 % of V583 ORFs were also present in OG1RF [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Later , Aakra et al. [ 53 ] compared nine strains , including OG1RF to V583 , using comparative genomic hybridization .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In these results , <scope type="spec" id="0"> OG1RF <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to carry a few genes included in the PAI , and a few prophage genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using the complete genome sequence , we have now found that OG1RF <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> 639 genes and the three pTET plasmids described in V583</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">All but 45 of the missing genes are associated with <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> mobile elements , such as the entire PAI</scope> , the recently described phages 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 [ 31 ] , and the approximately 111 kb area between genes EF2240 and EF2351 ( including the vanB transposon ) present in V583 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The absence of these elements appears also to be a characteristic of the commensal strain Symbioflor 1 , although because the genome was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> completely finished</scope> , the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possibility</cue> remains that <scope type="neg" id="4">some of these regions were <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> sequenced</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In conclusion , other than the approximately 49 kb fragment containing a Tn916 homologue , it <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">appears</cue> that OG1RF has only one additional <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">possible</cue> mobile element derivative</scope> , namely the phage 2 proposed to be part of the core genome [ 31 ]</scope> .</sentence>
