<sentence id="0">The Genetic Basis of Environmentally Induced Repression of Motility</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chemotaxis in E. coli is strongly inhibited by environmental conditions such as high temperature , low pH , and high osmolarity [ 62-64 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Some of these environmental influences <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be due to direct physicochemical perturbations to chemotaxis or flagellar function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Alternatively , these signals <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> provide crucial information about the cell 's local environment , influencing chemotactic behavior through upstream regulatory pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Consistent with this picture , the promoter of the flhDC operon , the master regulator of flagellar gene expression , is one of the most highly regulated loci in the genome and contains many transcription-factor binding sites [ 65 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We devised a simple selection strategy to identify the genetic loci that contribute to environmentally induced variation in chemotactic behavior .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We focused on inhibition of motility by high osmolarity ( 0.5 M NaCl ) , since previous evidence <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that this environmental condition signals to the flhDC regulatory region [ 66</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We reasoned that null mutations in components of such upstream signaling pathways <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">would</cue> alleviate repression of chemotaxis under high [ NaCl ] conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">According to this model , the transposon insertion library <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">should</cue> harbor mutants that perform chemotaxis in high [ NaCl ] as well as wild-type cells do under low [ NaCl ] conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">As can be seen in Figure S12A , this is in fact what we observe since , during the same time interval , some members from the transposon mutant library travel significantly further away from the site of inoculation than do the homogeneous population of wild-type cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In order to identify the mutations associated with the observed alleviation in suppression of motility under high [ NaCl ] , we extracted the population of mutants that traveled to the extreme edge of the chemotaxis front .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Microarray-based genetic footprinting of these mutants provided quantitative genome-wide readout of the population ( Dataset S13 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The selection results revealed that mutants harboring insertions in five genes ( ompR , envZ , znuA , znuC , and yfiM ) were the most abundant .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The microarray results were confirmed by showing that individual strains with mutations in these genes showed increased motility in high [ NaCl ] relative to the wild-type strain ( Figure S12B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">OmpR and EnvZ are well-characterized members of the two-component osmoregulatory system ( Figure S12C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">EnvZ is the sensor kinase that phosphorylates OmpR , a DNA-binding regulatory protein , under conditions of high osmolarity [ 67 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Our finding that the EnvZ/OmpR signaling pathway mediates motility suppression in high [ NaCl ] is consistent with previous work that found phosphorylated OmpR to negatively regulate the expression of flagella by interacting with the promoter region of flhDC [ 66 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">ZnuA and ZnuC are part of a high-affinity zinc uptake system .</sentence>
<sentence id="18"><scope type="spec" id="5"> The role of yfiM , a novel uncharacterized gene that shows sequence similarity to a lipoprotein , is <cue type="spec" id="5">not clear</cue> at this point</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Ongoing work will determine how the gene products of yfiM , znuA , and znuC contribute to this signaling pathway , either through Envz/OmpR or through a parallel pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">We have shown that the limits on swimming motility under nominally extreme conditions can be regulated by " interpretation " of environmental signals rather than by hard physicochemical constraints on energy generation or mechanics .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">This argues for a more nuanced perspective on the functional constraints influencing bacterial behavior in general-including the strong coupling between behavior and environment-and an appreciation of the rich ecological context that has shaped bacterial behavior on geological time scales .</sentence>
