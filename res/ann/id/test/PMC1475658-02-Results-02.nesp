<sentence id="0">The P. entomophila aprA Mutant Displays Attenuated Pathogenicity</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The experiments described above <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that AprA plays an important in vivo role in P. entomophila virulence</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To further test this hypothesis , we used a genetic approach by inactivating the aprA gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Sequence analysis of the locus corresponding to aprA revealed a genetic organization characteristic of this class of Type I-secreted proteases [ 14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The structural gene for the metalloprotease , aprA , is followed by a gene encoding its periplasmic inhibitor , aprI , and three genes encoding the Type I transporter , aprD , E , and F ( Figure 2A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Studies in other bacteria have shown that AprD , E , and F participate in the elaboration of a Type I transporter required for AprA secretion to the external medium [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We inactivated the aprA gene by inserting a tetracycline resistance cassette by a double homologous recombination event .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">SDS-PAGE protein profiles of culture supernatants clearly demonstrated the absence of the 51-kDa band , and in vitro protease activity of the aprA mutant confirmed the concomitant absence of secreted protease activity ( Figure 1C , lane 6 , and 1F ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">To analyze the in vivo contribution of AprA to P. entomophila virulence , we performed a survival analysis of Drosophila larvae and adults after oral infection with various P. entomophila derivatives .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Only 40 % of the aprA-infected larvae succumbed within 3 days , while 70 % of the larvae died after infection with wild-type P. entomophila , demonstrating that the aprA mutant was attenuated for virulence ( Figure 2B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Similarly , the aprA mutant showed reduced pathogenicity after oral infection of adult flies ( Figure S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Using the same assay , both prtR and gacA mutants were almost avirulent toward Drosophila <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> both genes regulate other virulence factors in addition to AprA ( Figure 2B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We next compared persistence of wild-type P. entomophila and the aprA mutant by quantifying the number of bacteria in larvae and adults at different time points after infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Whereas the wild-type P. entomophila titer remained high , aprA bacterial levels decreased significantly with time ( Figure 3A , not shown for larvae ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">However , aprA gut persistence remained higher than that of gacA mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">We could not exclude that the aprA mutant phenotype was due to polar effects of the insertion in the operon upon expression of apr I , D , E , and F. In support of this <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesis</cue> , previous studies have demonstrated for both Serratia marcescens and P. fluorescens that Type I transporters can be polyvalent and secrete different types of proteins such as proteases and lipases [ 18,19 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Complementation of the aprA mutant with the wild-type apr operon restored protease secretion and activity ( Figure 1C , lane 7 , and 1F ) and resulted in a complete regain of function with respect to all virulence phenotypes ( Figures 2B and S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In contrast , no rescue was observed with a plasmid containing the full apr operon but carrying a non-polar mutation in aprA ( Figures 2B and S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">These data confirmed that the protease AprA itself contributes to P. entomophila virulence .</sentence>
