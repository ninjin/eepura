Results 
Phenotype Microarrays show no major nutritional or metabolic differences between wild type and animal-passaged, hypervirulent M1T1 GAS We used Biolog(R) Phenotype Microarrays (PM) to screen 1900 different growth conditions, including a large set of different carbon and nitrogen sources, pH values and salt concentrations, as well as different concentrations of various antimicrobial agents (Fig. S1), and found that both WT and AP GAS have similar growth requirements in vitro with minor differences. For example, AP bacteria grew better than WT bacteria in the presence of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid, and were more sensitive to four antimicrobials (out of 373 screened in PM), including the calcium-specific metal chelator EGTA, the lipophilic chelator 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline, and the antibiotics tobramycin and cefotaxime (Table 1). However, when both bacterial variants were grown at 37degreesC in the enriched Todd Hewitt broth medium, their growth rates were indistinguishable, and the only detectable difference was that AP bacteria were more buoyant in liquid culture compared to WT. This difference in buoyancy can be attributed to differences in proteolytic activity (WT >> AP) that may degrade many surface proteins, including pilin, or induce changes in the surface charge making bacterial aggregates more compact. The difference in buoyancy can also be attributed to differences in the expression of hyaluronic acid capsule (AP > WT). Although the PM results confirm previous experiments [16] showing a few minor differences between WT and AP bacteria in vitro, this technology is limited because it uses minimal media and measures microbial respiration as a growth indicator (http://www.biolog.com). Minimal media are not optimal for the expression of GAS proteins, which may explain why GAS failed to grow at many of the PM conditions (Fig. S1) and why fewer phenotypic differences were observed between WT and AP bacteria than transcriptomic differences (see below).
