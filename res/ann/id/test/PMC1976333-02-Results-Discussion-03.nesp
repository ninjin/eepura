<sentence id="0">Genetic Basis of Swimming Motility and Chemotaxis</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Semi-solid tryptone agar provides a robust setting for studying E. coli chemotaxis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Once inoculated into a region of the soft agar , bacteria deplete local nutrients and chemotax radially outward following the concentration gradient of preferred substrates [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To systematically and completely identify the genetic determinants for swimming motility , approximately107 cells of the mutant library were functionally enriched en masse for an impaired ability to swim through soft agar .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After an 8-h incubation to allow motile cells to swim away from the site of inoculation , the population enriched for nonmotile mutants was transferred to a fresh plate for further enrichment ( Figure 1A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The percentage of nonmotile mutants was determined after each stage of enrichment by a clonal plating assay and , after five stages , 96 % of the mutants showed an impaired ability to swim ( Figure S3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The amplification of transposon insertion sites from a small sample of these mutants showed that the nonmotile phenotype is the result of a single gene disruption in each mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As expected , the vast majority of these disruptions occurred in previously known flagellar or chemotaxis genes ( Table S3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , even in this small sample , we found transposon insertions in genes <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> a previously known role in motility</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">To obtain a genome-wide catalog of loci involved in swimming motility , we applied our microarray-based genetic footprinting assay to the population of mutants at the end of the enrichments .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The z-scores reveal that the vast majority of ORFs lie within a tight Gaussian-shaped distribution centered around zero ( Figure 1B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , of the 115 ORFs with z-scores greater than 12 , 49 are known flagellar and chemotaxis genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Since the microarray contained 52 out of the total of 54 known motility genes [ 18 ] , the chance likelihood of observing this level of enrichment was extremely low ( p < 10-76 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The three remaining motility genes that were not significantly enriched are two chemoreceptor genes , trg and aer , and the filament cap chaperone , fliT .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Based on the hybridization results , insertional mutations in these genes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">should</cue> <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> measurably impair motility</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">We confirmed this expectation by showing that deletions of fliT and aer did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affect motility <scope type="neg" id="4">( data <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">The neutral behavior of the fliT mutation is <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> surprising</scope> since fliT null strains were found to make functional flagella in S. enterica [ 19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In addition , it has been reported that fliT mutations enhance expression of class 2 flagellar operons [ 20 ] because FliT acts as a negative regulator of these operons by binding to and inhibiting the activity of FlhDC [ 21 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">The protein encoded by aer mediates oxygen and redox sensing , and as such shares overlapping function with the Tsr receptor [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Because of this redundancy , only aer tsr double mutants are expected to show a motility phenotype in tryptone plates .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Finally , the product of trg is a transmembrane methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein that senses ribose and galactose [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Although these sugars are absent from tryptone plates , deletion of trg did result in a measurable motility defect ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">Therefore , of the more than 50 known genes involved , trg is the only false negative under the motility conditions we used .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Remarkably , the selection results revealed many genes with high z-scores <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">without</cue> a previously known role in motility</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">We were concerned that some marginally high z-scores <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be due to " hitchhiking " of spontaneously arising mutations in motility genes on the background of transposon insertions in nonessential genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">To minimize such false positives , we demanded that a candidate motility gene obtain a z-score above 12 in at least two of the three replicate selections ( Datasets S2 , S3 , and S4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">The 40 candidate genes that fit these criteria were targeted for deletion , and 20 of them were found to show a significant defect in swimming motility ( Figure 1C ; Table S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">We observed that some false positives were indeed due to hitchhiking , but others were due to polar effects of transposon insertions on downstream genes within operons .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">Additionally , <scope type="spec" id="8"> some genes <cue type="spec" id="8">may</cue> be deemed false positive because the nature of the mutation caused by transposon insertion cannot be replicated by a clean deletion of the gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">The criteria we used for identifying candidate motility genes favored sensitivity ( essentially 100 % ) over specificity .</sentence>
<sentence id="30">However , the number of false positives can be driven lower by decreasing the cycles of selection , increasing the number of replicates , or by focusing on genes with relatively high z-scores .</sentence>
<sentence id="31">In the sections that follow , we explore the manner in which the validated newly identified genes affect motility .</sentence>
