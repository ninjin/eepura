<sentence id="1">Construction and growth characteristics of mutant and wildtype Salmonella Typhimurium strains Hfq and SmpB are essential for virulence in a variety of pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella Typhimurium [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To address the role of Hfq and SmpB in Salmonella Typhimurium pathogenesis and protein synthesis we first constructed non-polar deletion mutations of the hfq and smpB genes using a modified pKD13 derivative as the template .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this method [ 28 ] , the coding region between the initiation methionine and the last seven amino acids of the gene was replaced with an inframe " scar " sequence that does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> contain any stop codons</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Functional disruption of the hfq and smpB mutant derivatives was first confirmed by PCR analysis after which the mutants were P22 transduced to a new genetic background to avoid the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibility</cue> of secondary mutations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutants that <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacked</cue> either of these proteins</scope> showed impaired growth phenotype in acidic minimal media ( AMM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The hfq-deficient strain also exhibited decreased growth rate in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth ( Figure S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> SmpB and Hfq are involved in broad cellular functions , including growth rate regulation</scope> .</sentence>
