Results and Discussion 
Construction and growth characteristics of mutant and wildtype Salmonella Typhimurium strains Hfq and SmpB are essential for virulence in a variety of pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella Typhimurium [20], [21], [22], [25]. To address the role of Hfq and SmpB in Salmonella Typhimurium pathogenesis and protein synthesis we first constructed non-polar deletion mutations of the hfq and smpB genes using a modified pKD13 derivative as the template. In this method [28], the coding region between the initiation methionine and the last seven amino acids of the gene was replaced with an inframe "scar" sequence that does not contain any stop codons. Functional disruption of the hfq and smpB mutant derivatives was first confirmed by PCR analysis after which the mutants were P22 transduced to a new genetic background to avoid the possibility of secondary mutations. Mutants that lacked either of these proteins showed impaired growth phenotype in acidic minimal media (AMM). The hfq-deficient strain also exhibited decreased growth rate in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Figure S1). These results suggest SmpB and Hfq are involved in broad cellular functions, including growth rate regulation.
