<sentence id="1">P. entomophila Secretes an Abundant Protease A common strategy used by bacterial pathogens is to secrete toxins and other virulence factors that damage host tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To test <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> P. entomophila <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> secrete such toxic factors</scope></scope> , a supernatant filtrate from a bacterial culture was tested for its ability to kill Drosophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Figure 1A shows that a concentrated P. entomophila culture filtrate had a moderate but significant effect on Drosophila larvae survival following ingestion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although the filtrate did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> kill adult flies after feeding</scope> ( unpublished data ) , it was highly toxic by direct injection into the hemocoel ( Figure 1B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">No</cue> killing of either larvae or adults was observed with a culture filtrate derived from the avirulent P. entomophila strain carrying a Tn5 transposon in the gacA gene</scope> [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggested</cue> that P. entomophila secreted one or more factors with toxic activity under the control of the GacS/GacA two-component system</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In an attempt to identify the factor(s) responsible for toxicity , we analyzed the proteins present in the supernatant .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The protein profile for wild-type P. entomophila supernantant ( Figure 1C , lane 2 ) shows a major protein band at 51 kDa and several minor bands .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic fragments of the 51-kDa band identified this protein as a homolog of the previously characterized Apr proteases from Pseudomonas spp. , Prt proteases from Erwinia spp .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">and Photorhabdus spp. , and serralysins from Serratia spp .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">[ 12-14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">All of these proteases are members of the zinc metzincin family of Type I-secreted RTX proteins [ 15 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">We subsequently purified this protease , termed AprA , to homogeneity from the P. entomophila supernatant by anion exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 1D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Injection of pure AprA into the hemocoel rapidly killed adult flies , identifying this protein as a bacterial toxin ( Figure 1E ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Feeding of larvae with high concentrations ( 1.5 mg/ml ) of AprA led to modest lethality ( unpublished data ) , recapitulating the properties of the P. entomophila supernatant .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Interestingly , in a gacA mutant the number of proteins in the supernatant was greatly reduced , including the complete absence of the 51-kDa band corresponding to AprA ( Figure 1C , lane 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In P. fluorescens , membrane-localized anti-sigma factor PrtR cleaves the extracytoplasmic sigma factor PrtI , resulting in increased expression of multiple genes , including one encoding for a metalloprotease , aprX [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Two independent Tn5 insertions in the prtR gene affecting virulence have recently been identified in a random insertional mutagenesis screen of P. entomophila [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">To test a <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possible</cue> role of prtR in the regulation of aprA expression</scope> , we analyzed the proteins present in the supernatant of prtR mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Interestingly , both prtR mutants ( CL25 and CU1 ) displayed a secreted protein profile identical to the wild-type strain except for a marked decrease of AprA ( Figure 1C , lanes 4 and 5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Measurement of in vitro protease activity with azocasein revealed that the gacA mutant secretes <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> detectable protease activity</scope> and that prtR mutants retain only 30 % of wild-type supernatant activity , thus <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicating</cue> a role for PrtR in the regulation of P. entomophila protease secretion ( Figure 1F )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">Furthermore , the prtR supernatant showed <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">no</cue> toxicity toward flies after injection</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggesting</cue> a correlation between AprA levels and virulence ( unpublished data )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Altogether , this analysis <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">indicates that</cue> P. entomophila gacA and prtR genes regulate the secretion of a protease with toxic activity when injected into flies or fed to larvae</scope> .</sentence>
