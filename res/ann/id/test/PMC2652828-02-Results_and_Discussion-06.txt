SmpB control of biological processes 
SmpB is thought to be limited to trans-translation but has been shown to increase the translation of a single protein - the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS [19]. The normal function of SmpB is in quality control to free ribosomes stalled on defective mRNAs [11], [16]. However, results from our global proteomics analysis indicate that SmpB directly or indirectly modulates the expression of at least 4% of the entire Salmonella Typhimurium proteome determined from ANOVA analysis (p<0.05) (Table S1). The majority of genes encoding these proteins showed no changes in mRNA level thus it is interesting to speculate an additional role for SmpB as a general post-transcriptional/translational regulator in Salmonella Typhimurium. Few of the genes identified are regulated by RpoS again suggesting that this is a direct translational effect and not indirect transcriptional. The RpoS regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium has been initially characterized, identifying 13 conserved RpoS-regulated genes [48]. From our global proteomics analysis we were able to observe gene products for 8 of the 13 conserved RpoS-regulated genes, of which only a single protein, YciF, was regulated by SmpB. We note however that a more detailed and rigorous analysis is required to confirm the speculated global regulatory role of SmpB. Examination of proteins modulated by SmpB revealed a number of SmpB regulated cellular processes. SmpB regulates histidine biosynthesis in AMM-1, affecting HisDGCBHAF. Proteins involved in motility in Salmonella Typhimurium also showed down-regulation during growth in LB media. This set of proteins included the chemotaxis proteins CheZ, CheY, CheW, CheA and Tsr as well as the flagellar proteins FliC, FliD, FliG and FljB. This suggests that a more thorough examination of the role of SmpB in the regulation of cell motility and histidine biosynthesis is warranted. Western blot analysis of FliC relative protein levels validated results from the proteomics analysis (Figure S2B).
