LPS and OPG Mutations Impair Motility by Repressing Flagellar Gene Expression through the Rcs Signaling Pathway 
The widespread influence of LPS and OPG mutations on swimming, swarming, and chi-phage infection prompted us to explore the genetic mechanism of these mutations in more detail. Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system [34,35], and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the flhDC operon [36]. The Rcs pathway consists of a phosphotransfer protein (RcsD) that mediates phosphate transfer from a sensor kinase (RcsC) to a response regulator (RcsB) that binds DNA with an accessory protein (RcsA). Phosphorylated RcsB is known to bind upstream of the flhDC operon and to repress its expression. The pathway also includes a recently identified outer membrane lipoprotein (RcsF) that is known to activate the Rcs system [37]. To determine the role of the Rcs signaling pathway in LPS/OPG mediated repression of motility, we disrupted each of the components of the Rcs system in most of our LPS and OPG mutants. We found that deletion of rcsB, rcsD, or rcsF was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants (Figure S6), providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway. Deletion of rcsC rescued motility to a lesser extent. This observation is consistent with the dual functional role of RcsC as both kinase and phosphatase, moving phosphates both to and away from RcsB via RcsD, and that RcsB remains phosphorylated in rcsC null mutants [38,39]. Therefore, while rcsC mutations disrupt the RcsF-->RcsC-->RcsD-->RcsB phosphorelay cascade, the phosphorylation of RcsB cannot be fully reversed in the absence of RcsC phosphatase activity, as observed by the reduced flhDC-lacZ expression and motility exhibited by rcsC and rcsD mutants (Figure 4). This conclusion is further supported by the dramatic reduction in swimming motility by rcsC137 mutants (Figure S7), in which the rcsC137 gene product has lost its phosphatase activity [40]. The chi-phage selection results suggest that LPS and OPG are necessary for infection. However, since functional flagella are a prerequisite for chi-phage infection, we sought to determine whether defects in LPS and OPG affect chi-phage infection directly or whether the observed selection results are primarily due to reduced flagellar expression. To evaluate the necessity of LPS and OPG for phage infection, we needed mutants that were defective in these structures but still synthesized functional flagella and were motile. Therefore, we created double mutants combining an LPS or OPG mutation and a secondary mutation in one of the components of the Rcs signaling pathway. These mutants were used in an infectivity assay in which plaque-forming units (PFUs) are monitored over time to assess sensitivity to phage infection [25]. An flhD mutant was used as a chi-phage-resistant control and, as expected, showed no sensitivity, whereas chi-phage multiplied rapidly in the presence of the wild-type strain (Figure 5A). Both OPG and LPS mutants showed decreased sensitivity to chi-phage, and the decrease in sensitivity was eliminated by introducing DeltarcsF deletions, indicating that OPG and LPS are not directly required for chi-phage infection (Figures 5B-D). We also observed that sensitivity to chi-phage was higher in rfaI mutants than rfaC mutants, indicating that chi-phage infectivity is directly related to the degree of flhDC expression (Figures 4, 5B, and 5C). In a previous study, the swarming deficiency of LPS mutants had suggested an essential role for LPS in swarming behavior [41]. To test whether such a direct role exists, we interrogated our collection of LPS and OPG mutants for swarming proficiency. We found that mutants with OPG defects and severe LPS truncations were incapable of swarming and that introducing DeltarcsF deletions into these mutants was sufficient to rescue the phenotype (Figures 3F and S6). These data indicate that LPS and OPG are not directly necessary for swarming, and that the behavior exhibited by such mutants results from Rcs-mediated repression of the flhDC operon. A model summarizing the involvement of Rcs signaling on swimming, swarming, and chi-phage infection is shown in Figure 3G.
