Identification of a functional DNA palindrome conserved in S. Typhimurium SPI-2 and the Sodalis glossinidius SSR-3 region 
The analysis of regulatory evolution is particularly challenging because it is difficult to distinguish neutral stochastic change from functional divergence. To solve this problem in the context of mapping the SsrB binding element, we used comparative genomics to search for conserved promoter architecture in another organism with a similar genomic island to Salmonella SPI-2. The tsetse fly endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius contains the Sodalis Symbiosis Region-3 (SSR-3) that is similar in content and synteny with the S. enterica SPI-2 locus [31]. Gene conservation includes the entire T3SS structural module extending to the regulatory genes ssrA-ssrB and all other genes except the effectors sseF and sseG, which are not present in Sodalis SSR-3. We aligned the sequences of the five mapped promoters in SPI-2 with the orthologous SSR-3 regions to identify local conservation. Highly conserved sites within the promoters were restricted to regions previously footprinted by SsrB [25],[26], whereas adjacent sequence showed substantial drift (Figure 4C). Within the conserved sites we identified a heptameric sequence in 7-4-7 tail-to-tail architecture that created an 18-bp degenerate palindrome. This palindrome was found in all SPI-2 and SSR-3 T3SS promoters with the exception of the sseA promoter that had only one reasonably well-conserved heptamer in the footprinted region (Figure 4C and Figure S1). Interestingly, two copies of the palindrome occur upstream of the ssrA-ssrB operon in S. Typhimurium within the same footprint, and the conservation of either site in Sodalis was weak. Evaluation of the heptamer motif in the palindrome showed high similarity to the motifs identified by the bacterial one-hybrid screen and the ChIP-on-chip experiments (Figure 4B and 4D), giving us confidence that we had identified the major recognition module for transcriptional input by SsrB. In accord with a previous observation [26], there was not a strict requirement in the spacing between the SsrB binding site and the downstream transcriptional start site.
