CRISPR loci 
The CRISPR (comprised of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci encoded by some bacterial strains is a recently described system that protects cells from infection with bacteriophage [25-27]. The specificity of the phage resistance conferred by the CRISPR elements and CRISPR-associated genes (cas genes) is determined by spacer-phage sequence similarity. OG1RF carries two CRISPR elements: CRISPR1 (between the OG1RF homologue of EF0672 and EF0673) and CRISPR2 (between the OG1RF homologue of EF2062 and EF2063); CRISPR1 is linked to cas-like genes while CRISPR2 is not (Figure 3). Both OG1RF CRISPR elements are composed of 7 repeats of a 37 bp palindromic sequence with a 29 bp spacer. None of the 29 bp spacers (14 total) have homology to any sequences in GenBank. The CRISPR1-associated proteins belong to the Nmeni subtype [28]. Species bearing this CRISPR/cas subtype have so far been found exclusively in bacteria that are vertebrate pathogens or commensals. The Nmeni subtype is characterized by the presence of four specific cas genes and a single copy of the repeat that is upstream of the first gene in the locus. The four cas genes encode Cas_csn1 (possible endonuclease), Cas1 (novel nuclease), Cas2 (conserved hypothetical protein), and Cas_csn2 (conserved hypothetical protein). The repeat upstream of cas_csn1 appears to have degenerated since it shares only 23 bp with the 37 bp repeat cluster downstream of the last gene. A unique feature of the OG1RF CRISPR1 locus is the presence of a gene downstream of the element, which encodes a hypothetical 119 amino acid transmembrane protein. The presence of the CRISPR loci among E. faecalis strains may be a powerful tool to avoid the load of prophage replication. To determine the distribution of the CRISPR1 locus in E. faecalis strains, 16 isolates of various MLST types were tested for the presence (PCR with primers specific for csn1 and cas1) or absence (PCR with primers overlapping the junction between EF0672 and EF0673) of the CRISPR1 locus (Table 2). Seven strains were cas positive, but negative for the junction and the remaining nine were positive only for the junction. This indicates that the location of the CRISPR1 locus appears to be conserved (between EF0672 and EF0673 when compared with the V583 genome). Interestingly, the two vancomycin resistant strains tested were both cas negative. It is appealing to postulate that the presence of the CRISPR locus in OG1RF may be the reason for the absence of prophage in this strain.
