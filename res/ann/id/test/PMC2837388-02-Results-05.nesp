<sentence id="0">Identification of a functional DNA palindrome conserved in S. Typhimurium SPI-2 and the Sodalis glossinidius SSR-3 region</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The analysis of regulatory evolution is particularly challenging because it is difficult to distinguish neutral stochastic change from functional divergence .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To solve this problem in the context of mapping the SsrB binding element , we used comparative genomics to search for conserved promoter architecture in another organism with a similar genomic island to Salmonella SPI-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The tsetse fly endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius contains the Sodalis Symbiosis Region-3 ( SSR-3 ) that is similar in content and synteny with the S. enterica SPI-2 locus [ 31 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Gene conservation includes the entire T3SS structural module extending to the regulatory genes ssrA-ssrB and all other genes except the effectors sseF and sseG , which are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> present in Sodalis SSR-3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We aligned the sequences of the five mapped promoters in SPI-2 with the orthologous SSR-3 regions to identify local conservation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Highly conserved sites within the promoters were restricted to regions previously footprinted by SsrB [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , whereas adjacent sequence showed substantial drift ( Figure 4C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Within the conserved sites we identified a heptameric sequence in 7-4-7 tail-to-tail architecture that created an 18-bp degenerate palindrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This palindrome was found in all SPI-2 and SSR-3 T3SS promoters <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">with the</cue> exception of the sseA promoter</scope> that had only one reasonably well-conserved heptamer in the footprinted region ( Figure 4C and Figure S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Interestingly , two copies of the palindrome occur upstream of the ssrA-ssrB operon in S. Typhimurium within the same footprint , and the conservation of either site in Sodalis was weak .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Evaluation of the heptamer motif in the palindrome showed high similarity to the motifs identified by the bacterial one-hybrid screen and the ChIP-on-chip experiments ( Figure 4B and 4D ) , giving us confidence that we had identified the major recognition module for transcriptional input by SsrB .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In accord with a previous observation [ 26 ] , there was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> a strict requirement in the spacing between the SsrB binding site and the downstream transcriptional start site</scope> .</sentence>
