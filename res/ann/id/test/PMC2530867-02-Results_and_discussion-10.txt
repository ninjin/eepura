Fusidic acid and rifampicin resistance 
OG1RF was sequentially selected from OG1 for resistance to fusidic acid and rifampicin [9]. The mutation leading to rifampicin resistance was identified in the rpoB gene by Ozawa et al. [54] and is caused by the A1467G mutation, which results in substitution of arginine for histidine at amino acid 489. The mutation also affected the clumping phenotype of traA mutants and this effect appears to be specific for the pAM373 system [54]. All of the other 22 differences in rpoB between OG1RF and V583 are synonymous. Fusidic acid resistance is associated with mutation(s) in the fusA gene, which encodes elongation factor G. We compared fusA from OG1RF with that in V583 and identified two differences (C1368A and T1992C). The mutation T1992C is synonymous, while the mutation C1368A leads to the presence of glutamine (histidine in V583) at position 404 in OG1RF. Mutations in this region have been associated with fusidic acid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [55,56], and thus the C1368A mutation is likely the cause of the fusidic acid resistance phenotype in OG1RF.
