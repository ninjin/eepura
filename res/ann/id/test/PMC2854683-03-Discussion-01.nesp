<sentence id="1">Group A streptococcal sociomicrobiology It is now well established that bacterial populations often consist of heterogeneous communities <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> genetically identical cells</scope> with synchronized gene expression profiles [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we show how gross changes in the bacterial environment , such as the onset of infection , can profoundly perturb the sociomicrobiological structure of the bacterial population , driving a minor subpopulation with a mutant hypervirulent phenotype to thrive , prevail , and cause severe disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although a number of informative studies have compared gene and protein expression in virulent and hypervirulent GAS isolates [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">none</cue> have captured the transitional state that reflects the dynamics of the bacterial struggle to survive in a new host environment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Normally , capturing such evolutionary events in real time is difficult , both because multiple sampling of the bacteria in vivo is often unfeasible due to their dissemination , and because the fittest members of the community usually overtake the rest of the population rather rapidly , thereby hampering the ability to capture dynamic changes associated with the restructuring of the bacterial community at different host niches .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our subcutaneous chamber model of infection allowed us to sample the inoculated WT and AP bacteria at specific times post-infection , during their adaptation to their new environment , to determine how their interaction with the host affects their community structure and their transcriptional reprogramming .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In doing so , we were able to dissect changes in gene expression associated with niche adaptation from those resulting from restructuring of the bacterial community , where undetected minority members in vitro became the new majority in vivo , armed with the necessary tools to survive in their new niche .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These in vivo-selected bacteria with the AP phenotype could be differentiated from the WT bacteria by mutations that are clustered in the sensor kinase-encoding covS gene in AP bacteria [ 14 ] , [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In this study , we captured dynamic events underlying the phenotypic switch resulting from this population restructuring .</sentence>
