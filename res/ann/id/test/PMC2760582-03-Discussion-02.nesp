<sentence id="1">Facing stimuli , different regulatory genes were upregulated in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi , reflecting their unique ability to respond to environmental challenges .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">phoP and cpxR genes identified from P. temperata , encode response regulators in two-component regulatory systems PhoPQ and CpxRA , respectively [ 23,24 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">PhoP and CpxR are dual transcriptional regulators that are activated in response to environmental stimuli and then act to modulate activity of other genes [ 23,24 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="5">Auto-regulation of phoP <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> regulates expression of other genes that mediate various cellular functions such as LPS modification , cell structure [ 26 ] , and type III secretion systems [ 27 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">phoP has been previously identified to be involved in virulence as mutational inactivation of this gene rendered P. luminescens avirulent to Spodoptera littoralis larvae [ 6 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similarly , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the regulatory protein CpxR <cue type="spec" id="1">can</cue> be activated in response to signals associated with growth and metabolic pathways [ 28 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">By sensing cell envelope stress CpxR <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to control expression of other genes involved in envelope stress response , secretion , motility and multidrug resistance [ 29 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Sometimes , CpxR acts to modulate other transcriptional factors [ 30 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Although there is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> evidence showing links between phoP/cpxR and other isolated genes</scope> , overexpression of these two response regulator genes <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possibly</cue> relate to genes involved in stress responses ( gshB , gor , msrA and surA ) , cell structure ( skp , dacC and ompF ) and type III secretion systems ( sctL ) identified in this study</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Further , in P. temperata , lysR gene encoding a transcriptional activator protein was found to be upregulated during infection of R. majalis , while two genes yijC and rseA encoding transcriptional repressors were identified in X. koppenhoeferi .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The pathway network analysis <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicates that</cue> the product of yijC <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> function as a repressor to <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">potentially</cue> control the expression of the fabB gene , which in turn , modulates the physical properties of the membrane by altering the level of unsaturated fatty acid production</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Besides transcriptional regulatory genes , gene tilS , encoding a putative cell cycle protein [ 4 ] , was induced in X. koppenhoeferi .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Upregulation of distinct regulatory genes in these two bacteria <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">indicates</cue> the different stress response mechanisms between the bacterial species in the same host</scope> .</sentence>
