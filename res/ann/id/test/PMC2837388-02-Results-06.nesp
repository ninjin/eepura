<sentence id="0">SsrB directs transcriptional input using a flexible palindrome architecture</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The presence of a conserved palindrome sequence in SPI-2 promoters and in related sequences from the endosymbiont S. glossinidius <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that regulatory input by SsrB was through a palindrome sequence architecture</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , other lines of evidence <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that the recognition site architecture was flexible in nature : ( i ) our bacterial one-hybrid screen isolated functional single hexamer sequences , ( ii ) the SsrB footprint at the naturally evolved sseA promoter within SPI-2 [ 26 ] contained only one reasonably well-conserved heptamer , and ( iii ) degenerate or non-ideal palindromes exist in the genome</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to deconstruct this architecture , we designed a set of experiments to test the palindrome 's tolerance to mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We chose the ssaG promoter for these experiments because 16 of 18 bases were identical between SPI-2 and SSR-3 from S. glossinidius , differing only in the 4-bp spacer between heptamers ( Figure 4C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We mutated the palindrome in a series of transcriptional reporters that were otherwise identical to the evolved ssaG promoter ( Figure 5A ) and promoter activity was compared to that of a wild-type palindrome sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Variants in which the first half-site ( 7 ' ) or second half-site ( 7 '' ) was deleted produced similar transcriptional activity to the wild-type palindrome , verifying that a single well-conserved heptamer is sufficient for transcriptional input under these experimental conditions ( Figure 5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Deletion of the 4-bp spacer sequence between the heptamers - the most degenerate element of the palindrome - also generated wild-type promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , the orientation of individual heptamers was essential for transcriptional input since rewiring the palindrome in any head-to-head orientation produced negligible promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , if the two half sites were swapped front-to-back so that they maintained tail-to-tail orientation ( construct labelled " Reverse " in Figure 5 ) , wild-type promoter activity was restored .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Precise deletion of the entire 18-bp palindrome lead to approximately10 % residual activity in wild-type cells , which was reduced to less than 1 % in an ssrB mutant ( Figure 5C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">To determine <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> the remaining 10 % transcriptional activity was a result of an SsrB-dependent feed-forward mechanism or transcriptional read-through of our chromosomally integrated reporter</scope> , we constructed an ectopic deletion reporter .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Assessment of reporter activity for this construct in addition to wild-type constructs in wild-type and ssrB mutant backgrounds showed a similar level of activity to the ssrB mutant ( Figure 5D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The results for the half-site deletion constructs , which retained activity similar to wild type , were unexpected .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Therefore , we compared the sequences generated upon mutation against a consensus palindrome matrix generated from all SPI-2 and other identified <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">putative</cue> elements</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">The 7'-4-X , X-4-7 '' and 7'-X-7 '' mutations introduced a number of base transitions and transversions never occurring in the matrix , however the modified 7 base pair heptamer retained 4-5 naturally-occurring bases along with the unchanged wild-type sequence in the other heptamer ( Figure S2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">The <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possibility</cue> existed that this modified heptamer</scope> , although now weaker in consensus , could still be sufficient for recruitment of a functional form of SsrB when paired with the other wild-type heptamer .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">To test this , we created an additional ectopic transcriptional fusion construct in which the left half ( 7 ' ) of the palindrome was mutated to bases never occurring in the consensus matrix .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">When tested in promoter activity experiments , this reporter was <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">unable</cue> to activate transcription</scope> and was identical to the X-X-X mutant construct ( Figure 5D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Salmonella SsrB and the Sodalis ortholog ( SG1279 ) are 69 % identical and 81 % similar at the amino acid level .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">All of the critical residues in the dimerization helix and HTH motif required for specific transcriptional activity by SsrB [ 32 ] are conserved in the Sodalis ortholog ( Figure S3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">To demonstrate a functional role for the palindrome identified in Sodalis , we engineered luciferase transcriptional reporters that either contained ( 7'-4-7 '' ) or <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">lacked</cue> ( X-X-X ) the identified palindrome from the Sodalis SG1292 promoter ( ssaG ortholog</scope> ) and transformed them into wild-type S. Typhimurium and an ssrB mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">The transcriptional activity from a wild-type Sodalis palindrome sequence was high , but was completely abolished in an ssrB mutant and in experiments where only the palindrome sequence was precisely deleted ( Figure 5D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">These experiments demonstrated a functional role for the conserved palindrome in Sodalis and the requirement for SsrB for transcriptional activation .</sentence>
