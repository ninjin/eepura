<sentence id="0">Stress response</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hfq was observed to modulate numerous proteins involved in envelope stress under AMM-2 conditions , including FkpA , SurA , HtrA , NlpB , NmpC , ClpA , SlyD , RseA , RseB , RpoE , OmpF , and HtpG , which were all up-regulated in the Deltahfq mutant strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These observations are in agreement with the recently <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> role of Hfq in envelope stress based on lacZ translational fusions [ 34 ] as well as the observation that rpoE is translationally regulated by Hfq [ 10 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Proteins involved in oxidative stress ( NarY , Qor , Dps , WraB , OxyR , GrxA , Gor , GrxB , KatG , KatE , SodC , SodB , AhpF ) ; acid stress ( CadA ) ; and starvation ( SspA , SspB ) were all also differentially regulated by Hfq ( Table S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Collectively , these results point to a central role for Hfq in regulating stress response in Salmonella Typhimurium .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Many of these genes are required for virulence as discussed in more detail below .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">For example rpoE has been shown to be required for the virulence of Salmonella Typhimurium [ 35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Two RpoE-regulated genes , htrA and surA , have also been shown to be involved in Salmonella virulence [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The OxyR-regulated gene dps was demonstrated to contribute to Salmonella oxidative stress resistance , survival in macrophages , and virulence in mice [ 38 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Recent studies have shown the periplasmic Cu , Zn-superoxide dismutase sodC to contribute to Salmonella virulence in mice [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .</sentence>
