<sentence id="0">Conclusions</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To the best of our knowledge , this study represents the first and only genome-wide in vivo gene expression experiment to be conducted with A. pleuropneumoniae in its natural host , the pig , following a natural infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Of the 150 genes that we could identify as differentially expressed , 72 showed greater levels of expression in vivo at the end of the acute phase of the disease than in a rich culture medium , while 78 were repressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By comparing our results to those obtained following comparative genomics and proteomics experiments , we were able to identify three genes that were conserved in tested reference strains and in fresh field isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> these were also <cue type="spec" id="0">predicted</cue> to code for outer membrane proteins or lipoproteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These three genes , namely fhaB ( APL_0959 ) , irp ( APL_0919 ) and APL_0920 , could all represent excellent candidates for the development of a protective cross-serotype subunit vaccine against A. pleuropneumoniae .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While our results can help decipher some of the adaptations A. pleuropneumoniae has to make once it infects the host , much more research is necessary in order to understand the whole picture of the disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The acute stage and the chronic stage of the disease are <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">probably</cue> highly different conditions , and it <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">would</cue> be interesting in future works to compare our present data with the transcriptomic profile of A. pleuropneumoniae during a chronic infection</scope></scope> .</sentence>
