<sentence id="0">Summary</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Post-transcriptional regulation has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been directly examined on a global scale by proteomic methods</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This work has focused on two translational regulators in Salmonella ( Hfq and SmpB ) that are required for virulence .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to accurately characterize global control of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level it is essential to measure global changes in both transcript and protein levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We performed a sample-matched global proteomics and transcriptional analysis to examine the broad impacts of deletion mutants of hfq and smpB on global protein and transcript abundance levels to begin to understand how Hfq and SmpB mediate the control of global gene expression at the post-transcriptional level .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using a sample-matched procedure our strategy simultaneously measures changes in global transcript and protein abundance levels allowing for a clear distinction between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of Hfq or SmpB .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , our strategy requires <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> tagging and or isolation of Hfq or SmpB precluding the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibility</cue> of spurious results introduced by tagging and or co- immunoprecipitation processes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Previous attempts to identify processes/targets regulated by Hfq , and thus targets of sRNA regulation , have relied on transcript-centric approaches .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In one study microarray analysis was used to identify changes in gene expression resulting from <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lack</cue> of Hfq</scope> , thus providing potential new target genes for sRNA regulation [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">High-density oligonucleotide microarrays were used to detect sRNA and other targets of Hfq co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq-specific antibodies [ 26 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Most recently high-throughput pyrosequencing ( HTPS ) was used to detect message and sRNA bound to Hfq following immunoprecipitation [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The result of this work was very surprising namely that Hfq bound to 20 % of all Salmonella mRNA transcripts and at least 64 small RNA molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">One <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> criticism of this work</scope> is that <scope type="spec" id="5"> the RNA co-immunoprecipitated with Hfq <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be brought down simply because Hfq strongly binds to RNA molecules</scope> and that the binding is somewhat non-specific .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Our efforts presented here support the conclusions of that study and <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that an even larger number of Salmonella proteins are translationally regulated than the 20 % <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggested</cue> by these authors</scope> , when accessed across a larger number of growth conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">We have compared wildtype and isogenic hfq and smpB derivatives with matched samples to examine both transcription and translation by global proteomics .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">There were some cases in which a change in protein level could be related to a change in transcription but this was the exception .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">These results <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggest</cue> that while feedback mechanisms between protein abundance and transcript levels exist , the majority of the effects observed here for both hfq and smpB are a result of direct modulation of post-transcriptional events</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">These results have been validated by Western blotting to a number of proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">The amount of translational regulation varied with growth conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">During growth in rich media approximately 14 % of all proteins observed showed differences in abundance where as in acidic minimal media the result was approximately21 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Taking into account all growth conditions about approximately50 % of all observed proteins are regulated by Hfq an astonishingly high number .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">These results <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> explain the very high LD50 of the hfq mutant strain ( > 109 i.p. ) and its growth defect even in rich media</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">It has recently been shown that half of all the known sRNAs in Salmonella associate with Hfq [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">It is interesting to note that in adaptive evolution experiments using a chemostat to continuously alter grow conditions often results in changes in Hfq ( Bernard Palsson , UCSD , personal communication ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">It has long been known that many proteins are transcriptionally regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">These results and the results recently described by Sittka et al. [ 10 ] demonstrate that post-transcriptional/translational regulation plays as large a role in controlling the myriad of bacterial processes as does transcriptional regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">It is the precisely this ability to rapidly adjust to changing conditions in less time than it takes to make an RNA molecule that makes this a pivotal regulatory process .</sentence>
