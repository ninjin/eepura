Conclusion 
This research indicates that selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) is a powerful technique to study in vivo gene expression in bacterial pathogens of insects. Results reveal that phylogenetically related bacteria with similar biology differ dramatically in molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity in the same host. Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria appear to share more genes in host-induced stress protection category, including tolerance against universal stresses, glutathione-mediated protection against oxidative stress, and protection against nucleic acid damage, compared to genes in all other categories. While genes encoding TcaC toxin and hemolysin related proteins were identified to be induced in both P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, the two bacteria seem to use different regulatory genes, secretion systems and virulence factors to achieve infection of the same insect host R. majalis. Further, P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi displayed different metabolic adaptations in the same insect host as reflected by the high proportion of identified genes involved in metabolism. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis and provides molecular targets for genetic manipulation of these economically important nematode symbiotic insect pathogens.
