AprA Confers Protection against the Imd-Dependent Immune Response 
Virulence factors allow pathogens to survive in the hostile environment of the host, to escape the immune system, or to establish a biotope where they can proliferate by altering host functions. The observation that P. entomophila persistence in flies and larvae is lower in aprA mutants clearly indicates that the AprA protease promotes bacterial persistence in the Drosophila gut. Our previous study had already revealed that the humoral arm of the Drosophila immune response mediated by the Imd pathway contributes to resistance against orally transmitted P. entomophila, since flies mutated in the Relish (Rel) gene showed a consistently increased mortality rate [9]. To determine whether AprA plays a role in counteracting the Imd-dependent immune response, we compared persistence of wild-type P. entomophila, gacA, and aprA derivatives by quantifying the number of bacteria in Rel flies and larvae. Whereas the titer of gacA mutants decreased with time, we observed that the aprA derivative persisted at a level similar to wild-type bacteria in Rel-deficient mutant flies and larvae (Figure 3A and 3B, and unpublished data). The observation that AprA was required to promote persistence in wild-type flies and larvae but was dispensable in a Rel background, indicates that AprA plays an important role in the protection against the Imd-dependent immune response. To investigate the connection between activation of the Imd pathway and the outcome of P. entomophila infection in more detail, we focused our analysis on the adult stage when it is easier to monitor survival. P. entomophila infection triggers Imd pathway activation within hours. To determine at which time Imd was required to impede P. entomophila infection, we monitored survival to P. entomophila in flies in which the Imd pathway was artificially activated in a time-dependent manner. We utilized an engineered fly line (UAS-imd, hs-Gal4) over-expressing imd under the control of a heat-shock promoter via the UAS-Gal4 system, which consequently leads to strong expression of Imd-dependent AMP genes. Figure 4A shows that over-expressing imd 12 h prior to infection protected flies from a P. entomophila infection, whereas over-expressing imd 6 h before contributed only modestly to survival of the flies. This experiment indicates that P. entomophila can be eliminated when the Imd pathway is activated at a high level prior to infection. It further suggests that P. entomophila is sensitive to immune defenses during a short time frame and subsequently becomes insensitive. Since P. entomophila is pathogenic under normal wild-type conditions, it may overcome the immune response by establishing a niche in the gut before the Imd pathway is activated. It is interesting to note that in agreement with the results described above, persistence of both the aprA mutant and wild-type bacteria was significantly altered in fly lines over-expressing the Imd pathway, and that aprA mutants survived less than wild-type bacteria (Figure 4B). Altogether, these data reveal that the Imd pathway is crucial for host survival after oral infection with P. entomophila and that AprA plays a key role in counteracting this effect.
