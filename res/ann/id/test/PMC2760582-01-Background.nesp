<sentence id="1">Entomopathogenic Gram-negative enterobacteria Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus form symbioses with the entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis and Steinernema , respectively [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These bacteria <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> only have similar biology but are also phylogenetically related based on 16s rDNA sequence identities [ 2 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">They naturally colonize intestines of the nematode infective juveniles which invade susceptible insects to release the bacteria into the hemolymph .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The bacteria multiply in the hemolymph , killing the insect host within 24-48 h and converting the cadaver into a food source suitable for nematode growth and reproduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">After 1-3 rounds of nematode reproduction , the bacteria recolonize the emerging infective juveniles ensuring their transmission to a new host [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Available evidence <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus encode specific factors to engage in a pathogenic relationship with the insect host [ 3 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The published genome sequence of Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 strain <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates that</cue> virulence genes are encoded within a number of pathogenicity islands located on the bacterial chromosome [ 4,5 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Besides producing toxins to cause insect death , Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus have to first evade the insect 's immune response to establish a successful infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The two bacteria differ in mechanisms by which they evade host immune responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">For example , in Photorhabdus , mutational inactivation of phoP gene results in increased sensitivity to insect immune response and decreased virulence towards insects [ 6,7 ] , while in X. nematophila , phoPQ mutants are more susceptible to immune response but are fully virulent [ 3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">P. luminescens produces a signaling molecule AI-2 to resist reactive oxygen species [ 8 ] and phenylpropanoid chemical ST to inhibit the activity of antimicrobial enzyme PO and formation of melanotic nodules [ 9 ] , <scope type="spec" id="3"> but the strategy used by X. nematophila <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to be that of suppression of transcripts involved in the insect immune response [ 10-12 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In addition , P. luminescens encodes a type III secretion system and one of the effectors , LopT , suppresses phagocytosis and reduces nodulation by haemocytes [ 13,14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">However , the genomes of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. nematophila do <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> show homologues of LopT or a dedicated type III secretion system [ 3 ] , and Xenorhabdus <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">likely</cue> uses flagellar regulatory cascade to control cellular immunity [ 15 ]</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Despite the identification of the above regulatory and virulence factors from Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus , the full profiles of genes expressed during insect infection by these two closely related bacteria are unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Munch et al. [ 16 ] identified 29 promoters induced by P. luminescens in the presence of isolated Galleria mellonella homogenate using a differential fluorescence induction approach .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">However , treatment with insect homogenate <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">might</cue> neglect physicochemical parameters as inducers which <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">could</cue> result in different sets of genes being upregulated during natural infection of live insects</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">We used selective capture of transcribed sequences ( SCOTS ) technique to study in vivo gene expression in Photorhabdus temperata ( associated with the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora GPS11 ) and Xenorhabdus koppenhoeferi ( associated with the nematode Steinernema scarabaei AMK001 ) during infection of the same insect host Rhizotrogus majalis .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">They were selected according to their distinct pathogenicity in insects of the family of Scarabaeidae - S. scarabaei is more virulent to R. majalis than H. bacteriophora .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">However , unlike their nematode partners , both bacterial species are highly virulent to Rhizotrogus majalis .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">In addition , although X. koppenhoeferi grows slower than P. temperata both in vitro and in vivo , the LD50 and LT50 value do <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> differ between these two bacteria [ 17 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">We <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">hypothesize</cue> that the two bacteria species will use both common and distinct molecular mechanisms during infection of the same insect host</scope> .</sentence>
