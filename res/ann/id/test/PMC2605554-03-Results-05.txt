SpeB is the principal target of RopB regulation in vivo 
Microarray analysis was performed on in vivo-derived RNA from the well characterized GAS strain 5448 and its derivative 5448R-, containing the mutated ropB allele from 5628. Fourty-seven genes were found to be down-regulated and 52 genes were found to be up-regulated in 5448R- greater than 2-fold (P<0.05). The most strongly down-regulated genes in 5448R- are members of the SpeB operon, as would be expected from the lack of SpeB expression and activity in 5628 (Fig. 3). In addition to the SpeB operon, genes of the streptolysin S operon were also found to be strongly down-regulated in the ropB mutant strain. Apart from the gene encoding the superantigen SmeZ, there was an absence of virulence-related genes found to be strongly up-regulated in the strain 5448R-, which expressed the truncated RopB.
