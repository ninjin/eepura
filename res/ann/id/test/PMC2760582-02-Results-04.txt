Analysis of biological associations of in vivo-induced genes 
To understand the function and interactions of the identified gene products, interactive networks were built to provide an overview of how gene products relate to each other by leveraging databases of published literature. Using PathwayStudio (Ariadne, Rockville, MD, USA) program, we were able to distill all published information about biological relationships of bacterial homologs of the identified genes. Molecular interactions linking each identified gene product in terms of binding, direct molecular regulation, effects on expression, transportation, and molecule synthesis were elucidated in PathwayStudio. Based on this analysis, the biological significance of each gene was inferred. Linkage between proteins shows how upregulated genes may influence other genes or gene products. For example, gene rpoB, induced in both bacteria, interacts with many gene products, suggesting its overall importance during insect infection (see Additional files 1 and 2). Other identified genes with multiple connections to different gene products were different between P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi, indicating distinct biological processes used by the two bacteria for insect infection. Moreover, linkages with small molecules indicate how normal functions in gene regulation networks are influenced by small molecules that may be available in the insect body. For example, regulation of genes yncB and purH in P. temperata are influenced by aromatic compounds and formate, respectively (see Additional file 1). In X. koppenhoeferi, gene trxB is influenced by arabinose and selenium, and gene znuA is influenced by etoposide (see Additional file 2). Compared to the biological interactions (see Additional files 1 and 2), molecular pathways or networks in which identified genes link to each other were further illustrated (see Additional file 3). In total, 20 genes from P. temperata and 18 from X. koppenhoeferi (see Additional file 3) were found to be part of the dense protein interaction networks, indicating that these genes may act in concert to achieve successful infection. Some products encoded by induced genes were found to interact with as many as eight other gene products in the network. For example, P. temperata pckA and X. koppenhoeferi aceE both influence 8 other genes in the network (see Additional file 3). As a whole, the protein networks of the identified genes were different for the two bacteria except that NAD synthetase gene nadE was found to be common to both bacteria.
