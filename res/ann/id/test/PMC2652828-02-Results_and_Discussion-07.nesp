<sentence id="0">Proteins co-regulated by Hfq and SmpB</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We were interested in determining <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> there was overlap in translational regulation between Hfq and SmpB i.e.</scope> , the extent of cross-talk or level of co-ordination if any between these two translational regulators ( Table S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">For example it was <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> that Hfq directly modulates translation of smpB and therefore all of the effects observed for smpB could be related to Hfq. For logarithmic phase growth conditions</scope> , the expression pattern of 242 proteins <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appeared</cue> to exhibit a dependence on Hfq</scope> , while 37 proteins exhibited a dependency on SmpB .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Twenty proteins overlapped both sets , including the motility proteins FliC , CheA , CheZ and Tsr. Under stationary phase growth conditions 270 proteins <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">appeared</cue> to be under control of Hfq and 27 proteins under control of SmpB</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Nine proteins , including the NADPH-dependent quinine oxidoreductase Qor , TolC involved in LPS biosynthesis , and a <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">putative</cue> hydrolase YbeM</scope> , overlapped .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Of the 390 proteins regulated by Hfq and 50 proteins regulated by SmpB in growth in AMM-2 , 15 proteins were co-regulated by both Hfq and SmpB , including the invasion protein PrgI , MdoH involved in the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharide , and a <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">putative</cue> periplasmic protein CreA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Under growth in AMM-1 267 proteins appeared regulated by Hfq and the expression pattern of 86 proteins exhibited a dependence on SmpB .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Twenty four of these proteins were co-regulated by both Hfq and SmpB .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This subset included a putative serine/threonine protein kinase , a <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">putative</cue> intracellular proteinase YhbO</scope> , SrfJ , a known Salmonella Typhimurium virulence protein , and the stress protein HtpG .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results also confirm that there is no direct translational control of smpB by Hfq.</sentence>
