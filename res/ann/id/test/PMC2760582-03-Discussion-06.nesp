<sentence id="0">Genes involved in nutrient scavenging</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Induction of different types of nutrient uptake systems in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus further emphasized the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> differences in nutritional requirements of the two bacteria in the insect host</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Ion scavenging systems induced in P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi are completely different .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In P. temperata , pchC , a gene involved in the biogenesis of pyochelin type of siderophore [ 61 ] , was upregulated indicating the importance of iron , whereas a siderophore-independent zinc ion transport system encoded by gene znuA [ 62 ] was induced in X. koppenhoeferi indicating the importance of zinc .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Also supported by the pathway analysis , product of glnD identified from P. temperata <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> controls the production of siderophore ( see Additional file 1 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition to ion scavenging systems , artM , encoding a <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">putative</cue> ABC amino acid transport system [ 63</scope> ] was identified in P. temperata , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in X. koppenhoeferi</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Besides transporting L-arginine across the inner membrane [ 63 ] , the pathway network reveals that the product of artM participates in cystine transport ( see Additional file 1 ) , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that this gene <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> also mediate cystine amino acid acquisition</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Upregulation of artM in P. temperata also <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggests</cue> that amino acids <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be available for uptake in the insect</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Similarly , it has been discussed previously that histidine and phosphatidylethanolamine , the <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">possible</cue> components presented in the insect host hemolymph</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> be important food sources used by P. luminescens for growth within the insect host [ 64</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">As cysteine synthesis gene cysK was also identified from P. temperata as discussed above , it <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">indicate that</cue> the level of cysteine either synthesized by P. temperata or acquired from the insect host is <scope type="neg" id="10"><cue type="neg" id="10">not</cue> sufficient during infection</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Interestingly , <scope type="spec" id="13"> X. koppenhoeferi <cue type="spec" id="13">seems</cue> to require sugar as malF gene which is involved in uptake for maltose and lactose was upregulated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Further , P. temperata but not X. koppenhoeferi induced tolB gene that encodes a Tol protein upon insect infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">As a periplasmic protein , TolB is an extra member in the Tol system .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In E. coli , Tol system stabilizes the outer membrane structure and mutations in Tol encoding genes result in hypersensitivity to deleterious agents [ 65 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Despite <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">unknown</cue> mechanistic details of Tol system</scope> , upregulation of P. temperata tolB gene <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">suggests</cue> that it <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">may</cue> be involved in importing biomolecules by somehow supplying energy or transport as noted by Nikaido [ 66 ] in other bacteria</scope></scope> .</sentence>
