Genome-Wide Identification of Genetic Interactions 
The identification of novel genes that influence the expression of a phenotype is only the first step towards understanding its genetic basis. Gene products function within the context of highly interconnected structural and regulatory networks. We can dissect the genetic network context in which newly identified genes function by making libraries of double mutants in which a transposon library is constructed in the background of a mutation of interest. The phenotypic characterization of this library by a screen or selection can identify genetic interactions between the query mutation and all possible insertional mutations in the genome, thereby revealing the local genetic context in which the query locus functions to influence the phenotype. Systematic analyses of such interactions in yeast [46,47] are providing a wealth of knowledge about gene function and pathway organization. An important class of such interactions is suppressor mutations that either partially or fully restore the phenotype deficits of a query mutation. In a genome-wide effort to identify suppressors of swimming defects, additional libraries of transposon insertional mutants were created in genetic backgrounds containing gene deletions of interest. Secondary insertional mutations were observed to suppress motility defects in Deltahns and DeltayhjH genetic backgrounds (Figures 6C and S8A). These suppressor mutations were identified by inoculating soft-agar plates with approximately108 double mutants and extracting cells from the motile front after approximately20 h of incubation at 30 degreesC. A sample of suppressor mutants extracted from the extreme edge of the motile front was used for both microarray-based genetic footprinting, and for isolation of individual mutants for subsequent characterization. Transposon insertion sites were identified in individual clones by applying the genetic footprinting procedure outlined in Figure S1. Among the 18 suppressor mutants sampled at random from the DeltayhjH background, half had insertions in different regions of ycgR, a gene encoding a protein of unknown function (Figure 6D). This finding is consistent with a recent report in which the inactivation of ycgR was observed to improve motility of yhjH mutants [48]. The other half of DeltayhjH suppressor mutations were found to contain insertions within the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed genes yfgF and yfgG, which encode gene products of unknown function. P1 transduction of this insertion to the DeltayhjH isogenic background confirmed the ability of the insertion to suppress the motility defect (unpublished data). However, deletions of either yfgF or yfgG produced no measurable difference in motility in the DeltayhjH background (Figure S9). Conversely, overexpression of yfgF (but not yfgG) was found to suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants (Figure 6E). Microarray-based genetic footprinting of the entire pool of mutants extracted from the motile front guided the identification of five additional suppressor mutations (Figure 6F; Dataset S11). Among the loci that partially suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH are fliZ (a gene predicted to be a regulator of the flagellum-specific sigma factor sigma28), yfiR (a gene identified in the selection for swarming motility defective mutants), and three additional genes of unknown function: yjdA, yjcZ, and yegE. We hypothesize that mutations partially suppressing the chemotaxis defect of DeltayhjH mutants do so by correcting the severe CCW flagellar rotation bias. When combined in the same background, these mutations may bring the motor bias closer to the optimal operating point for chemotaxis, either by having an opposing effect on the intracellular concentration of signaling molecules known to affect motility (discussed in the next section) or by an unknown mechanism that overrides the CCW bias. Further studies are underway to explore the functional relationship between yhjH and these suppressor mutations. The mechanisms by which deletion of yegE and overexpression of yfgF suppress the motility defect of DeltayhjH mutants are discussed in the next section. Suppressor mutations identified in the Deltahns background are shown and discussed in Figure S8, and the microarray results can be found in Dataset S12.
