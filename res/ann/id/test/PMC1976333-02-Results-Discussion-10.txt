The Role of the C-di-GMP Second-Messenger System in Swimming and Swarming Motility 
Based on sequence homology, YhjH, YfgF, and YegE belong to the newly identified and highly prevalent family of proteins that function in the turnover of bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which is a second messenger involved in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial behaviors [49]. Synthesis of c-di-GMP is catalyzed by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and its degradation is regulated by phosphodiesterases (PDE). The cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities have been attributed to GGDEF and EAL protein domains, respectively [50,51], and the activity of these domains is known to have opposite effects on motility [52]. YhjH contains an EAL domain, and expression of this protein leads to the degradation of c-di-GMP and enhanced motility in S. enterica [52]. Based on this observation and because EAL domain proteins function in the degradation of c-di-GMP, we hypothesized that the motility defect of DeltayhjH (Figure 1C) is a result of increased intracellular levels of c-di-GMP. YegE and YfgF both contain an EAL domain C-terminal to a GGDEF domain (Figure 6G). The presence of domains of opposing activities in a single protein complicates functional inferences. However, a single GGDEF/EAL composite protein exhibiting concomitant DGC and PDE activities has not been reported. In addition, several GGDEF/EAL composite proteins were found to exhibit either DGC or PDE activity [53,54]. Based on the known antagonistic effects of c-di-GMP on motility [52] and by following several lines of reasoning, we hypothesized the dominant enzymatic activities of the GGDEF and EAL domains in YfgF and YegE. We argue that YfgF has an active EAL domain and functions as a PDE based on three observations: (1) expression of this gene enhances motility of the DeltayhjH strain (Figure 6E); (2) the amino acid sequence of YfgF shows similarity to enzymatically active EAL domains (Figure S10); and (3) the amino acid sequence lacks a complete GGDEF motif needed for DGC activity (data not shown). Likewise, three observations suggest that the EAL domain in YegE is inactive and that this protein functions primarily as a DGC: (1) deletion of YegE enhances motility of the DeltayhjH strain (Figure 6F); (2) the amino acid sequence of the EAL domain in YegE is not consistent with an enzymatically active form (Figure S10); and (3) YegE contains an intact GGDEF motif (data not shown). Based on these observations, we propose that deleting yegE and over-expressing yfgF suppress the motility defect of the DeltayhjH strain by reducing the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP (Figure 7). Deletion of yegE and over-expression of yfgF did not have significant effects on the motility of the wild-type strain (unpublished data). E. coli has 19 genes encoding proteins with GGDEF domains [55]. If c-di-GMP levels act globally and can influence motility, then insertions in many of the genes containing active GGDEF domains should rescue motility in the DeltayhjH double mutant library. However, the results of the genome-wide screen for suppressors of the DeltayhjH motility defect reveals that this is not the case (Table S2). These observations suggest that the expression and/or enzymatic activities of these GGDEF-containing proteins may be under precise context-dependent control. Alternatively, specificity in c-di-GMP signaling may be due to a number of mechanisms including spatial and temporal sequestration, microcompartmentalization, restricted production/degradation, or target modification [56]. The manner in which c-di-GMP alters motility at the molecular level is currently unknown. However, it has been reported that c-di-GMP binds to the PilZ domain of the aforementioned YcgR protein [48]. It is hypothesized that YcgR undergoes a conformational change upon binding to c-di-GMP, and that the YcgR-c-di-GMP complex impairs motility through a protein-protein interaction with the flagellar motor [57]. Such an interaction may explain the observed rotational bias of flagella in DeltayhjH mutants (Figure 6B) and is in agreement with our finding that mutations in ycgR strongly suppress the motility defects of DeltayhjH mutants (Figure 6F). In addition to its effects on swimming, we found evidence that c-di-GMP signaling also plays a role in swarming motility. As stated previously, mutations in yfiR strongly abolish swarming motility. The yfiR gene is the first in an operon that also contains yfiN and yfiB (inset of Figure 7). The arrangement of these genes in an operon suggests that they may function together. YfiR is predicted to be a periplasmic protein, YfiB shows sequence similarity to outer-membrane porin proteins, and YfiN is a predicted inner-membrane protein with GGDEF and HAMP domains. We found that deletion of yfiN strongly suppresses the swarming defect of the DeltayfiR strain, indicating that yfiR is genetically upstream of yfiN, and that YfiR may regulate the DGC activity of YfiN's GGDEF output domain by interacting with the HAMP sensory input domain (Figure 7). Mutations in ycgR were also found to suppress the swarming defect of the DeltayfiR strain (unpublished data), suggesting that YcgR binds c-di-GMP to affect both swimming and swarming motility. The observations that the DeltayhjH mutant is impaired in swimming but indistinguishable from the wild-type strain in swarming, while in contrast the DeltayfiR strain cannot swarm and is only mildly impaired in swimming, support the notion that c-di-GMP signaling pathways are temporally and/or spatially separated, as recently suggested by others [58,59].
