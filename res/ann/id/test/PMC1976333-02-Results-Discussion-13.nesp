<sentence id="0">Conclusions and Summary</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Microbes account for half the world 's biomass and are the most widely distributed organisms on the planet .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Yet most of our genetic understanding of bacterial behavior comes from the tiny fraction of microbes studied in the laboratory .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">With the recent advances in bacterial whole-genome sequencing [ 68,69 ] , the scientific community is poised to take systems-level experimental approaches to rapidly reveal novel and fundamental insights into the microbial world .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we have established a powerful framework for the efficient and comprehensive identification of the genetic basis of complex bacterial behaviors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The power of this approach lies in the rapid and parallel manner in which positive and negative genetic contributions can be mapped to any phenotype after competitive selection .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We demonstrated this approach in four distinct but complementary selections to reveal the genetic basis of E. coli motility .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Using this framework , we identified greater than 95 % of previously known flagellar and chemotaxis genes , and we found three dozen novel contributors to motility consisting of both characterized and uncharacterized genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although similar approaches have been successfully applied to the study of pathogenicity [ 70-74 ] , the large number of genes reported and the limited analyses of individual mutants made it difficult to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the methods employed in these studies <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> detect the subtle quantitative differences necessary to map genetic loci with high sensitivity and specificity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In this study , we confirmed our findings by functional analyses of individual mutants , which revealed high levels of sensitivity and low rates of false positives .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In addition , we have shown that the same method can be used to quickly and thoroughly explore the genetic interactions between a single locus and all other genetic loci in the genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These interactions correspond to important network-level concepts ; for example , the flow of information within signal transduction pathways and second-messenger systems such as c-di-GMP .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In addition to identifying gene-by-gene interactions , we have shown that the same framework can be used to reveal gene-by-environment interactions that are crucial for understanding function within the rich ecological context in which genetic networks have evolved .</sentence>
