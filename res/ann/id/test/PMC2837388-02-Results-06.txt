SsrB directs transcriptional input using a flexible palindrome architecture 
The presence of a conserved palindrome sequence in SPI-2 promoters and in related sequences from the endosymbiont S. glossinidius suggested that regulatory input by SsrB was through a palindrome sequence architecture. However, other lines of evidence suggested that the recognition site architecture was flexible in nature: (i) our bacterial one-hybrid screen isolated functional single hexamer sequences, (ii) the SsrB footprint at the naturally evolved sseA promoter within SPI-2 [26] contained only one reasonably well-conserved heptamer, and (iii) degenerate or non-ideal palindromes exist in the genome. In order to deconstruct this architecture, we designed a set of experiments to test the palindrome's tolerance to mutation. We chose the ssaG promoter for these experiments because 16 of 18 bases were identical between SPI-2 and SSR-3 from S. glossinidius, differing only in the 4-bp spacer between heptamers (Figure 4C). We mutated the palindrome in a series of transcriptional reporters that were otherwise identical to the evolved ssaG promoter (Figure 5A) and promoter activity was compared to that of a wild-type palindrome sequence. Variants in which the first half-site (7') or second half-site (7'') was deleted produced similar transcriptional activity to the wild-type palindrome, verifying that a single well-conserved heptamer is sufficient for transcriptional input under these experimental conditions (Figure 5B). Deletion of the 4-bp spacer sequence between the heptamers - the most degenerate element of the palindrome - also generated wild-type promoter activity. However, the orientation of individual heptamers was essential for transcriptional input since rewiring the palindrome in any head-to-head orientation produced negligible promoter activity. However, if the two half sites were swapped front-to-back so that they maintained tail-to-tail orientation (construct labelled "Reverse" in Figure 5), wild-type promoter activity was restored. Precise deletion of the entire 18-bp palindrome lead to approximately10% residual activity in wild-type cells, which was reduced to less than 1% in an ssrB mutant (Figure 5C). To determine whether the remaining 10% transcriptional activity was a result of an SsrB-dependent feed-forward mechanism or transcriptional read-through of our chromosomally integrated reporter, we constructed an ectopic deletion reporter. Assessment of reporter activity for this construct in addition to wild-type constructs in wild-type and ssrB mutant backgrounds showed a similar level of activity to the ssrB mutant (Figure 5D). The results for the half-site deletion constructs, which retained activity similar to wild type, were unexpected. Therefore, we compared the sequences generated upon mutation against a consensus palindrome matrix generated from all SPI-2 and other identified putative elements. The 7'-4-X, X-4-7'' and 7'-X-7'' mutations introduced a number of base transitions and transversions never occurring in the matrix, however the modified 7 base pair heptamer retained 4-5 naturally-occurring bases along with the unchanged wild-type sequence in the other heptamer (Figure S2). The possibility existed that this modified heptamer, although now weaker in consensus, could still be sufficient for recruitment of a functional form of SsrB when paired with the other wild-type heptamer. To test this, we created an additional ectopic transcriptional fusion construct in which the left half (7') of the palindrome was mutated to bases never occurring in the consensus matrix. When tested in promoter activity experiments, this reporter was unable to activate transcription and was identical to the X-X-X mutant construct (Figure 5D). Salmonella SsrB and the Sodalis ortholog (SG1279) are 69% identical and 81% similar at the amino acid level. All of the critical residues in the dimerization helix and HTH motif required for specific transcriptional activity by SsrB [32] are conserved in the Sodalis ortholog (Figure S3). To demonstrate a functional role for the palindrome identified in Sodalis, we engineered luciferase transcriptional reporters that either contained (7'-4-7'') or lacked (X-X-X) the identified palindrome from the Sodalis SG1292 promoter (ssaG ortholog) and transformed them into wild-type S. Typhimurium and an ssrB mutant. The transcriptional activity from a wild-type Sodalis palindrome sequence was high, but was completely abolished in an ssrB mutant and in experiments where only the palindrome sequence was precisely deleted (Figure 5D). These experiments demonstrated a functional role for the conserved palindrome in Sodalis and the requirement for SsrB for transcriptional activation.
