<sentence id="0">b) Comparison with other in vivo studies</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Among previous in vivo experiments that were conducted with A. pleuropneumoniae , the one that was closest to ours in terms of experimental conditions and results was by Baltes et al [ 18 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In their experiment , Selective Capture of Transcribed Sequences ( SCOTS ) was performed on lung tissues after a 7 day infection with A. pleuropneumoniae ( end of acute phase ) , and 46 genes were identified [ 18 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Of the 150 differentially expressed genes that we have identified ( see Additional file 1 ) , 15 were also identified in other in vivo studies conducted with A. pleuropneumoniae ( Table 2 ) : only 4 of these were up-regulated following transcript profiling in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These include 3 genes already identified by Baltes et al. using SCOTS at the end of the acute stage of the disease [ 18 ] : fucI , encoding the L-fucose isomerase , nrdD , encoding an anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase , and apxIVA , encoding the ApxIVA toxin structural protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The latter , the gene encoding the recently discovered fourth A. pleuropneumoniae Apx toxin [ 31 ] , had only been detected in vivo [ 32-34 ] until it was discovered recently that it is also up-regulated after contact with broncho-alveolar lavage fluids [ 30 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It is also the only apx gene that was up-regulated in our experiment , but it is worth noting that the apxIBCD and apxIIAB genes , although not differentially expressed , were all actively transcribed in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , the last gene that was up-regulated in our study and identified in another in vivo study is nanE , which codes for a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase</scope> , an enzyme involved in the use of N-acetylneuraminate and N-acetylmannosamine as carbon sources [ 35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The differences between our results and those obtained in other in vivo studies can be easily explained : while the second SCOTS experiment was conducted with animals suffering from chronic infections [ 10 ] , a condition which differs greatly from our field case , the STM and IVET techniques do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> provide a " snap-shot " of the transcriptome at a precise time point during the infection process</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">While STM and IVET can theoretically provide a global overview of transcriptomic events , the experiments conducted with A. pleuropneumoniae are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> to have</scope> achieved this goal</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Only 800 mutants were screened by Fuller et al. with IVET [ 12 ] , well short of the approximately 2000 genes of the A. pleuropneumoniae genome , and although Sheehan et al. screened 2064 mutants using STM [ 16 ] , the authors noted that both their STM screen and the previous STM experiment by Fuller et al. [ 15 ] were <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">likely</cue> <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> saturating</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">STM relies on transposon mutagenesis , and there are some insertional hot spots in the A. pleuropneumoniae genome [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We also compared our results to the transcriptional profile of a virulent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , another lung pathogen , isolated from a chronically infected cystic fibrosis patient [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">There were <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> striking similarities</scope> when comparing the functions of differentially expressed genes in both studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Since P. aeruginosa is well-known for the versatility of nutrients it <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">can</cue> use for growth</scope> , and since both conditions ( chronic infection vs acute infection ) were highly different , this was to be expected .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">However , one interesting aspect of both cases was the list of genes <scope type="neg" id="8">that were <cue type="neg" id="8">n't</cue> up-regulated as predicted</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">As with Son et al. , we noticed that few of the landmark virulence genes in A. pleuropneumoniae were up-regulated in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Out of the three Apx toxins present in serotype 5b , only the gene encoding the ApxIV toxin was up-regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">The Hsf autotransporter homolog , <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">thought</cue> to be important in adhesion processes , as well as pga genes necessary for biofilm formation</scope> , were <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> identified either</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Well-characterized iron acquisition genes such as those coding for the hemoglobin receptor HgbA ( despite the important hemorrhage noticed in the infected lungs ) and the genes coding for transferrin binding proteins TbpA and TbpB did <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">no</cue> show differential expression</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="12"><cue type="neg" id="12">nor</cue> did genes involved in anaerobic respiration</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">While in the latter case it can be argued that the environmental conditions encountered during the acute infection <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">might</cue> explain why <scope type="neg" id="13">differential expression of these gene transcripts was <cue type="neg" id="13">not</cue> observed</scope></scope> , it could also be <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">hypothesized</cue> that years of evolution of the field strain in nature <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">might</cue> have led to the loss of some regulatory mechanisms that <scope type="spec" id="17"> <cue type="spec" id="17">could</cue> still be present in well-characterized laboratory strains</scope> , thereby leading to the constitutive expression of some important virulence genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21"><scope type="spec" id="18"> <cue type="spec" id="18">In</cue> the case of the P. aeruginosa clinical isolate</scope> , it was shown that more than 300 genes had higher levels of constitutive expression in the clinical isolate than in a well-characterised reference strain , therefore showing the deregulation of several pathways [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">Whether this is also the case for A. pleuropneumoniae will have to be assessed .</sentence>
