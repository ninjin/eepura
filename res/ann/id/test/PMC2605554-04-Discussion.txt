Discussion 
The cumulative contribution of the secreted cysteine protease SpeB to the pathogenesis of invasive GAS infection is at present unclear, and studies in various GAS serotypes and animal models have produced varying results [19]-[21]. In the globally-disseminated clonal M1T1 serotype associated with epidemic invasive GAS infection, an inverse relationship has been found between SpeB activity and clinical disease severity [8]. Recently, we and others have found a connection between inactivation of SpeB through mutation in the two-component regulatory system covR/S and development of invasive disease in the murine model [37], [38]. In this study, we have investigated a second mechanism of inactivation of SpeB, namely through truncation of the regulator RopB. We have shown that in M1T1 GAS, when the covR/S locus is intact and DNase Sda1 activity is unaffected, ropB point mutation results in reduced virulence in vivo, despite inactivation of SpeB activity. The SpeB-negative, serotype M1T1 clinical isolate 5628 was used to investigate the role of RopB in virulence. RopB has previously been shown to be necessary for SpeB production [23], [24] as well as regulation of other GAS virulence factors [25]-[29]. The M1T1 strain 5628 contains a point mutation in the ropB gene that results in a truncation of the last 110 amino acids of the 280 amino acid protein. Restoration of full-length RopB in 5628R+ resulted in gaining SpeB expression, but did not result in changes in hemolysis, DNase activity or resistance to killing by neutrophils. RopB mutation in this particular strain does not result in the kind of global phenotypic change found with covR/S mutation where differential expression was observed of multiple genes encoding virulence determinants, including sic, ska, slo, speA, speJ, scpC and the hyaluronic acid synthesis operon [37] which were all unaffected in the ropB mutant examined in this work. Recently, we have demonstrated that WT, SpeB-positive bacteria undergo a phase-shift to a SpeB-negative phenotype after subcutaneous infection of mice [17]. This phase switch was observed to be the result of mutations in the two-component regulatory system covR/S [38]. CovR/S is a global regulator, whose inactivation is linked to an invasive phenotype and involves up-regulation of many genes encoding virulence factors such as streptodornase, streptokinase, streptolysin O, streptococcal inhibitor of complement and the hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis operon [37]. Of the down-regulated genes in CovR/S mutant strains, SpeB would appear to be one of the most important due to its ability to degrade many host and self-proteins. It is the loss of SpeB expression in these mutant bacteria that is hypothesized to allow the invasive spread of GAS by sparing from SpeB degradation self-proteins involved in plasminogen accumulation and activation [42]. In this study we found that SpeB-positive bacteria with a restored RopB reverted to a SpeB-negative phenotype on subcutaneous infection. Furthermore, the switch to a SpeB-negative phenotype appeared to occur exclusively through mutations in covR/S. This result suggests that covR/S mutations are the predominant method of phenotypic switching in GAS and that ropB mutation is not readily selected for in vivo. This leads to the conclusion that ropB mutation in 5628 does not represent a similar mechanism to covR/S mutation and may (a) be an incidental occurrence or (b) arise secondary to different selection pressures than those associated with the shift to invasive infection. Microarray analysis was conducted using in vivo-derived RNA, since the transcriptome of bacteria grown in vitro may differ greatly from the transcriptome found during the course of infection. Implantation of tissue cages allows for bacteria to be grown in an in vivo environment for 24 hours prior to recovery and RNA extraction. The microarray data showed members of the SpeB operon to be the most strongly down-regulated genes following inactivation of RopB. This finding supported the in vitro and in vivo data that suggested SpeB is the main target of RopB regulation in this strain. Virulence studies utilizing systemic models of infection showed that a full-length RopB was required for virulence. The clinical isolate 5628 expressing a truncated RopB, as well as the allelic exchange mutant 5448R- also expressing the truncated RopB from 5628, showed reduced virulence compared to strains containing a full-length RopB. These data illustrate the necessity for an intact RopB for full virulence in vivo. In addition, the strain 5628RDeltaSpeB expressing an intact RopB but lacking SpeB showed similarly reduced virulence to the strain with a truncated RopB. While the down-regulation of the streptolysin S operon may contribute to the reduced virulence, this finding implies that the loss of SpeB in this strain is the main cause of the lack of virulence exhibited. This finding leads to the conclusion that inactivation of SpeB alone is not sufficient to initiate invasive disease. Moreover, these data suggest that SpeB loss, only in the context of mutation of the covR/S regulatory circuit, promotes invasion. Of note, the additional virulence factors streptokinase and M1 protein, are both up-regulated in covR/S mutant M1T1 strains [37], but not in the ropB mutant under investigation in this study. Streptokinase and M1 protein are believed to play a role in the accumulation of host plasmin at the GAS cell surface, a process which is thought to accentuate invasive disease [5], [42], [43]. Together these data provide evidence of RopB's role in virulence. In M1T1 GAS, an intact RopB and efficient SpeB production are necessary for systemic infection.
