T1000	Negation 892 895	not
E1000	Negation:T1000 Scope:T1001
T1001	Span 892 935	not apparent in the DeltasmpB mutant strain
T1002	Speculation 475 478	may
E1001	Speculation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 475 524	may be the preferred intracellular metabolite [47
T1004	Speculation 1316 1319	may
E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1316 1345	may be essential for activity
T1006	Speculation 1209 1217	suggests
E1003	Speculation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 1209 1345	suggests the pdu operon to be a potential target of sRNA regulation and that correct coordinate expression may be essential for activity
T1008	Speculation 1660 1666	likely
E1004	Speculation:T1008 Scope:T1009
T1009	Span 1660 1853	likely plays a substantial role in the regulation of the protein expression of the cob-pdu operon, required for intra-macrophage replication [47], via post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms
T1010	Speculation 1647 1655	suggests
E1005	Speculation:T1010 Scope:T1011
T1011	Span 1647 1757	suggests Hfq likely plays a substantial role in the regulation of the protein expression of the cob-pdu operon
