<sentence id="0">Conclusion</sentence>
<sentence id="1">This research <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> selective capture of transcribed sequences ( SCOTS ) is a powerful technique to study in vivo gene expression in bacterial pathogens of insects</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Results reveal that phylogenetically related bacteria with similar biology differ dramatically in molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity in the same host .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to share more genes in host-induced stress protection category , including tolerance against universal stresses , glutathione-mediated protection against oxidative stress , and protection against nucleic acid damage , compared to genes in all other categories</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">While genes encoding TcaC toxin and hemolysin related proteins were identified to be induced in both P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi , <scope type="spec" id="2"> the two bacteria <cue type="spec" id="2">seem</cue> to use different regulatory genes , secretion systems and virulence factors to achieve infection of the same insect host R. majalis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , P. temperata and X. koppenhoeferi displayed different metabolic adaptations in the same insect host as reflected by the high proportion of identified genes involved in metabolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Overall , this study provides a better understanding of the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis and provides molecular targets for genetic manipulation of these economically important nematode symbiotic insect pathogens .</sentence>
