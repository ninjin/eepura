<sentence id="0">SpeB-positive bacteria revert to a SpeB-negative phenotype on subcutaneous infection</sentence>
<sentence id="1">C57BL6/J mice were subcutaneously infected with the SpeB-positive strain 5628R+ .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Three days post-infection , bacteria were recovered from the lesion and screened for SpeB status using the skim-milk agar method .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While the inoculum was 100 % SpeB-positive , bacterial populations recovered from the lesions of individual mice were found to be 2 % , 4 % , 6 % , 8 % , and 24 % SpeB-negative .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Five representative colonies were picked , and the covR/S locus was sequenced in each of them .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">All colonies sequenced were found to have substitution mutations in covR/S resulting in truncation of CovS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This finding reveals that when SpeB-negative colonies are selected for in vivo , this selection is predominantly a phenomenon associated with CovR/S inactivation .</sentence>
