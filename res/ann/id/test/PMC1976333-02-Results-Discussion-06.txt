Novel Genes Implicated in Swimming, Swarming, and chi-Phage Infection 
Application of microarray-based genetic footprinting to swimming, swarming, and chi-phage selection was effective in identifying nearly all known flagellar and chemotaxis genes. Remarkably, the selection results guided the identification of three dozen additional genes that affect motility, most of which have no previous evidence of involvement in motility (Table S1). Most of these non-flagellar genes encode components of the cell envelope. For example, of the 20 non-flagellar genes revealed to affect swimming motility, twelve encode constituents of the inner membrane and periplasmic space. These gene products include transport proteins (SdaC, TatA, TatB, TatC, and WzxE), enzymes (DsbA and Prc), periplasmic glucan synthesis proteins (MdoG and MdoH), members of a signaling pathway (RcsC and RcsD), and a predicted inner membrane protein of unknown function (YrfF). Of these, only the genes encoding RcsD and glucan synthesis proteins had been previously implicated in swimming motility [32,33]. In addition, we identified several genes that encode cytoplasmic components and other genes of unknown function, including fimE, hycG, intG, rep, ulaE, and yhjH. We systematically tested all newly identified swimming mutants for surface motility, and found that deletions of dsbA, intG, prc, rcsC, rep, tatB, tatC, wzxE, and yrfF strongly impair swarming. Surprisingly, while mutants with deletions of rcsD, sdaC, tatA, and yhjH were impaired in swimming, these mutants swarmed normally (unpublished data). Interrogation of genes with high z-scores in the enrichment for mutants incapable of swarming identified two additional genes that impact surface motility: hns, encoding a global transcriptional regulator, and yfiR, encoding a predicted periplasmic protein of unknown function. In-frame deletions of these genes abolished swarming; however, while the Deltahns mutant showed a severe swimming defect, the swimming motility of the DeltayfiR mutant was only mildly impaired (Figures 3D and 4). Among the loci exhibiting high z-scores after chi-phage selection were the rfa and mdo gene clusters responsible for the structural assembly of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPG). Genes involved with the synthesis of LPS and OPG precursors (hldD, hldE, galU, gmhA, gmhB, and pgm) were also highly abundant after chi-phage selection. These findings suggested that mutations in LPS and OPG biosynthetic genes may compromise motility. We confirmed this expectation by creating in-frame deletions of nearly all genes involved in LPS and OPG biosynthesis and assaying the mutants for motility. OPG mutants were defective in both swimming and swarming; surprisingly, however, only mutants with large LPS truncations showed significant defects in these behaviors (Figures 3E and 4). The wide functional repertoire of gene products found to affect motility prompted us to examine whether genetic perturbations in these loci affect motility by signaling upstream of the regulatory circuit that controls flagellar biogenesis, resulting in repression of the flhDC flagellar master operon. To investigate this possibility, we introduced flhDC-lacZ translational fusions in the deletion strains and performed beta-galactosidase assays. Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mutants tested showed significant reduction in flhDC-lacZ expression values relative to the wild-type strain, demonstrating that the motility defects can be partly attributed to reduced expression of the flhDC operon. In addition, we noticed that LPS mutants varied widely in flhDC expression and that the repression of this operon, and the corresponding motility defect, were related to the degree of LPS truncation (Figure 4).
