Discussion 
Transcriptional regulation of the genes is important process for successful adaptation of pathogenic bacteria to changing environments, particularly, during the interaction of pathogen with human host. In S. agalactiae, a total of 21 TCSs are involved in the regulatory network essential for successful colonization, penetration and/or invasion as well as for resistance to human immune system. In this study, we investigated the functional role of Sak188/Sak189 two-component system in regulation of the expression of beta-antigen, an important virulence factor of S. agalactiae. It was demonstrated that both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta-antigen were controlled by the Sak189 response regulator, but not Sak188 histidine kinase. It was also found that regulation occurred at transcriptional level. Finally, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene, but not sak188 gene, significantly affects virulent properties of S. agalactiae. Variety of publications are currently available regarding the occurrence of bac gene among S. agalactiae strains as well as genetic polymorphism of bac gene and use of encoded beta-antigen as a vaccine component [32], [34]-[38]. In some strains, the mutations in bac gene resulted in expression of truncated non-functional forms of beta-antigen [39], [40]. However, the regulatory mechanism of bac gene expression has not been studied. In present study, the sak188 and sak189 genes of S. agalactiae were inactivated. Given that insertional inactivation does not delete the entire gene from the chromosome and often results in truncated or modified protein, we analyzed which functional activities of Sak188 and Sak189 proteins could potentially retain if the modified proteins expressed. Comparative analysis of Sak188 and Sak189 amino acid sequences in the wild-type strain 168/00 and deduced protein sequences in mutant strains predicted the replacement of 95 amino acids at the C-terminal end of Sak188 protein by 191 amino acids, and replacement of 51 amino acids at the C-terminal end of Sak189 protein by 15 amino acids (Fig. 5). Importantly, 8 out of 9 amino acids, which composed HTH motif presumably involved in DNA-binding according to BLASTp analysis (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), were lost in Sak189 protein due to insertional mutagenesis. Similarly, ATP-binding and Mg2+-binding sites located at C-terminal end of Sak188, which are essential for phosphorylation, were lost in Sak188 protein due to the mutagenesis. Theoretically, in both sak188 mutant strain and sak189/sak188 double mutant strain, the Sak188/Sak189 TCS can be inactive. In S. pneumoniae, inactivation of the response regulator RR06 (83% similarity with Sak189), which binds promoter region of cbpA, repressed transcription of the cbpA gene [22]. In this study, western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that DNA-binding response regulator Sak189 is necessary for beta-antigen expression suggesting direct binding of Sak189 with bac gene promoter. This is not surprising given the high similarity in the sequences, functions and relative locations of Sak188/Sak189 and HK06/RR06, and beta-antigen and CbpA (Fig. 1). Importantly, insertional inactivation can have a polar effect on the genes located downstream. In this study, both sak188 and bac genes located downstream the sak189 gene (Fig. 1). As seen from the Fig. 3, insertional inactivation of sak189 affected bac gene transcription, while insertional inactivation of the sak188 did not affect. Thus, we can conclude that sak188 and bac gene are not in the operon, and repression of bac gene transcription in sak189/sak188 double mutant strain is not due to the polar effect. Given that insertional inactivation of sak188 gene does not affect beta-antigen expression, we suggest that beta-antigen expression can be activated independently of Sak188, perhaps through small-molecular-weight phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate or other noncognate histidine kinases. Thus, we can not rule out the possibility of a cross-talk between Sak189 response regulator and sensor kinase(s) in S. agalactiae, and Sak189 can potentially recruit another histidine kinase for proper functioning. The cross-talk among different TCSs has been described for many bacterial species [3] including pathogenic streptococci. For example, in S. pneumoniae inactivation of histidine kinase HK06 (78% similarity with Sak188), in contrast to RR06 (83% similarity with Sak189), did not repress transcription of the adjacent cbpA gene [22] indicating a cross-talk between RR06 and noncognate histidine kinase(s). Intraperitoneal infection of laboratory mice demonstrated that Sak189 DNA-binding response regulatory protein is important for virulent properties of S. agalactiae. It could be predicted given that inactivation of other S. agalactiae TCSs (CovS/CovR, DltR/DltS, RgfA/RgfC) resulted in the changes of virulent properties, however, in all these studies the mutant strains became less virulent compared to the wild-type strains [8]-[12]. In the present study, insertional inactivation of sak189 gene abrogated beta-antigen expression but resulted in increased virulence (Fig. 4). Thus, we suggest that beta-antigen located on the bacterial surface can interfere with the disease process and play a role of anti-virulent factor (at least, in mice) similarly to hyaluronate lyase of S. pyogenes [41]. It is also in agreement with results of Kong et al. who demonstrated that presence of shorter variants of beta-antigen is associated with increased virulence [32]. It is also possible that bac gene encoding for beta-antigen is not only target for Sak188/Sak189 TCS. The difference among the growth curves of the wild-type and mutant strains (data not shown) indicate that in addition to bac gene, some metabolic genes can be controlled by Sak188/Sak189 TCS. This suggestion is confirmed by the numerous studies demonstrating the genome-wide location of the genes affected by TCSs [10], [42], [43], and set of the genes controlled by Sak188/Sak189 (TCS regulon) can be identified using microarray technology. As seen from the data of this study, transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta-antigen are the primary genotypic/phenotypic properties controlled by Sak188/Sak189 TCS. Therefore, it is reasonable to annotate this system as BgrR/S (bac gene regulatory system), and DNA-binding response regulator Sak189 and sensor histidine kinase Sak188 as BgrR and BgrS proteins, respectively. In conclusion, the data presented here characterize the functional role of S. agalactiae Sak188/Sak189 two-component system. Both transcription of bac gene and expression of encoded beta-antigen are controlled by Sak189 response regulator, and the regulation occurs at transcriptional level. Inactivation of histidine kinase Sak188 does not affect transcription of bac gene and expression of beta-antigen, that suggests the cross-talk between Sak189 and other sensor kinase(s) in S. agalactiae. Finally, Sak189, but not Sak188, controls virulent properties of S. agalactiae in vivo.
