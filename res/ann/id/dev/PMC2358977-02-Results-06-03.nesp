<sentence id="0">Genes encoding proteins of <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> function</scope></sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several membrane proteins such as 05SSU0677 and 05SSU1912 were also repressed in DeltasalKR .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is well documented that <scope type="spec" id="1"> surface proteins or cell wall-anchored proteins are usually <cue type="spec" id="1">thought</cue> to contribute to the immunogenicity [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , invasiveness [ 35 ]</scope> - [ 37 ] , and even pathogenesis [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] of pathogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , <scope type="spec" id="2"> it <cue type="spec" id="2">should</cue> be noted that numerous proteins of <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">unknown</cue> function</scope> are also depressed in DeltasalKR , which <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> in part</scope> lead to the virulence loss of the mutant via some thus-far-unknown mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Remarkably , <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> gene was found to be up-regulated</scope> ( more than twice ) in DeltasalKR .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To examine the validity of the microarray data , we performed further quantitative real-time PCR analysis on 42 genes using RNA from three independent cultures of each strain ( WT , the DeltasalKR mutant and the complemented strain CDeltasalKR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These genes include the total 26 ones that are down-regulated in the DeltasalKR mutant , four virulence factors ( CPS , MRP , EF , SLY ) coding genes [ 40 ] - [ 44 ] , genes immediately flanking the salKR locus ( 05SSU0945 and 05SSU0942 ) , and 10 genes that selected from the chromosome of 05ZYH33 every 200 ORFs .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As shown in Table S1 , the quantitative results of RT-PCR were highly compatible to the microarray data , in the DeltasalKR mutant , 41 out of 42 selected genes ( 97.6 % ) were confirmed to have similar transcript levels using these two different techniques , thus independently confirming the microarray results .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The discrepancies of target genes expression between microarray data and real-time quantitative PCR results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">probably</cue> best reflects differences in the relative sensitivity and specificity of the two methods</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Among the 26 down-regulated genes in the DeltasalKR mutant , five did <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> recover to expression level of the wild-type strain</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">indicating that</cue> the complemented strain does <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> imitate completely the exact tuning of gene expression as in the wild-type strain</scope></scope> .</sentence>
