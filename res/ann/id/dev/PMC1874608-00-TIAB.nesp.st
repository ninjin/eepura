T1001	Span 646 853	suggests that Mlc exerts positive effects on the expression of SPI1 genes by reducing the expression of HilE, which is known to down-regulate the expression of SPI1 genes through direct interaction with HilD

E1001	Negation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 488 585	the effects of Mlc on hilD expression and bacterial invasiveness were not seen in the hilE mutant

T1007	Span 869 926	the two known promoters of hilE were not modulated by Mlc

E1004	Speculation:T1008 Scope:T1009
T1009	Span 1371 1532	propose that Mlc functions to sense the availability of sugars and is linked to virulence gene regulation by its ability to control hilE expression in Salmonella
