<sentence id="0">The PmrB protein is necessary for the mild acid activation of PmrA</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The PmrB protein is necessary for activation of the PmrA protein in low Mg2+ ( Kox et al. , 2000 ; Kato and Groisman , 2004 ) and in the presence of Fe3+ ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) , consistent with the notion that PmrB is the major phosphodonor for PmrA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> PmrB was also required for the pH-dependent induction of pbgP , which was chosen as a prototypical PmrA-activated gene because the PmrA protein binds to the pbgP promoter in vitro ( Wosten and Groisman , 1999 ) and in vivo ( Shin and Groisman , 2005 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus , we determined the beta-galactosidase activity of isogenic pmrB strains harbouring a chromosomal pbgP-lac transcriptional fusion : expression was approximately sixfold lower in a pmrB mutant than in the pmrB+ strain following growth at pH 5.8 ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">3 ) , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> a functional pmrB gene is necessary for a normal response to mild acid pH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">There was residual pbgP expression in the pmrB mutant induced with mild acid pH ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">3 ) , which was in contrast to the absence of pbgP transcription in the pmrA mutant ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> that PmrA <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">could</cue> become phosphorylated from another phosphodonor(s) when PmrB is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> present</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We considered the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possibility</cue> of PmrA being phosphorylated from acetyl phosphate</scope> because acetyl phosphate has been shown to serve as phosphoryl donor to several response regulators when their cognate sensors are absent ( see Wolfe , 2005 for a review ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Consistent with this notion , pbgP transcription was abrogated in the pmrB mutant upon deletion of the pta and ackA genes ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">3 ) , which encode the two enzymes that are required for the production of acetyl phosphate ( Wolfe , 2005 ) ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In contrast , a strain <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">lacking</cue> the ability to synthesize acetyl phosphate but with a functional pmrB gene</scope> exhibited wild-type pbgP expression levels ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">3 ) , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">implying</cue> that under normal conditions ( i.e. when a functional pmrB gene is present ) acetyl phosphate does not contribute to PmrA phosphorylation</scope> .</sentence>
