<sentence id="0">INTRODUCTION</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that initiates disease , which is normally limited to gastroenteritis in humans .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , this bacterium causes systemic disease in mice and has been used as an animal model of typhoid fever .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Since Salmonella is acquired usually by oral ingestion of contaminated materials , a key step in the infection process is passage across the intestinal epithelium by invasion of M cells in Peyer 's patches ( 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Many of the genes required for intestinal penetration and invasion of host cells are carried on the 40-kb region at centisome 63 , which is called Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) ( 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">SPI1 contains at least 37 genes , which encode various components of the type III secretion systems ( T3SSs ) , its regulators and its secreted effectors ( 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The effector proteins mediate actin cytoskeleton rearrangement , in the form of large membrane ruffles , which engulf the bacteria into the host cell ( 4,5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The expression of SPI1 is controlled in response to a specific combination of environmental signals , including pH , oxygen tension , medium osmolarity , bile , Mg2+ concentration , short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAS ) , and growth stage of the bacteria ( 3,6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although many factors and a complex mechanism related to environmental stimuli are involved in the modulation of SPI1 genes , <scope type="spec" id="0"> they are <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to converge on the activation of several transcriptional regulators encoded within SPI1 , such as HilA , HilC , HilD and InvF ( 7-9 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">HilA plays a crucial role in the expression of genes that encode the SPI1-T3SS apparatus , the prg and inv/spa operons , by binding upstream of prgH and invF ( 10 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The expression of invF leads to the induction of several effector genes encoded both within SPI1 ( sic/sip operon ) and outside SPI1 ( sigD/sopB and sopE ) , with SicA as a co-factor ( 11 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">HilC and HilD , which are members of the AraC/XylS family , have been postulated to act as a derepressor of hilA expression by counteracting the action of negative regulatory elements at the hilA promoter ( 12,13 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">However , it has been shown that HilD provides an essential activating function for hilA in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of negative regulators ( 14 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">HilC and HilD also directly activate the alternative promoter of the invF operon , which is independent of HilA ( 15,16 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Similar to HilC and HilD , RtsA activates the expression of SPI1 genes by binding upstream of the master regulatory gene , hilA , to induce its expression ( 9,17 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Recently , Baxter and Jones ( 18 ) have shown that HilE is an important Salmonella-specific regulator of hilA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">A null mutation in hilE causes an increase in hilA expression and invasion .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Using two-hybrid analysis , it has been shown that HilE interacts with HilD , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that HilE represses hilA expression by inhibiting the activity of HilD through a protein-protein interaction ( 19,20 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Several other genes have been identified that exert positive or negative effects on these direct regulators of SPI1 in response to the changes in environmental conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">These genes include those that encode several two-component regulatory systems ( PhoP/Q , PhoBR , OmpR/EnvZ and SirA/BarA ) , post-transcriptional systems ( CsrAB , RNase E , PNPase and Lon ) , nucleoid proteins ( HU , FIS , H-NS and Hha ) , signaling molecules ( ppGpp and NpnN ) , and other regulatory proteins ( FliZ , FadD and CpxA ) ( 6,7,19,21,22 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">The phosphoenolpyruvate : sugar phosphotransferase system ( PTS ) is the major sugar transport system in many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">In the animal model , attenuation of virulence has been noted for Salmonella strains that carry mutations in the pts , crr , cya or crp genes , which encode the general energy-coupling enzymes of the PTS , enzyme IIAGlc of the PTS , adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP receptor protein , respectively ( 23,24 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">Mlc is a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism and controls several genes involved in sugar utilization ( 25-27 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Therefore , it <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">seemed</cue> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> that Mlc also affects the virulence of Salmonella</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">In the present study , a Salmonella Typhimurium mlc mutant was constructed to investigate the contribution of Mlc to the virulence phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">We have found that Mlc activates SPI1 gene expression by repressing hilE expression .</sentence>
