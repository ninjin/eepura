<sentence id="0">RpoE fine tunes expression of a subset of SsrB-regulated virulence factors in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background The survival of Salmonella enterica within the intracellular host niche requires highly co-ordinated expression of virulence effectors predominantly regulated by the SsrAB two-component regulatory system .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">S. enterica serovar Typhimurium mutants <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> the ssrAB genes</scope> are avirulent in mice , highlighting the importance of this regulatory system in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Mutants <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacking</cue> the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor sigmaE ( rpoE )</scope> are also highly attenuated for intracellular survival , pointing to a potential connection with the SsrAB regulatory system .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Results In this study we demonstrate that RpoE is involved in fine-tuning the expression of a subset of SsrB-regulated genes found in the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 ( SPI-2 ) genetic locus that encodes a horizontally acquired type III secretion system , and unlinked genes integrated into this regulon that are required for virulence in host animals .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Conclusion These data point to a potential connection between the virulence phenotype of strains <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacking</cue> ssrB and rpoE</scope> , and highlight new transcriptional regulation that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> be essential for appropriate temporal and spatial control of the virulence-associated type III secretion system during host infection</scope> .</sentence>
