<sentence id="1">Analysis of the Salmonella mlc mutant revealed that invasiveness for epithelial cells was impaired by the mlc mutation ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is well known that SPI1 is required for the invasion of host cells and induction of macrophage apoptosis ( 2,3,40 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The genetic evidence to date is consistent with a regulatory cascade of transcriptional activation , in which HilD , HilA and InvF act sequentially to activate SPI1 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In brief , HilD binds directly to sites upstream of hilA and invFD and acts as an activator ( 14,16,36 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">HilA activates the transcription of invFA and SPI1-T3SS apparatus genes required for the secretion of effector proteins , whereas the expression of effector proteins is regulated by InvF ( 10,11 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This regulatory cascade <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">implies</cue> that the reduced invasive phenotype of mlc mutant is the result of hilD repression , which affects both hilA and invF expression ( Figures 1 and 2 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The 2-3-fold decrease in hilD expression caused by the mlc mutation is sufficient to account for the nearly 10-fold decrease in hilA and invFA transcription , owing to the nature of the feed-forward regulatory loop , in that moderate effects on HilD production are amplified ( 9 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although the Salmonella mlc mutant was less invasive for epithelial cells than the wild-type strain , the extent of the reduction in invasiveness and cytotoxicity of the mlc mutant was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> as great as we had expected</scope> , considering the observed reduction in SPI1 gene expression ( Figure 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be partly due to the expression of hilC , a de-repressor of hilA , <scope type="neg" id="2">which was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> reduced in the mlc mutant ( Figure 2A )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The hilC mutation had little effect on SPI1 gene expression or the invasive phenotype , whereas the over-expression of hilC suppressed the hilD mutation , thereby promoting high levels of hilA and invF expression , which <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> that HilC can partially compensate for the loss of function of HilD and the invasive phenotype ( 8,9,15 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We have reported previously that there <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be an independent hilC regulatory pathway that is <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> applicable to hilA or invFA regulation when bacteria respond to changes in osmolarity ( 29 )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our data clearly demonstrate that Mlc directly regulates hilE expression by binding to the hilE P3 promoter ( Figure 5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The two Mlc-binding sites in hilE P3 identified by the gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting analysis show high-level homology with the known consensus Mlc-binding sequences ; additionally , the two Mlc-binding sites are separated by 98nt , as is the case for other promoters that have two Mlc-binding sites ( 41 ) .</sentence>

<sentence id="17">The HilC/D-dependent transcriptional start site of the invFD promoter is 631bp upstream of the invF open reading frame ( 16 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">The UTR of the hilA gene is also up to 350nt in length , and is <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggested</cue> to be involved in the complex regulation of hilA in response to environmental signals ( 8,12 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">It has been demonstrated that the region 190-270-bp upstream of the hilE promoter is required for the activation of hilE P2 expression by FimYZ , which is a response regulator that is involved in the expression of type 1 fimbriae and motility genes ( 18 , Figure 5C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Therefore , we cannot rule out the <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">possibility</cue> that additional cis- or trans-acting regulatory elements , which have <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> yet been characterized</scope> , are involved in hilE expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Glucose and mannose induce the Mlc regulon ( 39 ) by dephosphorylating EIICBGlc , which then sequesters Mlc from its binding sites ( 27,43 ) .</sentence>

<sentence id="23">The addition of excess glucose to the culture medium results in the reduction of cell association by S. Typhimurium ( 44 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">The glucose present in DLB ( LB broth diluted 1:5 ) decreased hilA expression 2.5-fold , as compared to DLB <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">without</cue> glucose</scope> , while lactose and arabinose had little effect on hilA expression ( 45 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">The results presented in this study support the <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">notion</cue> that hilE expression is activated as a result of Mlc sequestration by unphosphorylated EIICBGlc in the presence of glucose</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">We observed a 2-fold activation of hilE and concomitant repression of hilD in the presence of glucose or mannose , which are known inducers of the Mlc regulon , when TB was used ( Figure 6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">However , <scope type="neg" id="13">the effect of the sugar was <cue type="neg" id="13">not</cue> seen when LB was used</scope> ( data <scope type="neg" id="14"><cue type="neg" id="14">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">We <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">speculate</cue> that the nutrient-rich LB broth <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">may</cue> mask the effect of the sugar on hilE expression because the effect of sugar addition on hilA expression was more distinct in DLB than LB ( 45 )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">In addition , hilE expression was also increased in the presence of arabinose , which <scope type="spec" id="17"> <cue type="spec" id="17">suggests</cue> an additional regulatory mechanism mediated by arabinose</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="32">These results <scope type="spec" id="19"> <cue type="spec" id="19">suggest</cue> that the presence of complex regulatory mechanisms for hilE is required for optimal regulation of the SPI1 genes</scope> , as can be expected from the complex regulatory networks identified in Salmonella ( 46 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="33">It has been <scope type="spec" id="20"> <cue type="spec" id="20">suggested</cue> that the two-component regulatory system PhoR-PhoB leads to increased hilE P2 expression and subsequent repression of hilA and invasion genes ( 7,18 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="34">The PhoR sensor kinase phosphorylates PhoB when extracellular Pi levels are low , and the phosphorylated PhoB then binds and activates the promoters in the Pho regulon .</sentence>
<sentence id="35">However , even in the <scope type="neg" id="21"><cue type="neg" id="21">absence</cue> of PhoR</scope> , many carbon sources are known to activate the Pho regulon via CreC , which is a PhoR homolog ( 47 ) .</sentence>
