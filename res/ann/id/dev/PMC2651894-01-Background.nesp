<sentence id="0">Background</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Salmonella enterica are enteric pathogens that acquired a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) through horizontal gene transfer of a genomic island termed Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 ( SPI-2 ) [ 1,2 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The SPI-2-encoded T3SS and its translocated effectors modify the intracellular host niche for Salmonella replication [ 3-5 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">SPI-2 also has genes , ssrA and ssrB , which code for SsrAB , a two-component regulatory system needed for expression of the T3SS [ 6,7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">SsrB regulates the expression of SPI-2 encoded substrate effectors including ssaB , as well as several integrated virulence effectors such as sseL [ 8 ] and srfN [ 9 ] that are encoded elsewhere on the chromosome but that have integrated into the SsrB regulon .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutants lacking ssrAB are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to survive within macrophages</scope> and are avirulent in mice [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Alternative sigma factors coordinate gene expression in response to environmental cues sensed by the bacterium .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Sigma factors have a specific recognition motif at the -35 and -10 positions and function to concentrate RNA polymerase at a subset of promoters [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">One alternative sigma factor , RpoE ( sigmaE ) responds to envelope stress at the cell surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Release of sigmaE from its inner membrane anchored anti-sigma factor , RseA , leads to induction of genes required to maintain cell envelope integrity [ 11 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">SsrB-regulated translocated effectors protect S. Typhimurium against host cell defences such as oxidative stress and antimicrobial peptides that perturb bacterial membrane integrity and provide a stimulus for sigmaE release [ 4,12-15 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Although proficient at cellular invasion , rpoE or ssrB mutants are highly attenuated for intracellular survival in both cultured cells and animal hosts [ 16 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In addition , the expression of rpoE and ssrB is up-regulated within macrophages [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Links between RpoE and virulence gene expression is evident in other bacterial systems as well .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Deletion of rseA in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes elevated virulence effector synthesis and secretion [ 18 ] , establishing links between alternative sigma factors and virulence-specific regulators .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Taken together , <scope type="spec" id="2"> a connection between sigmaE and SsrB is <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> from the available literature</scope> , however the role of sigmaE in activating SsrB-regulated genes has <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> been studied</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">We tested the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesis</cue> that RpoE is involved in expression of genes that use the SsrB response regulator for activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">By testing six promoters representing four classes of SsrB-regulated promoters ( ( i ) two type III secretion structural operons in SPI-2 , ( ii ) the effector operon in SPI-2 , ( iii ) two effector genes unlinked with SPI-2 , and ( iv ) an integrated virulence gene unlinked with SPI-2 ) we demonstrate that RpoE elicits an effect on a subset of SsrB-regulated genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">This effect was bidirectional depending on the promoter and was downstream of ssrB expression itself , since deletion of rpoE had <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> effect on SsrB levels in the mutant cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">These data help unite the virulence phenotypes of strains <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">lacking</cue> SsrB and RpoE</scope> , and highlight new transcriptional regulation that <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">might</cue> be essential for appropriate temporal and spatial control of the virulence-associated type III secretion system during host infection</scope> .</sentence>
