<sentence id="0">Role of SalK/SalR in Virulence</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Given the multiple roles of TCSTS in bacteria , we evaluated the effect of salKR deletion on the general biological characteristics of SS2 prior to in vivo work .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">First , the ability of the mutant strain to retain spectinomycin resistance was assessed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The spectinomycin resistance phenotype was stable in DeltasalKR during in vitro culture <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Next , the growth kinetics curves of DeltasalKR were compared with that of WT , and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> obvious distinctions were observed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When streaked on THB plates with 5 % sheep blood , DeltasalKR and WT colonies displayed a similar haemolytic phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Finally , cell morphology and ultrastructure of these two strains were examined under light microscope and transmission electron microscope respectively , however , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> significant differences were found</scope> ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">An experimental infection model in piglets was designed to assess the role of SalK/SalR in virulence .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">As shown in Figure 5 , all six SPF-piglets inoculated intravenously with WT developed most of the typical disease symptoms , including high fever , limping , swollen joints , shivering , CNS failure and respiratory failure within 24 hrs .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Five of them died on day 2 post-infection , and the last one on day 3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In contrast , six infected piglets with an avirulent strain , 05HAS68 ( as negative control ) , survived nearly <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> any obvious symptoms until the end of the experiment ( 14 days after infection )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Wherein the six piglets challenged with the DeltasalKR mutant were all alive and symptom-free during the entire course monitored .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">This was similar to those observed in the negative control group , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> DeltasalKR totally loses its lethality</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The experiments of functional complementation with the complemented strain CDeltasalKR showed clearly that the reintroduction of salKR into DeltasalKR restored its high pathogenicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Five out of six piglets succumbed to the lethal infections of CDeltasalKR and died , with median survival times of 2 to 3 days .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">The last one recovered from serious clinical symptoms and survived at the experiments end .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">All these results strongly <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that SalK/SalR plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Chinese isolates of highly invasive SS2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">To better evaluate the virulence attenuation of DeltasalKR , colonization experiments were carried out .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">As shown in Table 1 , wild-type bacteria were found in all of the SS2 specific tissues of WT-infected piglets , including heart , lung , liver , kidney , spleen , tonsil , brain , blood , joints and so on .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">In contrast , in the mutant-inoculated group , <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> mutant bacteria</scope> could be recovered from any of the examined tissue specimens .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Obviously , lack of SalK/SalR badly impaired the capability of 05ZYH33 to colonize the various tissues of piglets .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">In the WT/DeltasalKR coinfection group , besides the detection of wild-type bacteria in all the specimens , DeltasalKR mutant bacteria could also be isolated from some susceptible tissues ( such as heart , kidney , tonsil and brain ) at a lower degree than the wild-type strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">We anticipated that the DeltasalKR mutant is still able to colonize these organs , is just due to the WT-mediated impairment of host defense against SS2 infection in these tissues .</sentence>
