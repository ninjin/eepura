<sentence id="1">Since the first description of human infection in Denmark in 1968 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> SS2 <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> to have developed some <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue> machinery to behave much more invasively</scope> , which is supported by two recent large-scale outbreaks of human epidemics in China ( one had 25 cases with 14 deaths in Jiangsu in 1998 , the second had 204 cases with 38 deaths in Sichuan in 2005 ) [ 4 ] , [ 5 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">During the past decades , a series of virulence determinants of SS2 involved in the survival , spread and pathopoiesis of the bacterium within the host have been identified , such as capsule polysaccharide ( CPS ) , muramidase-related protein ( MRP ) , suilysin , etc.</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Very recently , Chen et al. [ 6 ] reported a candidate PAI of approximately89 kb in the epidemic outbreak strains of SS2 infections in China , gave some genomic clues for elucidating molecular pathways by which SS2 behaved so aggressively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , they did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> provide sufficient experimental evidence supporting the prediction of 89K PAI which was largely based on the results of bioinformatical analysis</scope> , and the functions of the vast majority of genes encoding within the 89K island remain largely <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="6">Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the GC content of salKR is far less than that of 89K island and the whole genome , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">implying</cue> that this TCSTS is of foreign origin <scope type="spec" id="6"> which <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It has been well documented that horizontal gene transfer events occur frequently in pathogens [ 45 ] - [ 47 ] , and some of them have been implicated in high pathogenicity [ 48 ] and even in the causation of severe diseases [ 49 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="13">These results <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">indicate</cue> definitely that SalK/SalR plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of SS2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The reduction in virulence was mostly restored in a complemented strain upon reintroduction of functional copies of salK and salR into the mutant , <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">suggesting</cue> that it did <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">not</cue> result from polar effects on expression of flanking genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">We consider that the partial complementation observed in the piglets infection model is inherent to the pleiotropic role of this regulatory system which makes it difficult to restore the fine tuning of gene expression as in the wild-type strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Results of real-time quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed that , in the complemented strain CDeltasalKR , only partial genes identified as down-regulated in the mutant rebounded to comparative transcript levels of the wild-type strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Those unrecovered genes were <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">probably</cue> irrelavent to the bacterial virulence of SS2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">It is known that TCSTSs are often implicated in the regulation of the direct downstream genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">However , genes immediately flanking the salKR locus were identified as transcriptionally unaffected by the disruption of the salKR genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">This result is in agreement with the predicted operon organization in the genome , which <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">suggests</cue> that salK and salR are a single co-transcriptional unit</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Among the 26 target genes affected by SalK/SalR , 17 of them ( 65.4 % ) were <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">predicted</cue> to be monocistronically transcribed</scope> , the others to be part of larger transcriptional units ( Table 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">For those members belonging to <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">putative</cue> transcriptional operons</scope> , microarray results showed that most of those genes cotranscribed with them were also down-regulated to a various degree , although under the threshold of 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">In the 89K island , transcripts of only two genes designated 05SSU0935 and 05SSU0953 that encode a hypothetical protein and a DNA recombinase respectively , were decreased in DeltasalKR , their contributions to the attenuation are unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">It <scope type="spec" id="17"> <cue type="spec" id="17">seems</cue> that SalK/SalR <scope type="spec" id="18"> <cue type="spec" id="18">may</cue> control the full virulence of SS2 by regulating distant gene expression at the genome-wide level</scope></scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="30">First , some pathogenic determinants are environmentally regulated and induced at specific stages of the infection process [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .</sentence>
