<sentence id="0">Mlc regulation of Salmonella pathogenicity island I gene expression via hilE repression</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The global regulator Mlc is a repressor of several genes and operons that are involved in sugar uptake and metabolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mlc mutant showed reduced levels of invasion and cytotoxicity compared to the wild-type , and exhibited reduced expression levels of hilD , hilA and invF , which are regulatory genes in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , <scope type="neg" id="0">the effects of Mlc on hilD expression and bacterial invasiveness were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> seen in the hilE mutant</scope> , and hilE expression was increased in the mlc mutant , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that Mlc exerts positive effects on the expression of SPI1 genes by reducing the expression of HilE , which is known to down-regulate the expression of SPI1 genes through direct interaction with HilD</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that <scope type="neg" id="2">the two known promoters of hilE were <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> modulated by Mlc</scope> , and we identified a third promoter , designated P3 , which was repressed by Mlc. The gel mobility shift assay and footprinting analysis revealed that Mlc repressed hilE in a direct manner by binding to two distinct sites in the hilE P3 promoter region .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The specific down-regulation of hilD observed in the presence of Mlc regulon-inducible sugars , such as glucose and mannose , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">could not</cue> be detected in the mlc mutant</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Based on these results , we <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">propose</cue> that Mlc functions to sense the availability of sugars and is linked to virulence gene regulation by its ability to control hilE expression in Salmonella</scope> .</sentence>
