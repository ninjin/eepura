<sentence id="0">The hilE P3 promoter is repressed by Mlc</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Baxter and Jones ( 18 ) have identified two independent hilE promoters , P1 and P2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We performed a primer extension assay of total RNA isolated from SL1344 grown to exponential phase in static culture , using the primer described by Baxter and Jones ( 18 ) , to discover which promoter is regulated by Mlc. The transcriptional start site of one transcript , designated P1 , agreed with the previous report , although the promoter activity was very low under the conditions used in our experiment ( Figure 4A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We detected a stronger transcript , designated P2 , upstream of P1 , although the transcription start site of P2 was mapped 12 nucleotides upstream of that reported by Baxter and Jones ( 18 ) ( Figures 4A and 5C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This difference could be attributed to differences in the experimental model conditions ; in our study , total RNA from a Salmonella strain was used in the primer extension assay , whereas Baxter and Jones ( 18 ) used total RNA prepared from E. coli harboring the hilE reporter plasmid pMAB69 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , <scope type="neg" id="0">the activities of the two promoters were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> changed by mlc mutation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using a primer extension assay with the hilE5 primer ( Table 2 ) , the promoter of hilE , which is designated as P3 , was newly identified ; this promoter initiates 335 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site of hilE ( Figure 4B , lane 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We observed <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> -10 ( TTAAAT</scope> ) and -35 ( ATAACA ) motifs for hilE P3 ( Figure 4C ) ( 37 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Transcription from the P3 promoter was increased substantially by mlc mutation ( Figure 4B , lane 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The specificity of the Mlc effect was verified by complementation , as the plasmid pKB , which expresses mlc , restored the transcriptional level of hilE in SR1304 almost to that of the wild-type strain ( Figure 4B , lane 4 ) .</sentence>
