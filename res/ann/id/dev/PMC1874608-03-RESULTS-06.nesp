<sentence id="0">Sugars that induce the Mlc regulon repress hilD expression by activating hilE</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Sequestration of Mlc by the unphosphorylated form of glucose permease , enzyme IICBGlc , is known to displace Mlc from its DNA-binding sites , thereby allowing transcription of its target genes ( 25-27 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Mlc regulon can be induced by glucose and , to a lesser extent , by mannose ( 39 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The effects of various carbon sources on the expression of hilE and hilD were studied with two Mlc regulon-inducing sugars , glucose and mannose , and two Mlc regulon-non-inducing carbohydrates , arabinose and glycerol .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">SL1344 and SR1304 carrying either pMAB69 ( hilE-lacZY ) or pJB5 ( hilD-lacZY ) were cultivated in TB that was buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.1M MOPS , to minimize pH effects arising from growth in the presence of the various carbon sources .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the wild-type strain , glucose and mannose increased hilE expression 2-fold and hilE activation reduced hilD expression ( Figure 6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The expression levels of hilE and hilD remained almost unaffected in the presence of glycerol .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , arabinose also activated hilE , albeit to a lesser degree than either glucose or mannose .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Nevertheless , this caused a minute increase in hilD expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of sugars</scope> , the mlc mutation increased hilE expression 1.5-fold , with a concomitant reduction in hilD expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">On the other hand , the expression in SR1304 of both hilE and hilD was increased in the presence of glucose , mannose or arabinose .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">imply</cue> that multiple regulatory pathways are involved in the regulation of hilE and hilD by carbohydrates</scope> .</sentence>
