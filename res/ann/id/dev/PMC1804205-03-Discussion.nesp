<sentence id="1">We have established that the sensor kinase PmrB is the primary sensor that activates the PmrA protein when Salmonella experiences mild acid pH , resulting in transcription of PmrA-activated genes ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="2"> <scope type="spec" id="1"> That PmrB is <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to sense changes in pH directly is <cue type="spec" id="2">supported</cue> by three findings</scope></scope> : ( i ) the mild acid pH-dependent activation of the PmrA-regulated gene pbgP was dramatically reduced in a strain <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> pmrB</scope> ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">3 ) , ( ii ) the periplasmic domain of PmrB was necessary for activation of pbgP under mild acid conditions ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">5 ) , and ( iii ) single amino acid substitutions in conserved histidine and glutamic acid residues located in the periplasmic domain of PmrB abolished its ability to stimulate pbgP transcription at pH 5.8 ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The periplasmic histidine and glutamates are conserved in the PmrB periplasmic domain of other enteric species , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">raising the</cue> possibility that <scope type="spec" id="4"> the signalling pathway described in this article <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be operating in other organisms in addition to S. enterica</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The requirement of periplasmic PmrB residues in the mild acid pH activation of PmrA-regulated genes <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that this signalling pathway responds to changes in extracytoplasmic pH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Moreover , under the experimental conditions used in this study it is <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">unlikely</cue> that the cytoplasmic pH varied significantly because : first , bacterial cells can maintain an internal pH of up to 2 units higher than the external pH ( Foster , 2004</scope> ) ; in fact , Slonczewski et al. ( 1981 ) determined that the intracellular pH in Escherichia coli cells was 7.4 even when the external pH was 5.5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Second , acid stress can become a severe challenge for bacterial cells when organic acids such as acetate or products of fermentation are present in the medium ( Bearson et al. , 1998 ) ; and in our experiments we used a non-fermentable sugar ( glycerol ) and inorganic acids which are <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> expected to cause such acid stress</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Structural changes driven by a relatively narrow variation in pH ( 1-2 units ) have been reported for several cytosolic bacterial proteins ( Tews et al. , 2005 ; Lu et al. , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This is in contrast to the few membrane proteins ( other than ion channels ) that have been shown to respond to changes in extracellular pH of a similar magnitude .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">For example , the eukaryotic G-protein coupled receptor OGR1 is inactive at pH 7.8 and fully active at pH 6.8 <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggesting</cue> that the pH sensing mechanism involves protonation of several extracytoplasmic histidines</scope> ( Ludwig et al. , 2003 ) , which is in agreement with the pKa of free histidine of approximately6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">In the case of PmrB , a normal response to mild acid pH requires not only a periplasmic histidine but also several glutamic acid residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Therefore , regulation of PmrB activity <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> involve protonation of one or more of these amino acids</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Even though protonation of the glutamic acid residues <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">seem</cue> <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">unlikely</cue> given the fact that the pKa of free glutamic acid is approximately4 , protein folding can change the pKa of its residues ( Tanford and Roxby , 1972</scope></scope></scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Indeed , the pKa of one of the glutamic acid residues of the regulatory protein TraM is approximately7.7 in the folded protein ( Lu et al. , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Therefore , it is <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">plausible</cue> that protonation/deprotonation of one or more of the glutamic acids in the periplasmic domain of PmrB <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">could</cue> occur at pH approximately5.8</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Integral membrane proteins that recognize signals in addition to extracytoplasmic pH , such as PmrB , have been identified both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">The CadC protein of E. coli , for example , is activated by exogenous lysine besides acid pH ( Dell et al. , 1994 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">Likewise , the human receptor OGR1 responds to both pH and sphingosylphosphorylcholine ( Ludwig et al. , 2003 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">The fact that the PmrB H35A and the E64A mutant proteins displayed partial activity in response to ferric iron but were severely impaired in their ability to respond to acid pH ( compare Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">6B and D ) supports the <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">notion</cue> that these signals are sensed independently</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">Similarly , cadC mutants have been isolated that are impaired in the ability to sense only one of its two inducing signals ( Dell et al. , 1994 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">Furthermore , the ability to sense two different compounds has also recently been shown to be genetically distinguishable in the bacterial chemoreceptor Tcp ( Iwama et al. , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">The PmrB protein plays the primary role in the pH-dependent activation of PmrA , but full activation also requires PmrD , the post-translational activator of the PmrA protein ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">The levels of phosphorylated PmrA are determined by the balance of the autokinase + phosphotransferase activity of PmrB and PmrB 's phosphatase activity towards phospho-PmrA .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">Thus , PmrD <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">may</cue> be necessary to ensure that the amount of phosphorylated PmrA is such to promote transcription of its regulated genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="30">Consistent with its role in acid pH activation , expression of the pmrD gene was promoted in media of mild acid pH ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="31">4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="32"><scope type="spec" id="17"> The mechanism(s) by which acid pH leads to an increase in the levels of the pmrD transcript , however , remains <cue type="spec" id="17">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="33">Although it has been <scope type="spec" id="19"> <cue type="spec" id="19">suggested</cue> that the Salmonella PhoQ protein senses acid pH ( Aranda et al. , 1992 ) or responds to both pH and Mg2+ ( Bearson et al. , 1998 ) , a direct role for PhoQ in responding to acid pH appears <scope type="spec" id="20"> <cue type="spec" id="20">unlikely</cue> because <scope type="neg" id="18"><cue type="neg" id="18">not</cue> all PhoP-regulated genes are activated under these conditions</scope> , which is in contrast to low Mg2+ activating the whole PhoP regulon ( see Groisman and Mouslim , 2006 for a review )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="34">What role could the pH-dependent activation of PmrA-regulated genes play in Salmonella 's lifestyle ?</sentence>
<sentence id="35">Because several PmrA-activated gene products are responsible for remodelling the LPS structure and these modifications are required for resistance to certain antimicrobial peptides and toxic metals , one <scope type="spec" id="21"> <cue type="spec" id="21">possibility</cue> is that acidic environments provide a means to induce the cell envelope changes resulting in resistance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="36">Indeed , when grown at pH 5.8 wild-type Salmonella were 100 000-fold more resistant to polymyxin B than when grown at pH 7.7 ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="37">7 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="38">This <scope type="spec" id="22"> <cue type="spec" id="22">may</cue> be particularly important for Salmonella living in soil due to the fact that the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B is produced by the soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa ( Paulus and Gray , 1964 ) and because the solubility of metals such as Fe3+ increases in acid pH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="39">On the other hand , although mild acid ( pH 6.0 ) per se , i.e. even in the presence of high Mg2+ , promotes LPS modifications ( Gibbons et al. , 2005 ) , the low pH signal <scope type="spec" id="24"> <cue type="spec" id="24">may</cue> also act synergistically with the low Mg2+ signal in vivo because Mg2+ deprivation alone is <scope type="neg" id="23"><cue type="neg" id="23">not</cue> sufficient to provide all the LPS modifications seen in Salmonella</scope> when present inside macrophages</scope> ( Gibbons et al. , 2005 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="40">Finally , while a role for the PmrA-dependent LPS modifications in the previously described acid tolerance response is <scope type="spec" id="28"> <cue type="spec" id="28">unlikely</cue> because <scope type="neg" id="25">survival to acid stress ( pH approximately3 ) was <cue type="neg" id="25">not</cue> reduced in cells deficient in pmrA</scope> <scope type="neg" id="26">( data <cue type="neg" id="26">not</cue> shown</scope> and Bearson et al. , 1998 ) , some of the PmrA-regulated genes to which <scope type="neg" id="27"><cue type="neg" id="27">no</cue> function has been ascribed yet could mediate other cellular responses to acid pH</scope></scope> .</sentence>
