<sentence id="0">Mild acid pH induces resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B</sentence>
<sentence id="1">What role could the mild acid pH-dependent activation of PmrA-regulated genes play in Salmonella 's lifestyle ?</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because the PmrA/PmrB system is required for resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B ( Roland et al. , 1993 ) , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that mild acid pH <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> induce this resistance</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In fact , the survival of wild-type cells to a challenge with polymyxin B was 100 000-fold higher when they were grown at pH 5.8 than when grown at pH 7.7 ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">7 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This resistance was PmrA-dependent because a strain deficient in the pmrA gene was approximately 100 000-fold more sensitive to polymyxin B than the wild-type strain when grown pH 5.8 ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">7 ) .</sentence>
