<sentence id="1">In this work we found that the alternative sigma factor , sigmaE , is involved in fine tuning the expressing of a subset of SsrB-regulated virulence genes required for Salmonella pathogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although the effect of rpoE deletion on promoter activity in some cases was mild , we have previously shown that gene regulators providing only modest transcriptional input have a profound influence on bacterial fitness in a host animal [ 25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In cases where the regulator is deleted , the loss of genetic fine-tuning causes incongruous changes in the timing and magnitude of virulence gene expression , leading to fitness loss and strong attenuation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We predict that RpoE confers a similar fine-tuning effect on Salmonella virulence gene expression that is required for optimal within-host fitness during infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When we examined the -10 and -35 positions of the promoters studied here relative to the transcriptional start sites identified previously [ 24 ] , <scope type="spec" id="1"> these promoters did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to contain sigmaE consensus sequences</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Instead <scope type="spec" id="2"> they <cue type="spec" id="2">appeared</cue> to have consensus sites for sigma70</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Although a bioinformatics screen identified sigmaE consensus sequences upstream of the SPI-2 genes ssaU , ssaJ , sscA and ssaC [ 26 ] , <scope type="neg" id="3">these genes were <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> tested for sigmaE-dependence in the present study because the identified consensus sites are in coding sequence within operons</scope> , and as a result <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> be directly relevant</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Due to the high degree of conservation in sigma factor binding sequences , sigmaE <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> be directly regulating SsrB-dependent promoters</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">lack</cue> of a canonical sigmaE sequence at these promoters</scope> <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggests</cue> that another regulatory gene <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> be epistatic to sigmaE</scope> or that these promoters encode functional , but non-canonical sigmaE-binding sites due to their horizontal acquisition and gradual integration into the sigmaE regulatory network</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This integration <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">may</cue> help Salmonella coordinate expression of the virulence-associated T3SS in response to host factors that compromise bacterial membrane integrity ( Figure 4 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This mechanism <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">would</cue> activate a restorative sigmaE pathway , which is consistent with the enhanced susceptibility of rpoE mutants to oxidative stress and antimicrobial peptides [ 13,15,16 ] , both of which perturb membrane integrity in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Although there is <scope type="neg" id="13"><cue type="neg" id="13">no</cue> evidence that sigmaE can directly repress transcription</scope> , the negative effect on two promoters observed here <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">might</cue> be due to an intermediate RpoE-regulated repressor or compensatory effect where loss of rpoE increases the relative abundance of another sigma factor that can directly activate the ssaG and srfN promoters</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Future work will be required to resolve these possibilities .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Our results <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">indicate that</cue> rpoE deletion has <scope type="neg" id="15"><cue type="neg" id="15">no</cue> effect on SsrB levels under SPI-2 inducing conditions <scope type="spec" id="17"> <cue type="spec" id="17">suggesting</cue> that the sigmaE pathway regulates effector expression downstream of ssrAB transcription</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Unlinking ssrAB transcription from the sigmaE regulon <scope type="spec" id="18"> <cue type="spec" id="18">would</cue> be advantageous to the cell to prevent commitment to a virulence gene expression program in response to envelope stress not associated with infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">The results from this study demonstrate that sigmaE has the ability to affect expression of SsrB-regulated virulence genes and offers potential insight into the virulence attenuation of rpoE mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Although when considered individually , each promoter was modestly affected by deletion of rpoE , the cumulative effects of mild rewired inputs on multiple virulence promoters has been shown to severely compromise in-host fitness and virulence ability [ 25 ] .</sentence>
