<sentence id="0">Decreased Resistance of DeltasalKR to PMN-Mediated Killing</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Together with the wild type strain , DeltasalKR was subjected to PMN-mediated killing assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found that the mortality rate of both strains ( WT and DeltasalKR ) increased coordinately with the extension of the co-culture time with PMN cells ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , DeltasalKR had a higher mortality rate than that of WT , which means that DeltasalKR was less able to resist killing by PMNs , key mediators of innate immunity .</sentence>
