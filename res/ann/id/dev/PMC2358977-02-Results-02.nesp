<sentence id="0">Transcriptional Analysis of the salKR Locus and its Flanking Sequences</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To confirm the predicted transcripts of salKR and the flanking genes , RNA extracted from S. suis 05ZYH33 cells was subjected to RT-PCR analysis by using primers amplifying each intergenic region of salKR and the flanking genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As shown in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">2B , RT-PCR products were obtained with five pairs of the primers ( P3/P4 , P5/P6 , P7/P8 , P9/P10 and P13/P14 ) , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> with the other three primer pairs ( P1/P2 , P11/P12 and P15/P16 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">On the other hand , when genomic DNA was used as a template , all these primer pairs yielded the expected PCR products ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">2B , PCR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that salK and salR are transcriptionally coupled , and the five downstream ( 05SSU0942-05SSU0938 ) genes are co-transcribed from a promoter positioned immediately upstream of 05SSU0942 and that their transcription ends between the 05SSU0938-05SSU0937 intergenic region which contains a terminator-like inverted repeat sequence</scope> .</sentence>
