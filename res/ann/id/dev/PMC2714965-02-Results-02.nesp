<sentence id="0">Screening the TB Transposon Library for Mutants Attenuated in Virulence</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A signature tagged mutagenesis ( STM ) library was previously generated in the virulent P. aeruginosa CF isolate , TB , using the plasposon vector pTnModOGm [ 20 ] , [ 35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Auxotrophic mutants were removed from the library by pre-screening post-conjugation TB isolates onto minimal media and selecting only clones , which grew normally .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This pre-screening eliminated clones that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> have exhibited attenuated virulence based upon reduced growth or viability , rather than loss of a specific virulence function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After this initial segregation , 2,200 clones were picked into a 96-well plate and tested with the C. elegans high throughput-killing assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Each mutant was tested at least four times using this assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The mutants selected were segregated into three groups based upon their level of virulence attenuation as compared to the TB parental strain , which killed 85 % of worms under the test conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In group 1 , we included 187 mutants ( 9 % of total library ) which allowed more than 50 % worm survival , group 2 between 30 % and 50 % ( 536 mutants , 25 % ) , and group 3 below 30 % ( 1450 mutants , 65 % ) , approaching the same level of killing as the parental isolate .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Within group 1 , the 12 most highly attenuated isolates , classified as group 1A ( 0.4 % of the total library ) , were further studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">When cultured in the presence of these mutants more than 70 % of worms survived , representing a near 5-fold reduction in virulence compared to TB .</sentence>
