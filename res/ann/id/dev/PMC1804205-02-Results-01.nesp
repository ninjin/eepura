<sentence id="1">Mild acid pH induces transcription of PmrA-regulated genes To examine the mild acid pH induction of PmrA-activated genes , we grew Salmonella cells harbouring chromosomal lacZYA transcriptional fusions to the PmrA-regulated genes pbgP , pmrC and ugd ( Wosten and Groisman , 1999 ) in N-minimal media buffered at pH 5.8 or 7.7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This medium <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacked</cue> Fe3+ or Al3+ , the only known PmrB ligands</scope> ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) , and contained 10 mM MgCl2 , which represses expression of PmrA-activated genes ( Soncini and Groisman , 1996 ; Kox et al. , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">All three genes were expressed when cells were grown in media buffered at pH 5.8 but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> at pH 7.7</scope> ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">2A-C ) , in agreement with previous results ( Soncini and Groisman , 1996 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A similar induction of pbgP transcription was found when MES was used as the buffering agent in the media at pH 5.8 <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">instead of</cue> Bis-Tris</scope> <scope type="neg" id="3">( data <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> shown )</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicating that</cue> the mild acid effect on gene expression was <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> due to a particular buffering system</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The transcriptional activation of PmrA-regulated genes taking place at pH 5.8 could be due to trace amounts of metals such as Fe3+ , which is more soluble at acidic pH .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To rule out this <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">possibility</cue> , we treated the culture medium with Chelex 100 resin , an agent known to chelate polyvalent metal ions that does <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> affect Salmonella growth</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We determined that Chelex 100 was effective at chelating iron because expression of the pmrA-independent iron-repressed iroA gene ( Hall and Foster , 1996 ) was induced to higher levels in cultures treated with Chelex 100 ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">2D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Expression of pbgP was still induced when Salmonella was grown in the Chelex-treated medium ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">2D ) or in media containing the specific Fe3+ chelator deferoxamine mesylate <scope type="neg" id="8">( data <cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> shown )</scope> supporting the <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">notion</cue> that mild acid pH is responsible for the observed induction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We determined that the regulatory protein PmrA is required for the transcriptional activation in response to mild acid pH because there was <scope type="neg" id="10"><cue type="neg" id="10">no</cue> induction of the three investigated genes in a pmrA mutant ( Fig</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">2A-C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Moreover , a mutant expressing a derivative of the PmrA protein that cannot be phosphorylated due to substitution of the <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">putative</cue> phosphorylation residue aspartate 51</scope> by alanine ( Kato and Groisman , 2004 ) completely <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">failed</cue> to promote transcription of PmrA-activated genes in response to pH 5.8</scope> , in a similar fashion to the pmrA strain ( A. Kato and E.A. Groisman , unpubl .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">results ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">From these results we conclude that Salmonella harbours a signalling pathway that responds to mild acid pH by activating the PmrA protein through phosphorylation .</sentence>
