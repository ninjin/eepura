<sentence id="1">Deletion of rpoE affects a subset of SsrB-regulated virulence genes Salmonella virulence gene expression is coordinated in vivo and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be regulated , in part , by alternative sigma factor(s) in order to quickly respond to the host environment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To date , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> sigma factor has been identified as regulating SsrB-dependent virulence genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To start , we first screened four alternative sigma factor mutants of S. Typhimurium ( rpoS , rpoN , rpoE , rpoH ) for their ability to express a key virulence gene , sseB , that requires SsrB for expression and whose gene product is essential for intracellular pathogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For an rpoH deletion , this strain was only viable at temperatures below 30degreesC .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since SPI-2 gene activation is integrated into a thermosensing circuit [ 19 ] we were <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">unable</cue> to test the role of sigmaH in this study <scope type="neg" id="3">( data <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In this screen , rpoS deletion resulted in a slight increase in SseB levels ( Figure 1A ) <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating</cue> a role for RpoS in the repression of SPI-2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Both rpoE and rpoN deletions resulted in decreased SseB levels with a more pronounced effect in the rpoE deletion .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Since we were predominantly interested in sigma factors that activate SPI-2 and <scope type="spec" id="5"> which <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> be linked to the previous observation that rpoE mutants are highly attenuated in vivo</scope> we choose to focus on RpoE in the current study , which had the most influence on SseB levels in the cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">An unmarked in-frame deletion of rpoE was then generated in S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 and we verified that this in-frame deletion had the same effect on SseB as the rpoE::cat mutant used previously ( Figure 1B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">A low-copy plasmid containing full-length rpoE and the three endogenous promoters that can drive its expression [ 20 ] was able to restore wild type levels of SseB to DeltarpoE cells ( Figure 1B ) demonstrating that the results were specific to the rpoE deletion .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In these complementation experiments , attempts were made to examine the levels of SseB secreted into the culture supernatant [ 21 ] , however consistent with previous observations [ 22,23 ] perturbations to the rpoE pathway increased cell lysis resulting in contamination of secreted fractions with cytosolic proteins which precluded accurate interpretation <scope type="neg" id="6">( data <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In order to examine the effect of sigmaE ( rpoE ) on the expression of a broad range of SsrB-regulated virulence genes , we tested <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">whether or</cue> not the effect of rpoE deletion was specific to sseB or if it extended to other SsrB-regulated genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">To do this we examined the levels of SseL-2HA , SifA-2HA and SrfN-2HA expressed from their endogenous promoters under SPI-2 inducing conditions ( Figure 1C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Consistent with the results for SseB , there was a decrease in SifA-2HA levels in DeltarpoE compared to wild type , although deletion of rpoE did <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> have an effect on SseL-2HA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Relative to its expression in wild type cells , the level of SrfN-2HA was reproducibly increased in the DeltarpoE cells , <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggesting</cue> a role for sigmaE in the repression of SrfN</scope> , although it is <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">unlikely</cue> that this is through a direct mechanism</scope> .</sentence>
