<sentence id="1">High Throughput Assay for Nematode Killing by P. aeruginosa It was reported earlier that relatively high-throughput screening procedures performed on plates could be used to identify virulence factors in various pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus [ 32 ] , P. aeruginosa [ 8 ] or Serratia marcescens [ 33 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we developed a high throughput screening method , in which C. elegans killing is assessed in a liquid assay and which allows a quick selection of attenuated candidates within large transposon libraries of P. aeruginosa .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We prepared a bacterial culture medium that both allowed the worms to thrive feeding on the non-pathogenic E. coli OP50 , and bacterial isolates being tested to have normal ( see Materials and Methods ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We filled 96 well plates with the medium and inoculated the bacterial strains to be tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The virulence of each isolate was assessed in a second microtitre plate , into which a specific population of nematodes had been deposited .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Evaluation of virulence was based upon the number of live worms recovered after 24 h exposure to bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Under our assay conditions , more than 90 % of the worms grown on E. coli were still alive after 24 h. In contrast , more than 50 % of the worms were killed within 24 h when cultured with any one of three isolates of P. aeruginosa , PA14 , PAO1 and TB <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In order to confirm that this assay would allow the recovery of P. aeruginosa mutants with an attenuated virulence , we tested previously characterized mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We used a gacA mutant from the PA14 transposon library ( http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/pa14/home.cgi ) [ 34 ] , which is affected in a gene encoding a response regulator involved in virulence [ 8 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">C. elegans infection using this mutant in the liquid assay resulted in only 40 % killing at 24 h , whereas 95 % killing was observed with the parental PA14 strain <scope type="neg" id="1">( data <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In order to screen a large number of bacterial isolates more rapidly , the assay was automated using the COPAS ( Complex Object Parametric Analyzer and Sorter ) Biosort system ( Union Biometrica ) (http://www.unionbio.com/). The sorter is able to dispatch systematically a fixed number of worms of a precise developmental stage , into each well of a microtitre plate .</sentence>
