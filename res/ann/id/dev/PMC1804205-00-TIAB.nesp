<sentence id="0">Acid pH activation of the PmrA/PmrB two-component regulatory system of Salmonella enterica</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Acid pH often triggers changes in gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , little is known about the identity of the gene products that sense fluctuations in extracytoplasmic pH .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium experiences a number of acidic environments both inside and outside animal hosts .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Growth in mild acid ( pH 5.8 ) promotes transcription of genes activated by the response regulator PmrA , but the signalling pathway(s) that mediates this response has thus far remained unexplored .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we report that this activation requires both PmrA 's cognate sensor kinase PmrB , which had been previously shown to respond to Fe3+ and Al3+ , and PmrA 's post-translational activator PmrD .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Substitution of a conserved histidine or of either one of four conserved glutamic acid residues in the periplasmic domain of PmrB severely decreased or abolished the mild acid-promoted transcription of PmrA-activated genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The PmrA/PmrB system controls lipopolysaccharide modifications mediating resistance to the antibiotic polymyxin B. Wild-type Salmonella grown at pH 5.8 were > 100 000-fold more resistant to polymyxin B than organisms grown at pH 7.7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that protonation of the PmrB periplasmic histidine and/or of the glutamic acid residues activate the PmrA protein , and that mild acid promotes cellular changes resulting in polymyxin B resistance</scope> .</sentence>
