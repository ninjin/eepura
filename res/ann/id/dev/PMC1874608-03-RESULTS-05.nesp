<sentence id="0">Mlc directly represses hilE by binding to the P3 promoter</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A gel mobility shift assay was performed with purified Mlc , to test <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> Mlc directly represses the hilE P3 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Mlc-His6 protein was produced in E. coli and purified to > 90 % homogeneity by Ni2+ affinity chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The activity of the purified Mlc-His6 protein was verified with the control gel mobility shift experiment employing the Salmonella ptsG DNA fragment that contains the known Mlc-binding site <scope type="neg" id="1">( data <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When the labeled hilE promoter DNA was incubated with 2-fold dilutions of the purified Mlc-His6 protein ( 100-800nM ) in the presence of the non-specific DNA competitor poly dI-dC , the concentration-dependent formation of protein-DNA complexes was observed ( Figure 5A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The addition of cold probe released the labeled probe from the retarded complex ( Figure 5A , right panel ) , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates</cue> specific binding of Mlc to the hilE P3 promoter DNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The precise locations of the Mlc-binding sites were determined by DNase I footprinting with His-tagged Mlc. Two Mlc-binding sites , one at position -10 to +12 ( Mlc 1 ) and the other at position -86 to -108 ( Mlc 2 ) with respect to the transcriptional start site of hilE P3 , were identified ( Figure 5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Inspection of the DNA sequences at these sites showed high-level homology with the known consensus Mlc-binding sequence , which has the conserved TT-9bp-AA motif and an AT-rich region at positions +/-7 to +/-11 , showing imperfect dyad symmetry ( 38 ) ( Figure 5C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results clearly demonstrate that Mlc can regulate directly the hilE P3 promoter by binding to the promoter .</sentence>
