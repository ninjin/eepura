<sentence id="0">SalK/SalR , a Two-Component Signal Transduction System , Is Essential for Full Virulence of Highly Invasive Streptococcus suis Serotype 2</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background Streptococcus suis serotype 2 ( S. suis 2 , SS2 ) has evolved into a highly infectious entity , which caused the two recent large-scale outbreaks of human SS2 epidemic in China , and is characterized by a toxic shock-like syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the molecular pathogenesis of this new emerging pathogen is still poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Methodology/Principal Findings 89K is a newly predicted pathogenicity island ( PAI ) which is specific to Chinese epidemic strains isolated from these two SS2 outbreaks .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Further bioinformatics analysis revealed a unique two-component signal transduction system ( TCSTS ) located in the candidate 89K PAI , which is orthologous to the SalK/SalR regulatory system of Streptococcus salivarius .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Knockout of salKR eliminated the lethality of SS2 in experimental infection of piglets .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Functional complementation of salKR into the isogenic mutant DeltasalKR restored its soaring pathogenicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Colonization experiments showed that the DeltasalKR mutant <scope type="spec" id="1"> <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0"><cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> not</cue> colonize any susceptible tissue of piglets when administered alone</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Bactericidal assays demonstrated that resistance of the mutant to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-mediated killing was greatly decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Expression microarray analysis exhibited a transcription profile alteration of 26 various genes down-regulated in the DeltasalKR mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Conclusions/Significance These findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that SalK/SalR is requisite for the full virulence of ethnic Chinese isolates of highly pathogenic SS2 , thus providing experimental evidence for the validity of this bioinformatically predicted PAI</scope> .</sentence>
