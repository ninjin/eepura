<sentence id="0">The expression levels of hilA , invF and hilD , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> of hilC</scope> , are decreased in the mlc mutant</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To identify the target gene in SPI1 that is regulated by Mlc , the expression patterns of the SPI1-regulatory genes , which include hilA , invF , hilC and hilD , were examined by primer extension analysis of total RNA from SL1344 and SR1304 grown statically to the exponential phase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The transcriptional start sites of these genes have been reported previously ( 12,16,35,36 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">SR1304 exhibited a > 10-fold reduction in hilA and HilA-dependent invF ( invFA ) expression , and about a 3-fold reduction in hilD and HilC/D-dependent invF ( invFD ) expression , compared to SL1344 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , hilC expression was unchanged ( Figure 2A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also observed reduced expression of the prgH and sigD genes , which are known to be regulated by HilA and InvF ( 10,11,29,35 ) , in SR1304 ( Figure 2B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The expression levels of hilA and invF were previously shown to be affected by both HilC and HilD ( 8,9,16 ) but since hilC levels are unaffected by the mlc mutation ( Figure 2A ) we speculated that Mlc was regulating hilA and invF expression indirectly <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">probably</cue> by modulating the expression of hilD or the higher regulator of hilD</scope> .</sentence>
