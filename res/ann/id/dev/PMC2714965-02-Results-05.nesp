<sentence id="0">Characterization of the cheB2 Mutant</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We chose to further characterize the TB0173s mutant ( cheB2 ) , as this isolate was affected in all phenotypes tested and thus exhibited a general motility and virulence defect ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To ensure that the cheB2 gene in the TB strain is located in a cluster similar to the che2 cluster described for the PAO1 or PA14 strains , we further analyzed the corresponding TB chromosomal region .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A series of 8 PCR reactions were performed using oligonucleotides based on the nucleotide sequence obtained from the PA14 genome sequence ( Table S1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The 8 PCR products were meant to cover the totality of the che2 cluster ( Figure 1 and Figure S2 ) starting from the mcpA gene to the PA0171 gene located downstream cheB2 ( PA0173 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The reactions were performed simultaneously using PA14 or TB genomic DNA as matrix .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Each paired reaction set ( TB/PA14 ) resulted in products running at the same migratory rate within the 1.5 % agarose gel <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results show that there is little difference between the two isolates , TB and PA14 , with regards the overall organization of the che2 chromosomal region .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">To validate that the loss of virulence and other phenotypic changes observed with the TB strain were a result of the transposon disruption of the cheB2 gene , we generated a new mutant by interrupting the cheB2 gene ( see Materials and Methods ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">As shown in Figure 3A , the newly engineered cheB2 mutant , called TB0173i ( p<0.005 ) , showed a delayed C. elegans killing comparable to the original STM cheB2 mutant TB0173s ( p<0.004 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Both cheB2 mutants , TB0173s and TB0173i , required at least one additional day , as compared to TB , to kill 50 % of exposed nematodes .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In addition , we engineered a similar cheB2 mutation in the P. aeruginosa PA14 strain , yielding PA140173i ( see Materials and Methods ) , and observed similar virulence attenuation on C. elegans ( Figure S3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This further confirmed the virulence phenotype of a cheB2 mutant and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> it is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> a TB strain-specific trait</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Finally , a complementation assay was performed .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">We reintroduced , in the cheB2 mutant , the wild-type cheB2 gene using an integration-proficient vector , mini-CTX1 [ 47 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">This vector contains the phiCTX attachment site allowing integration of exogenous DNA fragments at the attB site within the genome of P. aeruginosa .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">The cheB2 gene was cloned into the mini-CTX1 , yielding CTXp2B2 ( see Materials and Methods ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">This construct was introduced into the cheB2 mutant , TB0173s , generating the TB0173sp2B2 strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">The empty vector , mini-CTX1 , was also introduced into the TB0173s cheB2 mutant , generating TB0173sCTX .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">As shown in Figure 3B the virulence was restored in the complemented cheB2 mutant TB0173sp2B2 ( p<0.009 ) , whereas the cheB2 mutant strain TB0173sCTX ( p<0.005 ) remained fully attenuated .</sentence>
