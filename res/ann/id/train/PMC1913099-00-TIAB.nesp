<sentence id="1">Bacteria-host interactions are dynamic processes , and understanding transcriptional responses that directly <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> indirectly</scope> regulate the expression of genes involved in initial infection stages <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">would</cue> illuminate the molecular events that result in host colonization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We used oligonucleotide microarrays to monitor ( in vitro ) differential gene expression in group A streptococci during pharyngeal cell adherence , the first overt infection stage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We present neighbor clustering , a new computational method for further analyzing bacterial microarray data that combines two informative characteristics of bacterial genes that share common function or regulation : ( 1 ) similar gene expression profiles ( i.e. , co-expression ) ; and ( 2 ) physical proximity of genes on the chromosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This method identifies statistically significant clusters of co-expressed gene neighbors that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> share common function or regulation by coupling statistically analyzed gene expression profiles with the chromosomal position of genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We applied this method to our own data and to those of others , and we show that it identified a greater number of differentially expressed genes , facilitating the reconstruction of more multimeric proteins and complete metabolic pathways than <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">would</cue> have been <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possible</cue> <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> its application</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We assessed the biological significance of two identified genes by assaying deletion mutants for adherence in vitro and show that neighbor clustering indeed provides biologically relevant data .</sentence>
