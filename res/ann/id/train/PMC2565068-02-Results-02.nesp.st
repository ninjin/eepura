T1005	Span 913 1223	suggested that although PMN was detected in the lower well consisted of IL-8 and severe invasive GAS, but most of them were dead as defined by propidium iodine staining (p=0.016) (Figure 2A and 2C) demonstrating that severe invasive GAS affected survival of PMN and its migration activity in a transwell system
