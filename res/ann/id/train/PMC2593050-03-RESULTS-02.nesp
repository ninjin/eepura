<sentence id="0">Growth of DeltavicK in THY and Rabbit Blood</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The growth curve of the DeltavicK mutant in THY displays a longer early growth phase and smaller slope in the exponential growth phase than that of the parent strain ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">2A ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the vicK deletion detrimentally affects S. equi growth</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The effect of the deletion on S. equi growth in blood was also examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The wild-type and DeltavicK S. equi strains were inoculated into 1 ml heparinized rabbit blood at an inoculum of approximately 20,000 cfu .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The samples were incubated for 4 h , and the numbers of the bacteria in the samples and inocula at time zero were determined by plating .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The growth factors , the ratio of cfu in the sample at 4 h over cfu at time zero , were 250 and 66 for the wild type and DeltavicK strains , respectively ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">2B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , the DeltavicK mutant has significantly reduced ability to grow in rabbit blood ( P < 0.0001 ) .</sentence>
