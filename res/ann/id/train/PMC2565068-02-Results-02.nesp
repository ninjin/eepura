<sentence id="0">Severe invasive GAS rapidly induce necrosis to human PMN</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In an acute bacterial infection , PMN were quickly recruited at the site of infectious foci according to the gradient of chemoattractants .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , we examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> GAS clinically isolated from severe invasive infections <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> affect the migration ability of PMN in response to chemokines</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As a model of local infection of the initial phase , we utilized a transwell system and added IL-8 and GAS in culture medium within the lower wells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PMN were applied in the upper wells and subsequently incubated for 90 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">As shown in Figure 2A and 2B , a substantial number of PMN , consisted largely of viable cells , was detected in the lower wells consisted of IL-8 and non-invasive GAS , as a control .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Contrarily , number of PMN was significantly low in the presence of severe invasive GAS ( p=0.016 ) compared to that of control culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Flow cytometry analysis <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that although PMN was detected in the lower well consisted of IL-8 and severe invasive GAS , but most of them were dead as defined by propidium iodine staining ( p=0.016 ) ( Figure 2A and 2C ) demonstrating that severe invasive GAS affected survival of PMN and its migration activity in a transwell system</scope> .</sentence>
