<sentence id="0">Allelic Replacement of speH</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Increased expression of speH during pharyngeal cell adherence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that the SpeH exotoxin is either necessary for adherence , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> is a component of a downstream infection process</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Adherence-mediated upregulation of speH is <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> the result of phage induction</scope></scope> , as the remaining phage 370.2 genes identified in our analysis were downregulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">if</cue> SpeH plays a direct role in the adherence process</scope> , we created a deletion mutant in strain SF370 ( SF370DeltaspeH ) , which was confirmed by PCR ( unpublished data ) and RT-PCR ( Figure 1A ) and tested in vitro for adherence to human pharyngeal cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We observed <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> significant difference in adherence between the wild-type ( SF370 ) and mutant strains ( Figure 1B</scope> ) , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicating that</cue> <scope type="neg" id="6">SpeH is <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> involved directly in attachment to the pharyngeal cell</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The significant upregulation of the speH gene during adherence <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggests</cue> that the gene product <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> function instead during a subsequent stage of infection</scope></scope> .</sentence>
