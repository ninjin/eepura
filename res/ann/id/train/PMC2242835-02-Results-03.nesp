<sentence id="1">Changes in the regulatory potential of a pathogen are often accompanied by altered virulence .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In a first attempt to determine the virulence of the complemented H37Ra knock-in strains relative to wild-type H37Ra and H37Rv , bone marrow-derived murine macrophages ( BMM ) were infected with the different strains at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1:1 and 10:1 bacteria per cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As depicted in Figure 1 , macrophages were able to control ex vivo growth of H37Ra , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to control growth of H37Rv</scope> , confirming results from Freeman and colleagues [ 20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When H37Ra knock-ins were tested , important differences in their ex vivo growth characteristics were found .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Whereas H37Ra::fadE5 ( Figure 1 ) and H37Ra::rpsL ( unpublished data ) showed very little or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> growth over the 7-d period , the H37Ra::phoP mutant grew more vigorously , with a 7.5-fold increase in colony-forming units ( CFU ) over the 7-d period</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">From these experiments we concluded that complementation of H37Ra with the phoP wild-type copy partially restored its virulence , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> to the extent of the fully virulent H37Rv strain</scope> .</sentence>
