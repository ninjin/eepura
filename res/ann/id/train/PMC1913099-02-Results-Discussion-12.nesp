<sentence id="0">Neighbor Clustering and Operons</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although neighbor clustering is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> an operon-predicting method</scope> , we wanted to identify additional <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> operons among the groupings</scope> since neighbor clusters by definition share certain operon characteristics ( tandemly arranged genes , separated by < 300 bp , with similar expression patterns ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although operon-modeling methods exist [ 54,55 ] , we inspected clusters in silico for upstream regulatory elements and identified 17 candidates , including clusters such as streptolysin S that have been previously confirmed as operons [ 56 ] ; the spy0127-0130 grouping , which was confirmed as an operon in this study ; and others that have yet to be verified ( Table S6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Experimental confirmation of each candidate is beyond the scope of this study , but Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses could provide such information .</sentence>
