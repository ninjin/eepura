<sentence id="0">Incompetence of Neutrophils to Invasive Group A streptococcus Is Attributed to Induction of Plural Virulence Factors by Dysfunction of a Regulator</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Group A streptococcus ( GAS ) causes variety of diseases ranging from common pharyngitis to life-threatening severe invasive diseases , including necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The characteristic of invasive GAS infections has been <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">thought</cue> to attribute to genetic changes in bacteria</scope> , however , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> clear evidence has shown due to lack of an intriguingly study using serotype-matched isolates from clinical severe invasive GAS infections</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , rare outbreaks of invasive infections and their distinctive pathology in which infectious foci <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> neutrophil infiltration</scope> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesized</cue> us invasive GAS could evade host defense , especially neutrophil functions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Herein we report that a panel of serotype-matched GAS , which were clinically isolated from severe invasive but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> from non-invaive infections , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> abrogate functions of human polymorphnuclear neutrophils ( PMN ) in at least two independent ways</scope> ; due to inducing necrosis to PMN by enhanced production of a pore-forming toxin streptolysin O ( SLO ) and due to impairment of PMN migration via digesting interleukin-8 , a PMN attracting chemokine , by increased production of a serine protease ScpC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expression of genes was upregulated by a loss of repressive function with the mutation of csrS gene in the all emm49 severe invasive GAS isolates .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The csrS mutants from clinical severe invasive GAS isolates exhibited high mortality and disseminated infection with paucity of neutrophils , a characteristic pathology seen in human invasive GAS infection , in a mouse model .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , GAS which <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">lack</cue> either SLO or ScpC</scope> exhibit much less mortality than the csrS-mutated parent invasive GAS isolate to the infected mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggest</cue> that the abilities of GAS to abrogate PMN functions can determine the onset and severity of invasive GAS infection</scope> .</sentence>
