<sentence id="1">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the DeltavicK deletion affects the resistance of S. equi to phagocytosis by PMNs</scope> , the phagocytosis of wild-type and DeltavicK bacteria by PMNs in non-immune horse and rabbit blood was compared .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">FITC-labeled wild-type S. equi , DeltavicK mutant , and S. pyogenes spy1718::aad mutant were incubated with heparinized horse or rabbit blood for 5 and 15 min , and percentages of PMNs associated with fluorescent bacteria were quantified using flow cytometry analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The spy1718::aad mutant of S. pyogenes , which is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no longer</cue> resistant to phagocytosis by PMNs</scope> , was used as a positive control in the assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The percentages of PMNs with associated wild-type S. equi and spy1718::aad were low and high , respectively , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> the assay worked well to evaluate resistance of the bacteria to phagocytosis</scope> .</sentence>
