<sentence id="0">Transit through the Flea Vector Induces a Pretransmission Innate Immunity Resistance Phenotype in Yersinia pestis</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Yersinia pestis , the agent of plague , is transmitted to mammals by infected fleas .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Y. pestis exhibits a distinct life stage in the flea , where it grows in the form of a cohesive biofilm that promotes transmission .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">After transmission , the temperature shift to 37degreesC induces many known virulence factors of Y. pestis that confer resistance to innate immunity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These factors are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> produced in the low-temperature environment of the flea , however</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that Y. pestis is vulnerable to the initial encounter with innate immune cells at the flea bite site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we used whole-genome microarrays to compare the Y. pestis in vivo transcriptome in infective fleas to in vitro transcriptomes in temperature-matched biofilm and planktonic cultures , and to the previously characterized in vivo gene expression profile in the rat bubo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition to genes involved in metabolic adaptation to the flea gut and biofilm formation , several genes with known or predicted roles in resistance to innate immunity and pathogenicity in the mammal were upregulated in the flea .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Y. pestis from infected fleas were more resistant to phagocytosis by macrophages than in vitro-grown bacteria , in part attributable to a cluster of insecticidal-like toxin genes that were highly expressed only in the flea .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that transit through the flea vector induces a phenotype that enhances survival and dissemination of Y. pestis after transmission to the mammalian host</scope> .</sentence>
