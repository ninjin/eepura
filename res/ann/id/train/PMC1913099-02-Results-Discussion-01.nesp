<sentence id="1">Adherence-Mediated Differential Expression We developed spotted oligonucleotide arrays of the S. pyogenes SF370 ( an M1 serotype ) genome [ 14 ] and compared the transcriptomes of streptococci that adhere to Detroit 562 human pharyngeal cells to non-adherent ( " associated " ) streptococci within the same experiment .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Adherence assays were performed as described [ 15 ] with modifications to minimize eukaryotic cell disruption .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We replicated experiments independently and used dye-swaps to incorporate biological and technical variation [ 16,17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Following filtering and normalization [ 18,19 ] , we analyzed data from four biological replicates [ 16 ] with robust summary statistics [ 20 ] , Bayesian statistics [ 21,22 ] , and permutation algorithms [ 19 ] to identify genes differentially expressed with significance during pharyngeal cell adherence .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This analysis identified 79 genes ( 4 % of the genome ) exhibiting statistically significant fold changes in expression ( PF value < 0.05 ) during adherence from 1,769 open reading frames represented on the array ( Table 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We refer to such genes as " differentially expressed . "</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We present the entire dataset from all experiments as Table S1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Genes demonstrating upregulation ( n = 45 ) and downregulation ( n = 34 ) included virulence factors , prophage-encoded transcripts , metabolic genes , and transcriptional regulators ( Table 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Undefined or hypothetical genes comprised 27 % of differentially expressed genes ( n = 21 ; 11 chromosomally encoded genes , ten phage-encoded genes ) .</sentence>
