<sentence id="0">The growth-regulating property of M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is dependent on its ability to bind ATP</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We next sought to probe the relationship between the nucleotide-binding capacity and growth regulation by this mycobacterial USP .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Both the D15E and G117A mutant proteins were overexpressed in M. smegmatis mc2155 at levels equivalent to that of wild-type Rv2623 ( Figure S4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Results of these studies demonstrated that while overexpression of wildtype Rv2623 retards the growth of the recipient strain relative to cells transformed with vector alone , growth of the strains overexpressing ATP-binding-deficient mutant Rv2623 are only minimally affected by overexpression as assessed by spotting serial dilutions of the cultures of the appropriate strains onto solid Middlebrook 7H10 agar <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> as well as by monitoring the time to detection using the BD BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The distinct effects exhibited by the wild type and the G117A and D15E mutants defective in ATP binding <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> a direct correlation between growth attenuation and ATP binding ( Figure 7B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To examine <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> the effects of overexpression of Rv2623 on M. smegmatis are operative in virulent M. tuberculosis</scope> , the growth kinetics of the Erdman strain overexpressing wildtype Rv2623 , as well as the Rv2623G117A and the Rv2623D15E mutant proteins , were evaluated in vitro using the BACTEC 9000MB system ( Figure 8B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As in the M. smegmatis studies , the results show that overexpression of Rv2623 in M. tuberculosis results in marked retardation of growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , <scope type="neg" id="3">this growth attenuation is <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> observed in M. tuberculosis strains overexpressing the G117A or the D15E mutant Rv2623 ( Figure 8B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , these data strongly <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the ability of Rv2623 to regulate growth of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis is dependent on an ATP-dependent process</scope> .</sentence>
