<sentence id="0">Generation and analysis of ATP-binding-deficient Rv2623 mutants</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To explore the relationship between the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> ATP-dependent biochemical</scope> function of Rv2623 and the growth-regulating attribute of Rv2623 , we engineered mutations within the L1 ( D15E ) and beta4 ( G117A ) conserved residues <scope type="spec" id="1"> that were <cue type="spec" id="1">predicted</cue></scope> , on the basis of the crystal structure , to disrupt ATP recognition ( Figure 7A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In silico replacement of the beta4 G117 side chain hydrogen with a methyl group <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that any residue larger than glycine at this position is <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> to perturb both of the conserved loop regions in contact with the nucleotide</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Similarly , extension of the D15 side chain to glutamate was also <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">predicted</cue> to interfere with the ATP-binding conformation ( Figure 7A )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HPLC analysis of nucleotides extracted from Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A revealed that the mutant proteins are indeed deficient in ATP-binding , exhibiting approximately34 % ( p<0.001 ) and approximately29 % ( p=0.0018 ) of the amount of ATP bound by wild-type Rv2623 , respectively ( Figure 7B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Likewise , following an overnight incubation with [ alpha-33P ] ATP at 4degreesC , the amount of protein-bound radioactivity , which represented a very small fraction of the total ATP binding sites , was significantly less for the mutant proteins than wild-type Rv2623 <scope type="neg" id="5">( data <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Importantly , thermal denaturation profiles of wild-type Rv2623 , Rv2623D15E and Rv2623G117A demonstrated virtually identical Tm values , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">implying</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="6">the native Rv2623 fold was <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> destabilized by these mutations ( Figure 7C )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It is therefore <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">likely</cue> that the D15E and G117A mutations produced local structural changes in the ATP binding loops that contributed directly to the reduced levels of bound ATP in comparing to wild-type Rv2623</scope> .</sentence>
