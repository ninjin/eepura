<sentence id="0">Extracellular DNA Chelates Cations and Induces Antibiotic Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Biofilms are surface-adhered bacterial communities encased in an extracellular matrix composed of DNA , bacterial polysaccharides and proteins , which are up to 1000-fold more antibiotic resistant than planktonic cultures .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To date , extracellular DNA has been shown to function as a structural support to maintain Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm architecture .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that DNA is a multifaceted component of P. aeruginosa biofilms .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">At physiologically relevant concentrations , extracellular DNA has antimicrobial activity , causing cell lysis by chelating cations that stabilize lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and the outer membrane ( OM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">DNA-mediated killing occurred within minutes , as a result of perturbation of both the outer and inner membrane ( IM ) and the release of cytoplasmic contents , including genomic DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Sub-inhibitory concentrations of DNA created a cation-limited environment that resulted in induction of the PhoPQ- and PmrAB-regulated cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance operon PA3552-PA3559 in P. aeruginosa .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , DNA-induced expression of this operon resulted in up to 2560-fold increased resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and 640-fold increased resistance to aminoglycosides , but had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , the presence of extracellular DNA in the biofilm matrix contributes to cation gradients , genomic DNA release and inducible antibiotic resistance .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">DNA-rich environments , including biofilms and other infection sites like the CF lung , are <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> the in vivo environments where extracellular pathogens such as P. aeruginosa encounter cation limitation</scope> .</sentence>
