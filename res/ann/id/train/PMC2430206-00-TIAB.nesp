<sentence id="0">The GraRS regulatory system controls Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility to antimicrobial host defenses</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background Modification of teichoic acids with D-alanine by the products of the dlt operon protects Gram-positive bacteria against major antimicrobial host defense molecules such as defensins , cathelicidins , myeloperoxidase or phospholipase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The graRS regulatory genes have recently been implicated in the control of D-alanylation in Staphylococcus aureus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Results To determine the impact of the GraRS regulatory system on resistance to antimicrobial host defense mechanisms and virulence of S. aureus , we compared inactivation of S. aureus SA113 wild type and its isogenic graRS deletion mutant by the human cathelicidin LL-37 or human neutrophil granulocytes in vitro , and the ability to cause infection in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show here that graRS deletion considerably alters bacterial surface charge , increases susceptibility to killing by human neutrophils or the defense peptide LL-37 , and attenuates virulence of S. aureus in a mouse infection model .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Conclusion Our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> S. aureus can regulate its surface properties in order to overcome innate host defenses</scope> .</sentence>
