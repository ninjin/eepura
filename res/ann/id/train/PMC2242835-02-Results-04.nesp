<sentence id="0">Virulence Studies of H37Ra Complemented Mutants in a Mouse Model</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Further assessment of the in vivo growth of different H37Ra knock-in strains was carried out by intravenous infection of severe combined immuno-deficient ( SCID ) mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Complementation of H37Ra with the PhoP-expressing cosmid increased the virulence of the H37Ra::phoP recombinant relative to H37Ra , resulting in a 1.0 log and 0.5 log increase in CFU number in lungs and spleens , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effects on the virulence</scope> were observed when H37Ra was complemented with fadE5 ( Figure 2 ) or rpsL ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , as already observed in macrophages , integration of phoP did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> restore levels of virulence to those of the reference strain H37Rv ( Figure 2 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This situation is also reflected in the sizes of spleens , which correlate with the CFU data in spleens ( Figure S4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Together with the data from the macrophage infection assay , the results from the mouse infection show that the S219L mutation in the phoP gene definitely represents one genetic lesion that contributed to the attenuation of the H37Ra strain .</sentence>
