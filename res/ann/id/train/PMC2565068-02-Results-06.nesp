<sentence id="0">csrS mutation is important in the pathogenesis of invasive infections in a mouse model</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In order to elucidate the role of csrS , in infections in vivo , we compared the virulence of GAS isolates using a mouse model which infected GAS intraperitoneally .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The non-invasive 1566 strain displayed the LD50 value approximately 100-fold higher than that of the severe invasive NIH230 strain ( Table 1 ) , whereas a csrS deletion ( 1566DeltacsrS ) caused an increase in the LD50 value comparable to that of the NIH230 strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Consistently , an introduction of the intact csrS gene into the NIH230 strain ( NIH230::csrS+ ) reduced the LD50 value to the level observed in the non-invasive strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> csrS is an important virulence factor in the mouse model of lethal infections</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">As shown in Figure 7A , the NIH230 strain caused bacteremia in mice 24 h after intraperitoneal injection whereas the bacteremia was barely detected in mice infected with NIH230::csrS+as well as the 1566 strain ( p=0.005 compared with non-invasive isolates , and p=0.005 compared with invasive isolates +CsrS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Histopathologically , in the mice injected with the NIH230 strain , bacteria formed clusters in interstitial tissues in the kidneys and the lungs , accompanied congestion and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> inflammatory cells at infectious foci</scope> ( Figure 7B , 7C and data <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Contrarily , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> significant pathological alterations were observed in the mice injected with the 1566 and NIH230::csrS+ strains ( Figure 7B and 7C )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Figure 7D shows that subcutaneous infection of NIH230 formed the infected lesions with area significantly larger than those of 1566 and NIH230::csrS+ .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the invasive GAS isolates are more virulent in vivo than non-invasive GAS , and impair PMN function in vivo , owing , at least in part , to the mutations in the csrS gene</scope> .</sentence>
