<sentence id="0">Effects of environmental stress on growth of M. tuberculosis Deltarv2623 in vitro</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although the functions of universal stress proteins have yet to be completely defined , there is evidence that many USPs play differential roles in protecting microbes against various environmental stresses [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , the hypervirulence of Deltarv2623 in guinea pigs and susceptible mice is intriguing ; if Rv2623 provides M. tuberculosis protection against stress , <scope type="spec" id="0"> it <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> be expected that <scope type="spec" id="1"> the Rv2623-deficient mutant <cue type="spec" id="1">would</cue> be attenuated in vivo</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The growth kinetics and survival of the Deltarv2623 strain was examined under various stress conditions , including those <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to be present during M. tuberculosis infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These included oxidative stress ( superoxide anion , O2- ) , DNA damage ( UV irradiation , mitomycin C ) , heat shock ( 53degreesC ) , and acidic culture ( pH 4.0 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The use of streptonigrin , an antibiotic whose toxicity correlates with levels of free iron , was based on the observation that the intracellular environment of macrophages can induce a iron-scavenging response in mycobacteria [ 25 ] , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">perhaps</cue> as a means of maintaining adequate levels of this important growth factor</scope> , and that an E. coli USP was shown to regulate iron uptake [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results showed that the mutant strain was <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> more susceptible to growth inhibition than was wild type Erdman under all of the stress conditions tested ( Figure S2</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results support the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">notion</cue> that it is <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">unlikely</cue> that M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is essential for resistance to stresses encountered in the host , which is consistent with the observed in vivo hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623</scope></scope> .</sentence>
