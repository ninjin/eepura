E1000	Speculation:T1000 Scope:T1001
T1001	Span 473 632	suggests that many of the regulators may function on SPI-2 through SlyA activation of ssrB or alternatively via both regulators (slyA and ssrB) acting together

T1004	Speculation 930 940	suggesting
E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 930 1035	suggesting that the effect of these regulators on SPI-2 expression may be indirect via regulation of slyA

E1003	Speculation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 510 632	may function on SPI-2 through SlyA activation of ssrB or alternatively via both regulators (slyA and ssrB) acting together
