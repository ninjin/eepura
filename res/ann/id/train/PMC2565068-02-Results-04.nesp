<sentence id="0">Impaired migration of PMN is due to degradation of IL-8 by serine proteinase ScpC</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although NIH230slo lost the killing activity for PMN , <scope type="neg" id="0">migration of PMN in response to IL-8 in a transwell system was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> restored in the presence of this mutant</scope> ( Figure 4A ) , thereby , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that severe invasive GAS blocks PMN migration by influence on IL-8 activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , we quantified the amount of IL-8 in culture before and after co-culture with clinically isolated GAS or its mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Figure 4B shows that the amount of IL-8 was significantly reduced by 60-min co-culture with NIH230 , as well as NIH230slo , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> with non-invasive GAS 1556</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As previous reports <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> that the GAS envelope peptidase ScpC ( also known as SpyCEP ) degrades the CXC chemokines , such as human IL-8 , Groalpha , murine KC and MIP-2 [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] , we established a NIH230 mutant deficient with ScpC ( NIH230scpC ) and analyzed the property in a PMN migration assay</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results showed that NIH230scpC <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">neither</cue> digested IL-8 , like 1566 strain , ( Figure 4B ) <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">nor</cue> abrogated the migration of PMN in response to IL-8 , comparable to 1566 strain ( Figure 4A ) , whereas the mutant killed the migrated PMN as well as the parent strain NIH230 <scope type="neg" id="6">( data <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results demonstrate that clinically isolated invasive GAS impaired PMN recruitment and its survival , as a result of productions of ScpC and SLO , respectively .</sentence>
