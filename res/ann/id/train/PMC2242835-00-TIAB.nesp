<sentence id="0">Control of M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 Secretion and Specific T Cell Recognition by PhoP</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Analysis of mycobacterial strains that have lost their ability to cause disease is a powerful approach to identify yet <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> virulence determinants and pathways involved in tuberculosis pathogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Two of the most widely used attenuated strains in the history of tuberculosis research are Mycobacterium bovis BCG ( BCG ) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra ( H37Ra ) , which both lost their virulence during in vitro serial passage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Whereas the attenuation of BCG is due mainly to loss of the ESAT-6 secretion system , ESX-1 , the reason why H37Ra is attenuated remained <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , here we show that a point mutation ( S219L ) in the predicted DNA binding region of the regulator PhoP is involved in the attenuation of H37Ra via a mechanism that impacts on the secretion of the major T cell antigen ESAT-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Only H37Ra " knock-ins " that carried an integrated cosmid with the wild-type phoP gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv showed changes in colony morphology , increased virulence , ESAT-6 secretion , and induction of specific T cell responses , whereas other H37Ra constructs did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This finding established a link between the PhoP regulator and ESAT-6 secretion that opens exciting new perspectives for elucidating virulence regulation in M. tuberculosis .</sentence>
