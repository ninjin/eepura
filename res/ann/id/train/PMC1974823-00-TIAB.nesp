<sentence id="0">Porphyromonas gingivalis short fimbriae are regulated by a FimS/FimR two-component system</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Porphyromonas gingivalis possesses two distinct fimbriae .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The long ( FimA ) fimbriae have been extensively studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Expression of the fimA gene is tightly controlled by a two-component system ( FimS/FimR ) through a cascade regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The short ( Mfa1 ) fimbriae are less understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The authors have recently demonstrated that both fimbriae are required for formation of P. gingivalis biofilms .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Here , the novel finding that FimR , a member of the two-component regulatory system , is a transcriptional activator of the mfa1 gene is promoted .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Unlike the regulatory mechanism of FimA by FimR , this regulation of the mfa1 gene is accomplished by FimR directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1 .</sentence>
