<sentence id="0">A Novel Signaling Network Essential for Regulating Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Development</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The important human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been linked to numerous biofilm-related chronic infections .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we demonstrate that biofilm formation following the transition to the surface attached lifestyle is regulated by three previously undescribed two-component systems : BfiSR ( PA4196-4197 ) harboring an RpoD-like domain , an OmpR-like BfmSR ( PA4101-4102 ) , and MifSR ( PA5511-5512 ) belonging to the family of NtrC-like transcriptional regulators .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These two-component systems become sequentially phosphorylated during biofilm formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Inactivation of bfiS , bfmR , and mifR arrested biofilm formation at the transition to the irreversible attachment , maturation-1 and -2 stages , respectively , as indicated by analyses of biofilm architecture , and protein and phosphoprotein patterns .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , discontinuation of bfiS , bfmR , and mifR expression in established biofilms resulted in the collapse of biofilms to an earlier developmental stage , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> a requirement for these regulatory systems for the development and maintenance of normal biofilm architecture</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , inactivation did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect planktonic growth , motility , polysaccharide production , or initial attachment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Further , we demonstrate the interdependency of this two-component systems network with GacS ( PA0928 ) , which was found to play a dual role in biofilm formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This work describes <scope type="spec" id="2"> a novel signal transduction network regulating committed biofilm developmental steps following attachment , in which phosphorelays and two sigma factor-dependent response regulators <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to be key components of the regulatory machinery that coordinates gene expression during P. aeruginosa biofilm development in response to environmental cues</scope> .</sentence>
