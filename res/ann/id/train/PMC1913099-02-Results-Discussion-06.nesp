<sentence id="0">Differential Expression of Genes from Diverse Functional Categories</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We identified a number of genes encoding proteins involved in housekeeping processes ( such as carbohydrate and coenzyme metabolism ) that were differentially expressed , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> a shift in metabolic processes due to host cell adherence ( Tables 1 and 2 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">For example , genes encoding proteins involved in folate biosynthesis [ 40 ] were upregulated , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that certain cofactors that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be necessary during adherence</scope> were unavailable</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Also upregulated were genes encoding subunits of the F0F1 ATPase [ 41 ] ( discussed in more detail later ) , which <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate</cue> an acid stress response to maintain cytoplasmic pH or a need to generate ATP in response to increased energy requirements</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also identified the adherence-mediated upregulation of four transcriptional regulators ( Table 1 ) , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggestive</cue> of an adaptive response</scope> to host cell contact that is dynamic and complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">For example , RopB ( encoded by spy2042 ) , a member of the Rgg family of response regulators , interacts with a number of regulatory networks throughout the streptococcal genome ( e.g. , mga , csrRS , sagA , and fasBCA ) , affecting the transcription of numerous proteins , virulence factors , and two-component regulatory systems [ 42,43 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although the delineation of genes influenced by RopB ( or any identified transcriptional regulator ) is beyond the scope of this study , our initial analysis did identify the upregulation of a two-component regulatory system , encoded by spy1236-1237 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="6">The functions of these particular loci are <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> yet known</scope> , and their adherence-mediated upregulation represents new targets in the study of regulators that function during host cell contact .</sentence>
