T1003	Span 557 829	not likely to affect transcription of neighboring genes, given the sequence-confirmed precise excision of the rv2623 coding region and the gene organization at the rv2623 locus (the downstream rv2624c is transcribed in the direction opposite to that of rv2623) (Figure 1B)

T1007	Span 1263 1392	a potential growth-regulating attribute of Rv2623 might be masked by functional redundancy among the M. tuberculosis USP homologs
