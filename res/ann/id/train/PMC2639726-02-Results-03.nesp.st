T1009	Span 2677 2827	suggests that normally the regulator activates transcription of these genes as is shown dramatically in Figure 3 for all SPI-2 encoded virulence genes

T1013	Span 3172 3365	suggest that the normal function of each of the 14 regulators is to activate transcription of virulence factors necessary for systemic infection but only under specific environmental conditions
