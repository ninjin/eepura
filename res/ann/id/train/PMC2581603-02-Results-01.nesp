<sentence id="1">Extracellular DNA has antimicrobial activity To study the role of the matrix component DNA on biofilm formation and biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance , we first examined the influence of extracellular DNA on P. aeruginosa growth in rich and defined media , LB and BM2 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Addition of 0.5 % ( w/v ) ( 5 mg/ml ) or greater extracellular DNA to LB or 1 % ( w/v ) or greater DNA to BM2 media inhibited growth of P. aeruginosa ( Fig 1A and 1B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The kinetics of killing by extracellular DNA was determined by measuring the loss of luminescence from a chromosomally-tagged luminescent P. aeruginosa strain , PAO1::p16Slux .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DNA-mediated killing was fast , within minutes , as measured by the rapid loss of luminescence upon exposure to 1.25 % ( w/v ) DNA , or greater ( Fig 1C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Killing was dose-dependent , with faster killing observed as the DNA concentration increased ( Fig 1C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The rapid decrease in luminescence corresponded with a loss of bacterial viability , as determined by plating ( Fig 1D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">One percent ( w/v ) extracellular DNA in LB also inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cenocepacia <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that the antimicrobial activity of DNA is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> unique to P. aeruginosa</scope></scope> .</sentence>
