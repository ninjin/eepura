<sentence id="0">BCL-6 , a POZ/zinc-finger protein , is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Approximately 40 % of diffuse large cell lymphoma are associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate the expression of the BCL6 gene by juxtaposing heterologous promoters to the BCL-6 coding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The BCL6 gene encodes a 95-kDa protein containing six C-terminal zinc-finger motifs and an N-terminal POZ domain , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that it <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> function as a transcription factor</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By using a DNA sequence selected for its ability to bind recombinant BCL-6 in vitro , we show here that BCL-6 is present in DNA-binding complexes in nuclear extracts from various B-cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In transient transfectin experiments , BCL6 can repress transcription from promoters linked to its DNA target sequence and this activity is dependent upon specific DNA-binding and the presence of an intact N-terminal half of the protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrate that this part of the BCL6 molecule contains an autonomous transrepressor domain and that two noncontiguous regions , including the POZ motif , mediate maximum transrepressive activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> the BCL-6 protein <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">can</cue> function as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor</scope></scope> and have implications for the role of BCL6 in normal lymphoid development and lymphomagenesis .</sentence>
