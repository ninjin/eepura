<sentence id="0">Jak3 is associated with CD40 and is critical for CD40 induction of gene expression in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD40 is a receptor that is critical for the survival , growth , differentiation , and isotype switching of B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation , which is necessary for several CD40-mediated events .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that engagement of CD40 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Jak3 is constitutively associated with CD40 , and this interaction requires a proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Deletion of this sequence abolishes the capacity of CD40 to induce expression of CD23 , ICAM-1 , and lymphotoxin-alpha genes in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> signaling through Jak3 is activated by CD40 and plays an important role in CD40-mediated functions</scope> .</sentence>
