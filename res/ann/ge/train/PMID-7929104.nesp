<sentence id="0">Regulation of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain expression and nuclear factor.kappa B activation by protein kinase C in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Autocrine role of tumor necrosis factor alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The regulation of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain ( IL-2R alpha ) expression and nuclear factor ( NF ) activation by protein kinase C ( PKC ) in resting T cells , has been studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Treatment of human resting T cells with phorbol esters strongly induced the expression of IL-2R alpha and the activation of NF.kappa B. This activation was due to the translocation of p65 and c-Rel NF.kappa B proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus , where they bound the kappa B sequence of the IL-2R alpha promoter either as p50.p65 or as p50.c-Rel heterodimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , all of those events were largely indirect and mediated by endogenously secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , as they were strongly inhibited by a neutralizing anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , cyclosporin A , which blocked TNF alpha production induced by PKC , strongly inhibited IL-2R alpha and NF.kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The addition of either TNF alpha or IL-2 partially recovered cyclosporin A-induced IL-2R alpha inhibition , but only TNF alpha completely recovered NF.kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Those results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> , in resting T cells , PKC activation has only a triggering role , whereas the endogenously secreted TNF alpha plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of IL-2R alpha chain or NF.kappa B activation</scope> .</sentence>
