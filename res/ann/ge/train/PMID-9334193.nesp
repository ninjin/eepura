<sentence id="0">Monochloramine inhibits phorbol ester-inducible neutrophil respiratory burst activation and T cell interleukin-2 receptor expression by inhibiting inducible protein kinase C activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Monochloramine derivatives are long lived physiological oxidants produced by neutrophils during the respiratory burst .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The effects of chemically prepared monochloramine ( NH2Cl ) on protein kinase C ( PKC ) and PKC-mediated cellular responses were studied in elicited rat peritoneal neutrophils and human Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Neutrophils pretreated with NH2Cl ( 30-50 microM ) showed a marked decrease in the respiratory burst activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , which is a potent PKC activator .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These cells , however , were viable and showed a complete respiratory burst upon arachidonic acid stimulation , which induces the respiratory burst by a PKC-independent mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The NH2Cl-treated neutrophils showed a decrease in both PKC activity and PMA-induced phosphorylation of a 47-kDa protein , which corresponds to the cytosolic factor of NADPH oxidase , p47(phox) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Jurkat T cells pretreated with NH2Cl ( 20-70 microM ) showed a decrease in the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain following PMA stimulation .</sentence>
