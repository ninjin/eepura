<sentence id="0">Differential autoregulation of glucocorticoid receptor expression in human T- and B-cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulation of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) expression by its cognate ligand was examined in the glucocorticoid-sensitive human leukemic T-cell line 6TG1.1 and in the human B-cell line IM-9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In contrast to the decrease in GR mRNA seen in IM-9 cells after treatment with 1 microM dexamethasone for 16-18 h , treatment of 6TG1.1 cells resulted in an 8-fold increase in GR mRNA , as determined by Northern blot and RNase protection analysis , with a corresponding 3- to 4-fold increase in GR protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Half-maximal induction of GR mRNA and protein in 6TG1.1 cells was observed between 10-100 nM dexamethasone , and inclusion of 1 microM RU 38486 completely blocked the effects of 100 nM dexamethasone , demonstrating that positive autoregulation of GR expression in 6TG1.1 cells is a receptor-mediated response .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Positive autoregulation of GR expression was also observed in glucocorticoid-resistant CEM-C1 cells , which contain functional GR , but whose growth is unaffected by glucocorticoids .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , positive autoregulation is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">neither</cue> a consequence <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">nor</cue> the sole cause of growth arrest</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The degree of negative autoregulation in IM-9 cells and positive autoregulation in 6TG1.1 cells was unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Measurement of GR mRNA turnover in 6TG1.1 cells treated with actinomycin-D revealed a half-life of 2.5 h , which was unaffected by dexamethasone treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A similar half-life was determined in IM-9 cells and was also unaffected by steroid treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results are consistent with the interpretation that glucocorticoid-mediated autoregulation of GR expression is a tissue-specific primary transcriptional response .</sentence>
