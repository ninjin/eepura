<sentence id="0">Tobacco smoke induces coordinate activation of HSF and inhibition of NFkappaB in human monocytes : effects on TNFalpha release .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tobacco smoke ( TS ) exposure is a major risk factor for human disease , and macrophages of healthy smokers have a depressed capacity to release cytokines , including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">TS induces the synthesis of heat shock (HS)/stress proteins ( HSP ) , and , in particular , of Hsp70 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We determined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> Hsp70 induction by TS was mediated by the activation of the HS transcription factor , HSF</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HSF activation has been shown to inhibit NFkappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , we also determined the effects of TS on NFkappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">U937 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes were exposed to TS , binding activities of the respective transcription factors were analyzed , and Hsp70 expression and TNFalpha release were determined in parallel .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">TS activated HSF , which was associated with Hsp70 overexpression and inhibition of NFkappaB binding activity and TNFalpha release .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The altered cytokine profile observed in smokers <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> relate to an HSF/Hsp70-mediated inhibition of NFkappaB activity</scope> .</sentence>
