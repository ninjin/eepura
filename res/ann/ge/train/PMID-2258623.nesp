<sentence id="0">Differences in transcriptional enhancers of HIV-1 and HIV-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Response to T cell activation signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">T cell activation results in high levels of HIV replication and <scope type="spec" id="0"> is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be one mechanism leading to the conversion from latent to active viral infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In HIV-1 , the sequences that respond to these signaling events are found in the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and comprise the transcriptional enhancer , which contains two conserved binding sites for the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The corresponding region in the second AIDS retrovirus , HIV-2 , contains a conserved and a divergent NF kappa B binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrate that the HIV-1 LTR responds better than the HIV-2 LTR to T cell activation signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These qualitative differences in the response to T cell activation are reproduced not only when HIV-1 or HIV-2 enhancers are placed upstream of a heterologous promoter but also when these enhancers are switched between their respective LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , NF kappa B binds to both conserved sites in the HIV-1 transcriptional enhancer and only to the single conserved site in the HIV-2 transcriptional enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Instead of NF kappa B , the activator protein 3 binds to the divergent site in HIV-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In conclusion , HIV-1 and HIV-2 are differentially regulated by T cell activation signals , and this difference <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> account for the longer period of viral latency observed with HIV-2 than with HIV-1 infection</scope> .</sentence>
