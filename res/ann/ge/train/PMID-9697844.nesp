<sentence id="0">Targeted disruption of the MyD88 gene results in loss of IL-1- and IL-18-mediated function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">MyD88 , originally isolated as a myeloid differentiation primary response gene , is shown to act as an adaptor in interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) signaling by interacting with both the IL-1 receptor complex and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase ( IRAK ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Mice generated by gene targeting to <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> MyD88</scope> have defects in T cell proliferation as well as induction of acute phase proteins and cytokines in response to IL-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Increases in interferon-gamma production and natural killer cell activity in response to IL-18 are abrogated .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In vivo Th1 response is also impaired .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , IL-18-induced activation of NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) is blocked in MyD88-/- Th1-developing cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , these results demonstrate that MyD88 is a critical component in the signaling cascade that is mediated by IL-1 receptor as well as IL-18 receptor .</sentence>
