<sentence id="0">Downstream activation of a TATA-less promoter by Oct-2 , Bob1 , and NF-kappaB directs expression of the homing receptor BLR1 to mature B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The chemokine receptor , BLR1 , is a major regulator of the microenvironmental homing of B cells in lymphoid organs .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In vitro studies identify three essential elements of the TATA-less blr1 core promoter that confer cell type- and differentiation-specific expression in the B cells of both humans and mice , a functional promoter region ( -36 with respect to the transcription start site ) , a NF-kappaB motif ( +44 ) , and a noncanonical octamer motif ( +157 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The importance of these sites was confirmed by in vivo studies in gene-targeted mice deficient of either Oct-2 , Bob1 , or both NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p52 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In all of these animals , the expression of BLR1 was reduced or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absent</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In mice deficient only of p52/NF-kappaB , BLR1 expression was unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus our data demonstrate that BLR1 is a target gene for Oct-2 , Bob1 , and members of the NF-kappaB/Rel family and provides a link to the impaired B cell functions in mice deficient for these factors .</sentence>
