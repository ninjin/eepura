<sentence id="0">Functional block for 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated gene regulation in human B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Elements necessary for the steroid hormone 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25-(OH)2D3 ) to induce a biological response include the presence of specific intracellular receptors ( vitamin D3 receptors ( VDR ) ) and modulation of gene expression via hormone-activated receptor binding to regulatory regions of target genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These parameters were examined in normal and Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized human B cells and compared with 1 alpha , 25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells of the T and monocytic lineages .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although resting tonsillar B cells did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> express VDR mRNA</scope> , activation of these cells with interleukin-4 induced VDR in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of exogenously supplemented 1 alpha , 25-(OH)2D3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As indicators of hormone-mediated gene regulation we analyzed modulation of CD23 , a common B cell/monocyte surface antigen , and 24-hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">1 alpha , 25-(OH)2D3 inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells , yet <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">failed</cue> to modulate CD23 expression in B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , 1 alpha , 25-(OH)2D3 induced 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin-activated T cells , yet <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">failed</cue> to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that although human B lymphocytes can express VDR mRNA and protein , they exhibit a functional block for vitamin D-dependent gene regulation</scope> .</sentence>
