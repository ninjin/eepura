<sentence id="1">Clinical deterioration in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection is associated with increased levels of viral replication and burden in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">T cell activation and ensuing cellular gene activation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> be critical for HIV-1 replication</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> influence HIV-1 replication</scope></scope> is therefore compelling given the tight correlation of HIV-1 transcriptional induction to T cell activation .</sentence>
