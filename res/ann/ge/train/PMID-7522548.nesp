<sentence id="0">Antioxidants inhibit monocyte adhesion by suppressing nuclear factor-kappa B mobilization and induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in endothelial cells stimulated to generate radicals .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) is due to induction of surface receptors , such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) specifically inhibits activation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Since kappa B motifs are present in VCAM-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) promoters , we used PDTC to study the regulatory mechanisms of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 induction and subsequent monocyte adhesion in TNF-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PDTC or N-acetylcysteine dose dependently reduced TNF-induced VCAM-1 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> ICAM-1 surface protein ( also in human umbilical arterial endothelial cells ) and mRNA expression ( by 70 % at 100 mumol/L PDTC ) in HUVECs as assessed by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Gel-shift analysis in HUVECs demonstrated that PDTC prevented NF-kappa B mobilization by TNF , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that only VCAM-1 induction was controlled by NF-kappa B.</scope> Since HUVECs released superoxide anions in response to TNF , and H2O2 induces VCAM-1 , PDTC <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> act as a radical scavenger</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although ICAM-1 induction was unaffected , inhibitors of NADPH oxidase ( apocynin ) or cytochrome P-450 ( SKF525a ) suppressed VCAM-1 induction by TNF , revealing that several radical-generating systems are involved in its regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">PDTC , apocynin , or SKF525a decreased adhesion of monocytic U937 cells to TNF-treated HUVECs ( by 75 % at 100 mumol/L PDTC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Inhibition by anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody 1G11 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> U937 adhesion was VCAM-1 dependent and suppression by antioxidants was due to reduced VCAM-1 induction</scope> .</sentence>
