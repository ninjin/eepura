<sentence id="0">Agonistic activity of a CD40-specific single-chain Fv constructed from the variable regions of mAb G28-5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A single-chain Fv ( sFv ) was expressed from the variable regions of the CD40-specific mAb G28-5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The molecule bound CD40 with a high affinity ( 2.2 nM ) and was a monomer in solution .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Surprisingly , G28-5 sFv was a potent CD40 agonist that rapidly crosslinked CD40 on the cell surface but did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> crosslink CD40-Ig in solution</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">G28-5 sFv was a more potent agonist than G28-5 IgG and was able to stimulate CD40 responses by B cells and monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">G28-5 IgG partially blocked , whereas G28-5 sFv augmented CD40 responses during stimulation with natural ligand ( gp39-CD8 fusion protein ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the functional activity of ligands built from the binding site of G28-5 is highly dependent upon the size and physical properties of the molecule both in solution and on the cell surfaces</scope> .</sentence>
