<sentence id="0">Renal cell carcinoma-derived gangliosides suppress nuclear factor-kappaB activation in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) is impaired in T cells from patients with renal cell carcinomas ( RCCs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In circulating T cells from a subset of patients with RCCs , the suppression of NFkappaB binding activity is downstream from the stimulus-induced degradation of the cytoplasmic factor IkappaBalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Tumor-derived soluble products from cultured RCC explants inhibit NFkappaB activity in T cells from healthy volunteers , despite a normal level of stimulus-induced IkappaBalpha degradation in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The inhibitory agent has several features characteristic of a ganglioside , including sensitivity to neuraminidase but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> protease</scope> treatment ; hydrophobicity ; and molecular weight less than 3 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Indeed , we detected gangliosides in supernatants from RCC explants and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> from adjacent normal kidney tissue</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Gangliosides prepared from RCC supernatants , as well as the purified bovine gangliosides G(m1) and G(d1a) , suppressed NFkappaB binding activity in T cells and reduced expression of the cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , our findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that tumor-derived gangliosides <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> blunt antitumor immune responses in patients with RCCs</scope></scope> .</sentence>
