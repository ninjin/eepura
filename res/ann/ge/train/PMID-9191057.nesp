<sentence id="0">Relief of cyclin A gene transcriptional inhibition during activation of human primary T lymphocytes via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cyclin A transcription is cell cycle regulated and induced by cell proliferative signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To understand the mechanisms underlined in this regulation in normal human cells , we have analysed in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the Cyclin A locus in primary T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Stimulation of purified T lymphocytes by a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed at CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules gives rise to a long lasting proliferation in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of accessory cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Cyclin A was observed after 4 days of costimulation with anti CD2 + CD28 whereas stimulation by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> effective</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In vivo genomic DMS footprinting revealed upstream of the major transcription initiation sites , the presence of at least three protein binding sites , two of which were constitutively occupied .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">They bind in vitro respectively ATF-1 and NF-Y proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The third site was occupied in quiescent cells or in cells stimulated by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The mitogenic combination of anti CD2 + anti CD28 released the footprint as cells were committed to proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Consistent with theses results , nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent cells formed a specific complex with this element , whereas extracts prepared from cells treated with anti CD2 + anti CD28 <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">failed</cue> to do so after cells entered a proliferative state</scope> .</sentence>
