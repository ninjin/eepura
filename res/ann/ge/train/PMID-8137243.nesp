<sentence id="0">Hypoxia causes the activation of nuclear factor kappa B through the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha on tyrosine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The response of mammalian cells to stress is controlled by transcriptional regulatory proteins such as nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) to induce a wide variety of early response genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this report , we show that exposure of cells to hypoxia ( 0.02 % O2 ) results in I kappa B alpha degradation , increased NF-kappa B DNA binding activity , and transactivation of a reporter gene construct containing two NF-kappa B DNA binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pretreatment of cells with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the dominant negative allele of c-Raf-1 ( Raf 301 ) inhibited I kappa B alpha degradation , NF-kappa B binding , and transactivation of kappa B reporter constructs by hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To demonstrate a direct link between changes in the phosphorylation pattern of I kappa B alpha with NF-kappa B activation , we immunoprecipitated I kappa B alpha after varying times of hypoxic exposure and found that its tyrosine phosphorylation status increased during hypoxic exposure .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Inhibition of the transfer of tyrosine phosphoryl groups onto I kappa B alpha prevented I kappa B alpha degradation and NF-kappa B binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In comparison to other activators of NF-kappa B such as phorbol myristate acetate or tumor necrosis factor , we did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detect changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of I kappa B alpha following treatment with either of these agents</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that tyrosine phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha during hypoxia is an important proximal step which precedes its dissociation and degradation from NF-kappa B.</scope></sentence>
