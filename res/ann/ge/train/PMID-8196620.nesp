<sentence id="0">Lipopolysaccharide induction of tissue factor gene expression in monocytic cells is mediated by binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a kappa B-like site .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Exposure of monocytic cells to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activates the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins and leads to the rapid induction of inflammatory gene products , including tissue factor ( TF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">TF is the primary cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascades .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report the characterization of a nuclear complex from human monocytic cells that bound to a kappa B-like site , 5'-CGGAGTTTCC-3 ' , in the 5'-flanking region of the human TF gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This nuclear complex was activated by LPS with kinetics that preceded induction of the TF gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the TF site bound translated c-Rel and p65 homodimers but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> p50/p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Base-pair substitutions in the TF site <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> the presence of a cytosine at position 1 precluded binding of NF-kappa B. In fact , under low-ionic-strength conditions , the TF complex did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> migrate with translated p50/p65 dimers</scope> but instead comigrated with c-Rel/p65 dimers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Antibodies against the NF-kappa B and Rel proteins and UV cross-linking studies revealed the presence of c-Rel and p65 and the <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of p50 in the TF complex</scope> and further showed that c-Rel/p65 heterodimers selectively bound to the TF kappa B-like site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Functional studies <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicated that</cue> the TF site conferred LPS inducibility on a heterologous promoter and was transactivated by c-Rel or p65</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , our results demonstrated that binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a novel kappa B-like site mediated LPS induction of TF gene expression in monocytic cells .</sentence>
