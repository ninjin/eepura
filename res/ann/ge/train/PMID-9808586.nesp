<sentence id="0">Interaction of sickle erythrocytes with endothelial cells in the presence of endothelial cell conditioned medium induces oxidant stress leading to transendothelial migration of monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The abnormal adherence of sickle red blood cells ( SS RBC ) to endothelial cells has been <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to contribute to vascular occlusion , a major cause of morbidity in sickle cell disease ( SCD )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We determined <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the interaction of SS RBC with cultured endothelial cells induced cellular oxidant stress that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">would</cue> culminate in expression of cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) involved in the adhesion and diapedesis of monocytes and the adherence of SS reticulocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We showed that the interaction of SS RBC at 2 % concentration in the presence of multimers of von Willebrand factor ( vWf ) , derived from endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium ( E-CM ) with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , resulted in a fivefold increased formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) and activation of the transcription factor NF-kB , both indicators of cellular oxidant stress .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Normal RBC show <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">none</cue> of these phenomena</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The oxidant stress-induced signaling resulted in an increased surface expression of a subset of CAMs , ICAM-1 , E-selectin , and VCAM-1 in HUVEC .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The addition of oxygen radical scavenger enzymes ( catalase , superoxide dismutase ) and antioxidant ( probucol ) inhibited these events .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Additionally , preincubation of HUVEC with a synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp ( RGD ) that prevents vWf-mediated adhesion of SS RBC reduced the surface expression of VCAM-1 and NF-kB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , SS RBC-induced oxidant stress resulted in a twofold increase in the transendothelial migration of both monocyte-like HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes , and approximately a sixfold increase in platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1 ) phosphorylation , each of which was blocked by protein kinase C inhibitor and antioxidants .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the adherence/contact of SS RBC to endothelial cells in large vessel can generate enhanced oxidant stress leading to increased adhesion and diapedesis of monocytes , as well as heightened adherence of SS reticulocytes , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicating that</cue> injury/activation of endothelium can contribute to vaso-occlusion in SCD</scope></scope> .</sentence>
