<sentence id="0">Retinoic acid downmodulates erythroid differentiation and GATA1 expression in purified adult-progenitor culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">All-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) is an important morphogen in vertebrate development , a normal constituent in human adult blood and is also involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have examined the effects of RA on normal hematopoiesis by using early hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) stringently purified from adult peripheral blood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In clonogenetic fetal calf serum-supplemented ( FCS+ ) or -nonsupplemented (FCS-) culture treated with saturating levels of interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and erythropoietin ( Ep ) ( combined with c-kit ligand in FCS(-)-culture conditions ) , RA induces a dramatic dose-dependent shift from erythroid to granulomonocytic colony formation , the latter colonies being essentially represented by granulocytic clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="1"> <scope type="neg" id="0">This shift is <cue type="spec" id="1">apparently</cue> <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> caused by a recruitment phenomenon</scope></scope> , because in FCS+ culture , the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In FCS- liquid-suspension culture supplemented with saturating Ep level and low-dose IL-3/GM-CSF , adult HPC undergo unilineage erythropoietic differentiation : Here again , treatment with high-dose RA induces a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Studies on RA time-response or pulse treatment in semisolid or liquid culture show that early RA addition is most effective , thus <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> early but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> late</scope> HPC are sensitive to its action</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We then analyzed the expression of the master GATA1 gene , which encodes a finger transcription factor required for normal erythroid development ; addition of RA to HPC stimulated into unilineage erythropoietic differentiation in liquid culture caused a virtually complete inhibition of GATA1 mRNA induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> RA directly inhibits the erythroid differentiation program at the level of early adult HPC , and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> lead to a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This phenomenon is correlated with inhibition of GATA1 induction in the early stages of erythropoietic differentiation .</sentence>
