<sentence id="0">Regulation of low shear flow-induced HAEC VCAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We recently reported that prolonged exposure of human aortic endothelial cells ( HAEC ) to low shear stress flow patterns is associated with a sustained increase in the activated form of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we investigate the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesis</cue> that low shear-induced activation of NF-kappaB is responsible for enhanced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM-1 ) resulting in augmented endothelial cell-monocyte ( EC-Mn ) adhesion and that this activation is dependent on intracellular oxidant activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Before exposure to low shear ( 2 dyn/cm2 ) for 6 h , HAEC were preincubated with or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PDTC strongly inhibited low shear-induced activation of NF-kappaB , expression of VCAM-1 , and EC-Mn adhesion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Paradoxically , NAC exerted a positive effect on low shear-induced VCAM-1 expression and EC-Mn adhesion and only slightly downregulated NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activation and VCAM-1 expression are blocked by both PDTC and NAC .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that NF-kappaB plays a key role in low shear-induced VCAM-1 expression and that <scope type="spec" id="3"> pathways mediating low shear- and cytokine-induced EC-Mn adhesion <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be differentially regulated</scope></scope> .</sentence>
