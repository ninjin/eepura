<sentence id="0">IL-10 Production by Th2 and Th17 Cells Also Requires ERK1 and ERK2 Activation</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To address <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> IL-10 production by Th2 and Th17 cells was also dependent on ERK1 and ERK2 activation</scope> , we differentiated these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of APCs</scope> ( Shoemaker et====al. , 2006 ; Veldhoen et====al. , 2009 ; Veldhoen et====al. , 2006 ) , in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of the MEK inhibitor ( PD184352 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We showed that ERK1 and ERK2 activation is a common pathway required for induction of IL-10 in different Th cell subsets because IL-10 production by both Th2 and Th17 cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of the MEK inhibitor ( PD184352 ) ( Figure====5D and Figure====S5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast , inhibitors of p38 MAPK or of GSK-3==beta = = activation did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affect the expression of IL-10 by these subsets ( Figure====S5B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 signaling pathway is therefore a common requirement for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 , Th2 , and Th17 cells .</sentence>
