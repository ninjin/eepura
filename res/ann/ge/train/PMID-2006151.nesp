<sentence id="0">Comparison of constitutive and inducible transcriptional enhancement mediated by kappa B-related sequences : modulation of activity in B cells by human T-cell leukemia virus type I tax gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The kappa B sequence ( GGGACTTTCC ) binds a factor , NF-kappa B , that is constitutively found in its functional , DNA binding form only in B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A factor with apparently indistinguishable sequence specificity can be induced in many other cell types , where it is used to regulate inducible gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For example , kappa B-related sequences have been shown to be important for the transcription of a few inducible genes , such as the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain gene and the beta-interferon gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , these genes are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> constitutively active in B lymphocytes</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that other regulatory mechanisms must play a role in determining the patterns of expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have investigated the constitutive and inducible transcriptional activity mediated by five kappa B-related sequence elements in two different cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that in S194 plasma cells the activity of each element correlates well with the relative affinity of B-cell-derived NF-kappa B for that element .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This leads to significantly lower transcription enhancement by sites derived from the interleukin 2 receptor or T-cell receptor genes in S194 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , in either EL-4 ( T ) cells or S194 cells , both lower-affinity sites can be significantly induced by the tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I , showing that NF-kappa B activity can be modulated even in a B-cell line that constitutively expresses this factor .</sentence>
