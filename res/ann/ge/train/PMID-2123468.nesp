<sentence id="0">Single cell assay of a transcription factor reveals a threshold in transcription activated by signals emanating from the T-cell antigen receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Stimulation of T lymphocytes through their antigen receptor leads to the appearance of several transcription factors , including NF-AT and NF-kappa B , which are involved in regulating genes required for immunologic activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the activity of a single transcription factor in individual viable cells , we have applied an assay that uses the fluorescence-activated cell sorter to quantitate beta-galactosidase ( beta-gal ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have analyzed the distribution of NF-AT transcriptional activity among T cells undergoing activation by using a construct in which three tandem copies of the NF-AT-binding site directs transcription of the lacZ gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Unexpectedly , stimulation of cloned stably transfected Jurkat T cells leads to a bimodal pattern of beta-gal expression in which some cells express <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> beta-gal</scope> and others express high levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This expression pattern cannot be accounted for by cell-cycle position or heritable variation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Further results , in which beta-gal activity is correlated with NF-AT-binding activity , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the concentration of NF-AT must exceed a critical threshold before transcription initiates</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This threshold <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> reflects the NF-AT concentration-dependent assembly of transcription complexes at the promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Similar constructs controlled by NF-kappa B or the entire interleukin-2 enhancer show bimodal expression patterns during induction , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that thresholds set by the concentration of transcription factors <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a common property of inducible genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
