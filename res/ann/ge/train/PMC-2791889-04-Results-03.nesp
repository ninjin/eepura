<sentence id="0">High Antigen Doses and STAT4 Are Required for the In Vivo Generation of IL-10-Producing Th1 Cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells in====vivo , we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> added lipopolysacharide ( LPS )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">T====cells were recovered from the inguinal lymph nodes 3 days after priming and restimulated in====vitro with OVA peptide for 48 hr .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This in====vivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-==gamma = = production , and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization ( Figure====3A ) and with higher doses of OVA ( 3 = = mu==M versus 1 = = mu==M , data <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in====vivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells , we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In vivo expression of both IL-10 and IFN-==gamma = = was markedly reduced but not completely abrogated in the absence of STAT4 signaling ( Figures 3B and 3C ) , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> the existence of compensatory mechanisms that were absent in the in====vitro system</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Signaling through STAT6 had <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> effect on IL-10 production by Th1 cells</scope> as shown by intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) and by immunoassay in STAT6-deficient T====cells ( Figures 3B and 3C ) .</sentence>
