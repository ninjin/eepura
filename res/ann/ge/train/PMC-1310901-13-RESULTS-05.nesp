<sentence id="0">In vitro methylation of an IRF-4 promoter-reporter construct decreases its activity</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To provide evidence for a direct effect of methylational status on IRF-4 promoter activity we performed reporter gene assays with IRF-4 promoter constructs before and after their in vitro methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases ( Figure 5A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Intriguingly , methylation of the IRF-4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells by 85.0 % ( Figure 5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The silencing effect of CpG methylation was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> restricted to IRF-4-positive cells</scope> , since in vitro methylation led to a 92.9 % abrogation of promoter activity in IRF-4-negative Jurkat cells ( Figure 5C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , control methylation of a reporter construct with a different promoter ( FasL ) as well as an empty vector had <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on the reporter activity</scope> <scope type="neg" id="2">( data <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data proved a direct association between methylation and activity of the IRF-4 promoter .</sentence>
