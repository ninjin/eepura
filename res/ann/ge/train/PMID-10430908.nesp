<sentence id="0">NF-kappaB-mediated up-regulation of Bcl-x and Bfl-1/A1 is required for CD40 survival signaling in B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of CD40 is essential for thymus-dependent humoral immune responses and rescuing B cells from apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Many of the effects of CD40 are <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be achieved through altered gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition to Bcl-x , a known CD40-regulated antiapoptotic molecule , we identified a related antiapoptotic molecule , A1/Bfl-1 , as a CD40-inducible gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway by overexpression of a dominant-active inhibitor of NF-kappaB abolished CD40-induced up-regulation of both the Bfl-1 and Bcl-x genes and also eliminated the ability of CD40 to rescue Fas-induced cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Within the upstream promoter region of Bcl-x , a potential NF-kappaB-binding sequence was found to support NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , expression of physiological levels of Bcl-x protected B cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of NF-kappaB signaling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that CD40-mediated cell survival proceeds through NF-kappaB-dependent up-regulation of Bcl-2 family members</scope> .</sentence>
