<sentence id="0">An in vitro globin gene switching model based on differentiated embryonic stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We used mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells to study globin gene expression and switching in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show that ES-derived embryoid bodies express the full complement of mouse embryonic globin genes in the correct temporal order and that on further differentiation , a switch occurs to the fetal/adult genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , the erythroid-specific transcription factor NF-E1 was shown to be expressed coordinately with that of globin in embryoid bodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We conclude from these experiments that the ES cell system provides a good model to study hematopoietic development .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When the human epsilon- or beta-globin genes driven by the dominant control region ( DCR ) are introduced into this system , <scope type="neg" id="0">the human epsilon-globin gene , in contrast to the beta-globin gene , is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> deregulated by the presence of the DCR</scope> and is expressed strictly as an embryonic gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We conclude from this that <scope type="neg" id="1">the epsilon-globin gene is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> regulated by competition with other genes in the human beta-globin locus</scope> .</sentence>
