<sentence id="0">Functional analysis of cis-linked regulatory sequences in the HLA DRA promoter by transcription in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Two consensus sequences , called X and Y boxes , capable of binding nuclear proteins and regulating expression in B cells have been defined within the immediate upstream region of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Unlike other class II promoters , the HLA-DR alpha ( DRA ) promoter also contains one element identical to the " octamer " motif of immunoglobulin variable region promoters that is responsible for B cell-specific transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This " octamer " in the context of DRA appears capable of binding both the ubiquitous ( OTF-1 ) and lymphoid-specific ( OTF-2 ) " octamer " binding proteins , but at least one other distinct " octamer " complex was found .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In order to characterize the function of cis-acting elements , we have developed an in vitro system in which a DRA promoter construct is transcribed more efficiently in extracts from B cells than in extracts from class II-negative HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">5' deletion constructs which <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacked</cue> the Y box</scope> , but retained the " octamer " motif and TATA box were completely inactive , and internal deletion of the Y box reduced transcription by 95 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using supercoiled , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> linear templates</scope> , we observed differences in transcription efficiencies from templates <scope type="spec" id="3"> <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacking</cue> <cue type="spec" id="3">or</cue> disrupting the X consensus element</scope> that reflect effects of random replacement of X box sequences in transient expression assays</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Demonstration of the complete dependence on the Y box in this system <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that , despite its demonstrated importance in the DRA promoter , the DRA " octamer " does <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> utilize OTF-2 in a manner analogous to immunoglobulin promoters in B cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
