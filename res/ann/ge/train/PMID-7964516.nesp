<sentence id="0">Functional Myc-Max heterodimer is required for activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T cell hybridomas respond to activation signals by undergoing apoptotic cell death , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> this is <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> to represent comparable events related to tolerance induction in immature and mature T cells in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies using antisense oligonucleotides implicated the c-Myc protein in the phenomenon of activation-induced apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This role for c-Myc in apoptosis is now confirmed in studies using a dominant negative form of its heterodimeric binding partner , Max , which we show here inhibits activation-induced apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Further , coexpression of a reciprocally mutant Myc protein capable of forming functional heterodimers with the mutant Max can compensate for the dominant negative activity and restore activation-induced apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">imply</cue> that Myc promotes activation-induced apoptosis by obligatory heterodimerization with Max , and therefore , by regulating gene transcription</scope> .</sentence>
