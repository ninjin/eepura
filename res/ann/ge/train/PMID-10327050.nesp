<sentence id="0">Cell growth-regulated expression of mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes mediated by the transcription factor E2F .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Initiation of DNA replication requires the function of MCM gene products , which participate in ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once in the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Expression of all mammalian genes of the MCM family is induced by growth stimulation , unlike yeast , and the mRNA levels peak at G1/S boundary .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we examined the transcriptional activities of isolated human MCM gene promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Human MCM5 and MCM6 promoters with mutation in the E2F sites <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> in promoter regulation following serum stimulation and exogenous E2F expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , we identified a novel E2F-like sequence in human MCM6 promoter which cooperates with the authentic E2F sites in E2F-dependent regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Forced expression of E2F1 could induce expression of all members of the endogenous MCM genes in rat embryonal fibroblast REF52 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results demonstrated that the growth-regulated expression of mammalian MCM5 and MCM6 genes , and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">presumably</cue> other MCM members</scope> , is primarily regulated by E2F through binding to multiple E2F sites in the promoters .</sentence>
