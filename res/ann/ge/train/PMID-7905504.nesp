<sentence id="0">Effects of CD45 on NF-kappa B. Implications for replication of HIV-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Increased levels of replication of the HIV type 1 are observed after the activation of infected T cells through the TCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , anti-CD45 antibodies inhibit these effects in cells from infected individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we examined interrelationships between CD45 and HIV-1 further .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We measured effects on the HIV-1 LTR in T cell lines that were stimulated with antibodies against CD45 and in those that <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacked</cue> the expression of CD45 on their surfaces</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">First , anti-CD45 antibodies did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect basal</scope> but decreased activated levels of expression from the HIV-1 LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Second , T cells , which <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> CD45 and cannot signal via the TCR</scope> , supported higher levels of viral replication and gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This was due to the presence of active NF-kappa B complexes in the nucleus of CD45- T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Additionally , infected T cells displayed lower levels of CD45 on their surfaces .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , CD45 plays an active role in the physiology of T cells and in the replication of HIV-1 .</sentence>
