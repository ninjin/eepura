<sentence id="0">Immunosuppression by glucocorticoids : inhibition of NF-kappa B activity through induction of I kappa B synthesis [ see comments ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">They inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function , but <scope type="spec" id="0"> the mechanism underlying this activity has been <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation in mice and cultured cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This inhibition is mediated by induction of the I kappa B alpha inhibitory protein , which traps activated NF-kappa B in inactive cytoplasmic complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Because NF-kappa B activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli , the inhibition of its activity <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">can</cue> be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids</scope> .</sentence>
