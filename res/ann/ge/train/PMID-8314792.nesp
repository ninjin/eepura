<sentence id="0">Comparative analysis of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) complex in human T and B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) is a transcriptional activator that binds to sequences in the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter and <scope type="spec" id="0"> is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be largely responsible for the T cell-specific inducibility of IL-2 expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that <scope type="spec" id="1"> specific NFAT binding activity <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> also be induced in human B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The B cell NFAT complex , however , was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> functional</scope> , since it <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">failed</cue> to activate transcription from an NFAT-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) construct</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Competition with an AP-1 motif or with anti-Jun and anti-Fos antibodies abolished binding to the NFAT motif in both T and B cells , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> Jun and Fos are critical for NFAT complex formation in both cell types</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Purified recombinant Jun and Fos proteins failed to bind directly to the NFAT motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , when combined with unstimulated B or T cell extracts , full-length , but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> truncated</scope> , Jun/Fos heterodimers were able to form an NFAT complex , indicating the presence of a constitutively expressed nuclear factor(s) in B and T cells necessary for the formation of the NFAT complex in both cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">An NFAT oligonucleotide carrying mutations in the 5' purine-rich part of the NFAT sequence <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">failed</cue> to form a complex and to compete with the wild type motif for NFAT complex formation in both T and B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We therefore <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">propose</cue> a model whereby a core NFAT complex consisting of Jun , Fos , and a constitutive nuclear factor is formed in both T and B cells</scope> , but <scope type="spec" id="9"> <scope type="spec" id="8"> an additional factor <cue type="spec" id="8">and/or</cue> post-translational modification of a factor , missing in B cells</scope> , <cue type="spec" id="9">might</cue> be required for transactivation by NFAT</scope> .</sentence>
