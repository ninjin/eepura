<sentence id="0">T cell priming enhances IL-4 gene expression by increasing nuclear factor of activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The repetitive activation of T cells ( priming ) enhances the expression of many cytokines , such as IL-4 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> others , such as IL-2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Molecular mechanisms underlying selective expression of cytokines by T cells remain poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that priming of CD4 T cells selectively enhances IL-4 expression relative to IL-2 expression by a transcriptional mechanism involving nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As detected by in vivo footprinting , priming markedly increases the activation-dependent engagement of the P0 and P1 NFAT-binding elements of the IL-4 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , each proximal P element is essential for optimal IL-4 promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Activated primed CD4 T cells contain more NFAT1 and support greater NFAT-directed transcription than unprimed CD4 T cells , while activator protein 1 binding and activator protein 1-mediated transcription by both cell types is similar .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Increased expression of wild-type NFAT1 substantially increases IL-4 promoter activity in unprimed CD4 T cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> NFAT1 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be limiting for IL-4 gene expression in this cell type</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , a truncated form of NFAT1 acts as a dominant-negative , reducing IL-4 promoter activity in primed CD4 T cells and confirming the importance of endogenous NFAT to increased IL-4 gene expression by effector T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="3"> NFAT1 <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to be the major NFAT family member responsible for the initial increased expression of IL-4 by primed CD4 T cells</scope> .</sentence>
