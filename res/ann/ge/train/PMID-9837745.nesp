<sentence id="0">Interleukin-12 expression in B cells by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although interleukin (IL)-12 was originally purified from an Epstein-Barr (EBV)-transformed B cell line and the high correlation of EBV infection and IL-12 expression has been <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> study has reported <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> EBV infection is directly linked to IL-12 expression</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To address this issue , we have investigated IL-12 expression in B cells during in vitro transformation with EBV .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Human peripheral B cells became capable of constitutively producing p40 by in vitro transformation with EBV , coincident with the expression of latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) of EBV .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These B cells expressed p40 and p35 mRNA , and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) stimulation strongly enhanced p40 and p70 production .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , transfection with LMP1 expression vector into a human B lymphoma cell line , Daudi , led to p40 production with nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that transformation of primary B cells with EBV induces IL-12 expression <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">potentially</cue> through LMP1 expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
