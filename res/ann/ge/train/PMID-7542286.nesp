<sentence id="0">Nitric oxide decreases cytokine-induced endothelial activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nitric oxide selectively reduces endothelial expression of adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To test the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesis</cue> that nitric oxide ( NO ) limits endothelial activation</scope> , we treated cytokine-stimulated human saphenous vein endothelial cells with several NO donors and assessed their effects on the inducible expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In a concentration-dependent manner , NO inhibited interleukin (IL)-1 alpha-stimulated VCAM-1 expression by 35-55 % as determined by cell surface enzyme immunoassays and flow cytometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This inhibition was paralleled by reduced monocyte adhesion to endothelial monolayers in nonstatic assays , was unaffected by cGMP analogues , and was quantitatively similar after stimulation by either IL-1 alpha , IL-1 beta , IL-4 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF alpha ) , or bacterial lipopolysaccharide .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NO also decreased the endothelial expression of other leukocyte adhesion molecules ( E-selectin and to a lesser extent , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ) and secretable cytokines ( IL-6 and IL-8 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inhibition of endogenous NO production by L-N-monomethyl-arginine also induced the expression of VCAM-1 , but did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> augment cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Nuclear run-on assays , transfection studies using various VCAM-1 promoter reporter gene constructs , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> NO represses VCAM-1 gene transcription , in part , by inhibiting NF-kappa B. We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that NO 's ability to limit endothelial activation and inhibit monocyte adhesion <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> contribute to some of its antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory properties within the vessel wall</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
