<sentence id="0">Amelioration of rat cerulein pancreatitis by guamerin-derived peptide , a novel elastase inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Increased activity of various proteases is observed in both human and experimental pancreatitis ; however , the information on the effects of specific protease inhibitors on the disease is limited .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study we show that a novel elastase inhibitor , guamerin-derived synthetic peptide ( GDSP ) , improves the parameters of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The effects of GDSP on pancreatic weight , serum amylase and lipase , morphologic changes in the pancreas , neutrophil infiltration , and nuclear factor KB ( NF-KB ) activation were measured in rats infused with supramaximal dose of cerulein ( 5 ( g/kg/h ) for 6 h. The effects of GDSP were also measured on superoxide formation by activated human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The effects of GDSP were compared with those of another elastase inhibitor , elastatinal .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">GDSP significantly inhibited edema formation , neutrophil infiltration , acinar cell damage , and plasma lipase and amylase increases caused by cerulein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">GDSP also completely inhibited superoxide formation in the human neutrophils stimulated by N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenyl-alanine ( fMLP ) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Elastatinal had some of the same effects as GDSP but was less potent and effective .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of GDSP , a novel specific elastase inhibitor , on the development of rat cerulein pancreatitis .</sentence>
