<sentence id="0">Possible role of nuclear factor-kappa B activity in germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) plays a broad role in gene regulation , but it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">not evident</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> NF-kappa B acts as a messenger system for germline C epsilon transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report here that the signaling cascade triggered by interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) participates in NF-kappa B activation responsible for germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line , DND39 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-kinase ) , translocation of a zeta isoform of protein kinase C , and nuclear expression of NF-kappa B. All such events were abrogated by treatment with LY294002 , a specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent antioxidant , decreased NF-kappa B activation caused by <scope type="spec" id="2"> IL-4 , anti-CD40 mAb , <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> their combination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NAC was also effective in diminishing germline C epsilon transcription , and its potency was higher in cultures costimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb than in those stimulated with IL-4 alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> IL-4 and ligation of CD40 induce NF-kappa B expression via at least a mechanism dependent on the PI3-kinase pathway</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that NF-kappa B sensitive to NAC <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> play a role in regulating germline C epsilon transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
