<sentence id="0">Cross-linking of CD44 on rheumatoid synovial cells up-regulates VCAM-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD44 is a ubiquitous molecule also known as hyaluronic acid or homing receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the cellular functions and its role in inflammation , for example , rheumatoid synovitis , are currently <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we propose a novel function for CD44 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using synovial cells from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , we demonstrated that CD44 cross-linking and binding to hyaluronan augmented VCAM-1 expression and subsequently VCAM-1-mediated cell adhesion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Briefly , we found that 1 ) rheumatoid synovial cells highly expressed CD44 ; 2 ) cross-linking of CD44 markedly but transiently augmented VCAM-1 expression and its mRNA transcription much more than did IL-1beta and TNF-alpha ; 3 ) hyaluronan , especially when fragmented , also up-regulated VCAM-1 ; 4 ) CD44 activated the transcription factor AP-1 ; and 5 ) the integrin-dependent adhesive function of RA synovial cells to T cells was also amplified by CD44 cross-linking .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the adhesion of RA synovial cells to matrices such as hyaluronic acid through CD44 could up-regulate VCAM-1 expression and VCAM-1-mediated adhesion to T cells , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> in turn cause activation of T cells and synovial cells in RA synovitis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We therefore <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that such cross-talking among distinct adhesion molecules <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation , including RA synovitis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
