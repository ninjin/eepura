<sentence id="0">Expression and genomic configuration of GM-CSF , IL-3 , M-CSF receptor ( C-FMS ) , early growth response gene-1 ( EGR-1 ) and M-CSF genes in primary myelodysplastic syndromes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seventeen patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) in advanced stage were enriched for blasts and tested for ( 1 ) karyotype , ( 2 ) genomic configuration and ( 3 ) expression of IL-3 , GM-CSF , FMS and EGR-1 genes which are all located on the long arm of chromosome 5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The expression of the M-CSF gene , that has been recently reassigned to the short arm of chromosome 1 ( lp ) , was also investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Aims of the study were to ( 1 ) assess the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> role of the expression of these genes in the maintenance and expansion of the neoplastic clones</scope> and ( 2 ) search for constitutional losses or rearrangements of one allele followed by a deletion of the second allele of the same genes in the leukemic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The latter issue was investigated by comparing , in 8 cases , constitutive DNA from skin fibroblasts with leukemic DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Eleven of the 17 patients had abnormal karyotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The M-CSF gene was expressed in 6 cases and the FMS and the EGR-1 genes were expressed in 2 of the latter cases .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="1"> An autocrine mechanism of growth could be <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesized</cue> only for the 2 patients whose cells expressed both the M-CSF and FMS genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">No</cue> germline changes or rearrangements were observed in any of the genes studied</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <scope type="neg" id="3">deregulation of genes encoding for certain hemopoietic growth factors or receptors does <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="4">seem</cue> to represent a major mechanism of MDS progression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
