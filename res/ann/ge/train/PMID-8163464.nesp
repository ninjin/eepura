<sentence id="0">A novel heterodimerization partner for thyroid hormone receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Retinoid-like receptors play a central role in hormonal responses by forming heterodimers with other nuclear hormone receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) as a new thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein , heterodimerizing with THR in solution .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although these heterodimers do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR+4 )</scope> , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE ( DR+2 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The critical region of THR beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Hence , PPAR can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on TRE structure and THR isotype .</sentence>
