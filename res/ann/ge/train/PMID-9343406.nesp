<sentence id="0">Blockade of T-cell activation by dithiocarbamates involves novel mechanisms of inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Dithiocarbamates ( DTCs ) have recently been reported as powerful inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation in a number of cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Given the role of this transcription factor in the regulation of gene expression in the inflammatory response , <scope type="spec" id="0"> NF-kappaB inhibitors have been <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> as <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> therapeutic drugs for inflammatory diseases</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show here that DTCs inhibited both interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) synthesis and membrane expression of antigens which are induced during T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This inhibition , which occurred with a parallel activation of c-Jun transactivating functions and expression , was reflected by transfection experiments at the IL-2 promoter level , and involved not only the inhibition of NF-kappaB-driven reporter activation but also that of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Accordingly , electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> pyrrolidine DTC ( PDTC ) prevented NF-kappaB , and NFAT DNA-binding activity in T cells stimulated with either phorbol myristate acetate plus ionophore or antibodies against the CD3-T-cell receptor complex and simultaneously activated the binding of AP-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , PDTC differentially targeted both NFATp and NFATc family members , inhibiting the transactivation functions of NFATp and mRNA induction of NFATc. Strikingly , Western blotting and immunocytochemical experiments <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> PDTC promoted a transient and rapid shuttling of NFATp and NFATc , leading to their accelerated export from the nucleus of activated T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">propose</cue> that the activation of an NFAT kinase by PDTC <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the NFAT</scope> , therefore transiently converting the sustained transactivation of this transcription factor that occurs during lymphocyte activation</scope> , and show that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) can act by directly phosphorylating NFATp .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , the combined inhibitory effects on NFAT and NF-KB support a <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">potential</cue> use of DTCs as immunosuppressants</scope> .</sentence>
