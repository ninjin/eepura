<sentence id="0">Molecular cloning and functional characterization of murine cDNA encoding transcription factor NFATc.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factors of the NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) family play important roles in immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the expression of genes encoding cytokines and immunoregulatory proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we describe cloning and characterization of full-length cDNA encoding murine ( m ) NFATc which predicts that the protein has all the conserved structural motifs of NFAT family members , including the rel homology domain , the NFAT homology domain and the nuclear translocation signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">mNFATc complexed with AP-1 bound specifically to the murine IL-2 NFAT recognition sequence and activated transcription from the co-transfected IL-2 promoter in COS-7 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Northern blot analysis showed that the cDNA probe hybridized with a 4.5 kb transcript which is highly inducible in murine T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By Northern and in situ hybridization , mNFATc transcript was detected from the early stage of development .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the mouse embryo , mNFATc transcript was strongly expressed in thymus , lung and submandibular gland and weakly in skeletal muscle and heart <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that mNFATc <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> have a role both in embryogenesis and in mature T cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
