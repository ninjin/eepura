<sentence id="0">Stimulation of a human T-cell clone with anti-CD3 or tumor necrosis factor induces NF-kappa B translocation but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> human immunodeficiency virus 1 enhancer-dependent transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The expression of transiently transfected expression vectors under the control of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) or its enhancer sequence and the translocation of the HIV enhancer-binding protein NF-kappa B were analyzed in two human T-cell clones stimulated through their T-cell receptor complex or by tumor necrosis factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found a dissociation of NF-kappa B translocation from transactivation of either the HIV LTR or the HIV enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Interleukin 2 induced proliferation but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> NF-kappa B translocation or LTR transactivation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Phorbol ester or specific antigen recognition induced HIV LTR transactivation , whereas stimulation with tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The two latter signals were nevertheless able to induce NF-kappa B translocation with a pattern in the band-shift assay indistinguishable from that observed using phorbol ester .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our finding that induction of NF-kappa B by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to CD3 is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> sufficient to induce HIV enhancer-dependent transcription in cloned T cells</scope> contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid T-cell lines and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicates that</cue> normal T lymphocytes differ from tumoral T cells in terms of requirements for HIV LTR activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , our results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that events linked to T-cell activation , in addition to NF-kappa B translocation per se , induce functional interactions of the NF-kappa B complex with the HIV enhancer</scope> .</sentence>
