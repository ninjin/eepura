<sentence id="0">Tandem AP-1-binding sites within the human beta-globin dominant control region function as an inducible enhancer in erythroid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A powerful enhancer has been mapped to an 18-bp DNA segment located 11 kb 5' to the human epsilon-globin gene within the dominant control or locus-activating region .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This enhancer is inducible in K562 human erythroleukemia cells , increasing linked gamma-globin promoter/luciferase gene expression to 170-fold over an enhancerless construct .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The enhancer consists of tandem AP-1-binding sites , phased 10 bp apart , which are both required for full activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DNA-protein binding assays with nuclear extracts from induced cells demonstrate a high molecular weight complex on the enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The formation of this complex also requires both AP-1 sites and correlates with maximal enhancer activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Induction of the enhancer <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> have a role in the increase in globin gene transcription that characterizes erythroid maturation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Enhancer activity <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to be mediated by the binding of a complex of proteins from the jun and fos families to tandem AP-1 consensus sequences</scope> .</sentence>
