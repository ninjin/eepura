<sentence id="0">Characterization of defensin resistance phenotypes associated with mutations in the phoP virulence regulon of Salmonella typhimurium .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The defensin sensitivities of Salmonella typhimurium strains with mutations in the phoP/phoQ two-component virulence regulon were tested by using purified defensins NP-1 and NP-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Strains with mutations in either gene of the regulatory pair ( phoP [ transcriptional activator ] or phoQ [ membrane sensor kinase ] ) had increased sensitivities to defensin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The predicted periplasmic domain of the PhoQ protein contained a markedly anionic domain that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> interact with cationic proteins</scope> and that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> be responsible for resistance to defensin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Because insertion mutations in phoP are polar on phoQ , we constructed strains that expressed the PhoQ protein in the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of PhoP</scope> to test <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> resistance to defensin requires only the phoQ gene product</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system , because strains expressing PhoQ <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> PhoP</scope> were still markedly sensitive to defensins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">implied</cue> that a pag ( phoP-activated gene ) product is responsible for defensin resistance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also tested for the ability of defensins NP-1 , NP-5 , and HNP-1 to activate pag expression and found that these peptides have <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the PhoP-PhoQ regulon because mutations in pagC , as well as ones in the phoP locus that resulted in constitutive pag activation ( phenotype PhoPc ) , had <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">no</cue> effect on defensin resistance</scope> , even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The virulence defect conferred by mutations in the phoP-phoQ two-component regulatory system is not completely explained by alterations in resistance to cationic proteins and involves the control of other proteins necessary for S. typhimurium survival within macrophages .</sentence>
