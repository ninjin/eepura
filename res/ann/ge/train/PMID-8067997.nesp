<sentence id="0">Inhibition of activation of transcription factor AP-1 by CD28 signalling in human T-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Co-stimulation of T-lymphocytes by T-cell receptor ( TcR ) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) production .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The increase in IL-2 gene expression triggered by CD28 involves a kappa B-like sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the IL-2 promoter , called CD28-responsive element .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Stimulation of T-cells by agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- or TcR-derived signals induces the enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Here we report that CD28 engagement , however , exerts opposite effects on the transcription factor AP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Whereas anti-CD28 together with PMA increased the DNA binding and trans-activation activity of NF-kappa B , PMA-induced activation of AP-1 was significantly suppressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The inhibitory effect exerted by anti-CD28 was observed at the level of DNA binding as well as in functional reporter-gene assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the two transcription factors are independently regulated and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> perform different functions during T-cell activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
