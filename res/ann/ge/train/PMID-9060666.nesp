<sentence id="0">Alteration of a single serine in the basic domain of the Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein separates its functions of transcriptional activation and disruption of latency .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The ZEBRA protein from Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) activates a switch from the latent to the lytic expression program of the virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">ZEBRA , a member of the bZIP family of DNA-binding proteins , is a transcriptional activator capable of inducing expression from viral lytic cycle promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It had previously been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> that ZEBRA 's capacity to disrupt EBV latency resided primarily in its ability to activate transcription of genes that encode products required for lytic replication</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We generated a point mutant of ZEBRA , Z(S186A) , <scope type="neg" id="1">that was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> impaired in its ability to activate transcription</scope> ; however , this mutation abolished its ability to initiate the viral lytic cascade .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The mutant , containing a serine-to-alanine substitution in the DNA-binding domain of the protein , bound to several known ZEBRA-binding sites and activated transcription from reporters bearing known ZEBRA-responsive promoters but did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> disrupt latency in EBV-infected cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , initiation of the EBV lytic cycle by the ZEBRA protein requires a function in addition to transcriptional activation ; a change of serine 186 to alanine in the DNA-binding domain of ZEBRA abolished this additional function and uncovered a new role for the ZEBRA protein in disruption of EBV latency .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The additional function that is required for initiation of the lytic viral life cycle is <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> to require phosphorylation of serine 186 of the ZEBRA protein , which <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> influence either DNA recognition or transcriptional activation of lytic viral promoters in a chromatinized viral episome</scope></scope> .</sentence>
