<sentence id="0">Soluble factors secreted by activated T-lymphocytes modulate the transcription of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta 2 in glial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Coordination of the immune response to injury or disease in the brain is postulated to involve bi-directional discourse between the immune system and the central nervous system .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This cross communication involves soluble mediators , including various growth factors , cytokines , and neuropeptides .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this report , we demonstrate that the supernatant from activated T-lymphocytes is able to induce the transcription of a potent cytokine , TGF-beta 2 in glial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The activating stimulus invokes signaling mechanisms distinct from known kinase or protease pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activation of TGF-beta 2 transcription correlates with the loss of binding activity for an 80 kDA glial labile repressor protein , GLRP , to a responsive region within the TFG-beta 2 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although GLRP shares some characteristics with the inducible transcription factor AP-1 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> it <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be distinct from known AP-1 family members</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data along with previous observations demonstrating the potent immunosuppressive activity of TGF-beta 2 , support a model for a feedback mechanism between the activated T-lymphocytes and astrocytes via TGF-beta 2 to regulate the immune response .</sentence>
