<sentence id="0">Regulation of gene expression with double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific transcriptional regulatory proteins is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods , each with specific limitations .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Inhibition of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded ( ds ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or kappa B consensus sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or NF-kappa B-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected B cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">probably</cue> compete for binding of specific transcription factors</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> provide anti-viral , immunosuppressive , or other therapeutic effects</scope> .</sentence>
