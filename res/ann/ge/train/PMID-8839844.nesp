<sentence id="0">E3 , a hematopoietic-specific transcript directly regulated by the retinoic acid receptor alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Retinoic acid (RA)-induced maturation mediated by the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) has been implicated in myeloid development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have used differential hybridization analysis of a cDNA library constructed from the murine RA-inducible MPRO promyelocyte cell line to identify immediate-early genes induced by RA during granulocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">E3 , one of nine sequences identified , was upregulated in an immediate-early manner , with transcript levels peaking after 60 minutes exposure to RA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">E3 transcripts were RA-inducible in HL60 cells , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in an RA-resistant subclone , HL60R , that harbors a mutated RAR alpha gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , when HL60R cells were transduced with a functional copy of the RAR alpha gene , RA induced a 10-fold increase in E3 mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">E3 transcripts are present in the myeloid , B-lymphoid , and erythroid lineages , absent in nonhematopoietic cells , and encode a highly hydrophobic , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potentially</cue> phosphorylated</scope> polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> protein</scope> expressed in myeloid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The murine E3 promoter harbors a single bipartite retinoic acid response element which in transient transfection assays conferred RA sensitivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> E3 is a hematopoietic-specific gene that is an immediate target for the activated RAR alpha during myelopoiesis</scope> .</sentence>
