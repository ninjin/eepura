<sentence id="0">T cells from renal cell carcinoma patients exhibit an abnormal pattern of kappa B-specific DNA-binding activity : a preliminary report .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the poor induction of a T-cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif-specific DNA-binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B-binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The magnitude of kappa B activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to kappa B/Rel family proteins , the kappa B-binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF-kappa B1 ( p50 ) subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The second abnormality in kappa B-binding activity in T cells from these patients is that RelA , a member of the Rel homology family which is part of the normal NF-kappa B complex , was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> induced in the nucleus following activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Western blotting analysis did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The altered kappa B-binding activity in T cells from RCC patients <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli</scope> .</sentence>
