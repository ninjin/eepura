<sentence id="0">Nuclear factor-IL6 activates the human IL-4 promoter in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Positive regulatory element I ( PRE-I ) is a strong enhancer element essential for expression of the human IL-4 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To identify transcription factors binding to PRE-I , we screened a cDNA expression library from Jurkat T cells and isolated a cDNA encoding nuclear factor (NF)-IL6 ( also known as C/EBP beta ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">NF-IL6 mRNA was found in human Jurkat T cells and in the mouse Th2 clone D10 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in Th1 clone 29</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">rNF-IL6 expressed in bacteria was shown to specifically bind to PRE-I .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">PRE-I forms multiple DNA-protein complexes with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Some of these complexes were demonstrated to contain NF-IL6 by using anti-C/EBP beta Abs. Overexpression of NF-IL6 enhanced expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene linked to the PRE-I-thymidine kinase or the human IL-4 promoter more than 10-fold in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Promoter deletion studies revealed two additional NF-IL6 binding sites located at positions -44 to -36 ( C/EBP proximal ) and -87 to -79 ( C/EBP medial ) , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results demonstrate that NF-IL6 is involved in transcriptional activation of the human IL-4 promoter in T cells .</sentence>
