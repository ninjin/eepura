<sentence id="0">Physical interactions between Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins play an important role in their cooperative activation of the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcriptional regulatory elements of many inducible T-cell genes contain adjacent or overlapping binding sites for the Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT families of transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Similar arrays of functionally important NF-kappaB/NFAT and Ets binding sites are present in the transcriptional enhancers of human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 ( HIV-1 and HIV-2 ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that this pattern of nuclear protein binding sites reflects an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating inducible T-cell gene expression that has been co-opted during HIV evolution</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Despite these findings , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the molecular mechanisms by which Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins cooperatively regulate inducible T-cell gene expression remained <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the studies described in this report , we demonstrated a physical interaction between multiple Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins both in vitro and in activated normal human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This interaction is mediated by the Ets domain of Ets proteins and the C-terminal region of the Rel homology domains of NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , the Ets-NF-kappaB/NFAT interaction requires the presence of DNA binding sites for both proteins , as it is abolished by the DNA intercalating agents propidium iodide and ethidium bromide and enhanced by the presence of synthetic oligonucleotides containing binding sites for Ets and NF-kappaB proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A dominant-negative mutant of NF-kappaB p50 that binds DNA but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">fails</cue> to interact with Ets proteins</scope> inhibits the synergistic activation of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers by NF-kappaB ( p50 + p65 ) and Ets-1 , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that physical interaction between Ets and NF-kappaB proteins is required for the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enhancers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that evolutionarily conserved physical interactions between Ets and NF-kappaB/NFAT proteins are important in regulating the inducible expression of T-cell genes and viruses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These interactions represent a <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">potential</cue> target for the development of novel immunosuppressive and antiviral therapies</scope> .</sentence>
