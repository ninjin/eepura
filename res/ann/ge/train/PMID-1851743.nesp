<sentence id="0">Inhibition of protein phosphatases by okadaic acid induces AP1 in human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To examine the role of protein phosphatases in T cell activation , Jurkat cells were treated with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A phosphatases , and nuclear extracts were examined for the presence of AP1 as a measure of early T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Okadaic acid was found to be a potent inducer of AP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast to phorbol esters such as phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , the induction of AP1 by okadaic acid occurs predominantly by transcriptional activation of the jun and fos family of proto-oncogenes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Surprisingly , while the addition of phytohemagglutinin further enhanced the induction of AP1 , the addition of PMA inhibited it .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Okadaic acid treatment was found to dramatically increase mRNA transcripts of the jun family of proto-oncogenes including c-jun , junD , and junB and to a lesser extent the fos family including c-fos and fra-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By comparison , PMA is a very inefficient inducer of the jun gene family in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similar to its effect on the induction of AP1 by okadaic acid , PMA inhibits the induction of c-jun mRNA by okadaic acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Transfection of c-jun promoter constructs confirmed the marked difference between PMA and okadaic acid in inducing c-jun transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The induction of AP1 by okadaic acid <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that protein phosphatases 1 and 2A ( PP1 and PP2A ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be involved in T cell activation as important negative regulators of the transcription factor AP1</scope></scope> .</sentence>
