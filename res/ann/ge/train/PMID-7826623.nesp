<sentence id="0">T-cell functional regions of the human IL-3 proximal promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) gene is expressed almost exclusively in activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Its expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have previously shown that treatment of Jurkat T cells with phytohemaglutinin ( PHA ) and the phorbol ester , PMA , activated transcription initiation from the IL-3 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To define the regions of the gene required for transcription activation , we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different regions of the IL-3 gene 5' and 3' flanking sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both positive and negative regulatory elements were identified in the proximal 5' flanking region of the IL-3 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The promoter region between -173 and -60 contained the strongest activating elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The transcription factor AP-1 could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We also examined the function of the IL-3 CK-1/CK-2 elements that are present in many cytokine genes and found that they acted as a repressor of basal level expression when cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter but were also inducible by PMA/PHA .</sentence>
