<sentence id="0">Absence of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> due to promoter alterations</scope></sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously demonstrated a lack of IRF-4 expression in leukemia patients and specifically in CML T-cells ( 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we demonstrate the absence of IRF-4 expression in various hematopoietic cell lines , such as Jurkat , a T-cell leukemia , CML-T1 , a bcr-abl-positive T-cell line , K-562 , a bcr-abl-positve erythroleukemia , U-937 , a monocytic leukemia , EM-2 and LAMA-84 , bcr-abl-positve myeloid leukemia , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in SD-1</scope> , a bcr-abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( pre B-ALL ) , RPMI-8226 , a multiple myeloma and BV-173 , a bcr-abl-positive B-cell line ( Figures 1A and 5D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">After sequencing of the IRF-4 promoter , it could be excluded that <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of IRF-4 expression in any of the above cell lines</scope> was due to genetic aberrations .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , 2 bp changes ( nucleotide = = -==1081 , T==-->==C and = = -==1068 , A==-->==C ) could be detected in both the IRF-4-positive BV-173 and the IRF-4-negative LAMA-84 , EM-2 and K-562 ( Figure 1B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">At position = = -==116 an A==-->==C substitution was found in EM-2 , K-562 and CML-T1 , whereas Jurkat , BV-173 and SD-1 exhibited a mixed A/C sequence and U-937 , LAMA-84 and RPMI-8226 <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> substitution at all ( Figure 1B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Consequently , these alterations are <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">unlikely</cue> to affect IRF-4 expression</scope> .</sentence>
