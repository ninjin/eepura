<sentence id="0">CTLA-4-Mediated inhibition of early events of T cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CTLA-4 engagement by mAbs inhibits , while CD28 enhances , IL-2 production and proliferation upon T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we have analyzed the mechanisms involved in CTLA-4-mediated inhibition of T cell activation of naive CD4+ T cells using Ab cross-linking .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">CTLA-4 ligation inhibited CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 mRNA accumulation by inhibiting IL-2 transcription , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be mediated in part through decreasing NF-AT accumulation in the nuclei</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <scope type="neg" id="1">CTLA-4 ligation did <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to affect the CD28-mediated stabilization of IL-2 mRNA</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , CTLA-4 engagement inhibited progression through the cell cycle by inhibiting the production of cyclin D3 , cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4 , and cdk6 when the T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 and with anti-CD3 alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> CTLA-4 signaling inhibits events early in T cell activation both at IL-2 transcription and at the level of IL-2-independent events of the cell cycle , and does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> simply oppose CD28-mediated costimulation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
