<sentence id="1">Activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells transcription factor ( NF-AT ) is a key event underlying lymphocyte action .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The CAML ( calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand ) protein is a coinducer of NF-AT activation when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily was isolated by virtue of its affinity for CAML .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Cross-linking of this lymphocyte-specific protein , designated TACI ( transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor ) , on the surface of transfected Jurkat cells with TACI-specific antibodies led to activation of the transcription factors NF-AT , AP-1 , and NFkappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">TACI-induced activation of NF-AT was specifically blocked by a dominant-negative CAML mutant , thus implicating CAML as a signaling intermediate .</sentence>
