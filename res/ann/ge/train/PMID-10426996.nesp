<sentence id="0">Cell activation and apoptosis by bacterial lipoproteins through toll-like receptor-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Apoptosis is implicated in the generation and resolution of inflammation in response to bacterial pathogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">All bacterial pathogens produce lipoproteins ( BLPs ) , which trigger the innate immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">BLPs were found to induce apoptosis in THP-1 monocytic cells through human Toll-like receptor-2 ( hTLR2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">BLPs also initiated apoptosis in an epithelial cell line transfected with hTLR2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , BLPs stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB , a transcriptional activator of multiple host defense genes , and activated the respiratory burst through hTLR2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , hTLR2 is a molecular link between microbial products , apoptosis , and host defense mechanisms .</sentence>
