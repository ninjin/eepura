<sentence id="0">Human monocyte binding to fibronectin enhances IFN-gamma-induced early signaling events .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Leukocyte integrins are fundamentally important in modulating adhesion to extracellular matrix components and to other cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This integrin-mediated adhesion controls leukocyte arrest and extravasation during the onset of inflammatory responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , integrin-ligand interactions trigger signaling pathways that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> influence leukocyte phenotype and function at sites of inflammation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the current studies , we evaluated the combinatorial effects of monocyte adhesion and IFN-gamma on intracellular signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IFN-gamma triggers a well-defined signal transduction pathway , which although not directly stimulated by monocyte adherence to fibronectin or arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-coated substrata , was enhanced significantly in these matrix-adherent cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Compared with monocytes in suspension or adherent on plastic surfaces , monocytes adherent to fibronectin or RGD exhibited a greater than threefold increase in steady state levels of IFN-gamma-induced mRNA for the high affinity Fc gammaRI receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">By electrophoretic mobility shift assays , this increase in mRNA was associated with a 5- to 10-fold increase in the STAT1-containing DNA-binding complex that binds to Fc gammaRI promoter elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 was enhanced significantly in RGD-adherent monocytes compared with control cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> a novel mechanism by which integrin-mediated cell adhesion can modulate the magnitude of cytokine-induced signal transduction pathways , thereby amplifying cellular events leading to monocyte activation and inflammation</scope> .</sentence>
