<sentence id="0">Retinoid X receptor and c-cerbA/thyroid hormone receptor regulate erythroid cell growth and differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nuclear receptors are important regulators of erythroid cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we investigated the impact of retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) , and of the c-erbA/thyroid hormone ( T3 ) receptor ( c-erbA/TR ) on growth and differentiation of erythroid cells using an in vitro culture system of stem cell factor-dependent erythroid progenitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">RXR , RAR , and c-erbA/TR-specific ligands were found to induce erythroid-specific gene expression and to accelerate erythroid differentiation in culture , with T3 being most effective .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR accelerated differentiation , unliganded c-erbA/TR effectively blocked differentiation and supported sustained progenitor growth in culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="0"> c-erbA/TR <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to act as a binary switch affecting erythroid cell fate</scope> : unliganded c-erbA/TR supports growth while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR induces differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , to determine the impact of RXR for erythroid cell development , dominant interfering mutant RXRs , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacking</cue> the transcriptional activator functions AF-1 and AF-2 , or AF-2 only , or the entire DNA-binding domain</scope> , were introduced into erythroid progenitor cells via recombinant retrovirus vectors and analyzed for RXR-specific effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It was found that expression of wild-type RXR and of the RXR mutants devoid of AF-1 and/or AF-2 supported a transient outgrowth of erythroid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In marked contrast , expression of the dominant interfering deltaDNA-binding domain RXR , containing a deletion of the entire DNA-binding domain , was incompatible with erythroid cell growth in vitro , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a pivotal role of RXR for erythroid cell development</scope> .</sentence>
