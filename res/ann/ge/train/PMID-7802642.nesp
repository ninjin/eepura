<sentence id="0">Platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) positively auto-regulates the expression of human PAF receptor transcript 1 ( leukocyte-type ) through NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human platelet-activating factor receptor ( PAFR ) gene is transcribed by two distinct promoters ( promoter 1 and promoter 2 ) to generate two transcripts ( designated as PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 ) , though their open reading frames are identical .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">By primer extension analysis to discriminate two transcripts , we found that the levels of PAFR transcript 1 ( leukocyte-type ) , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> PAFR transcript 2 ( tissue-type )</scope> , are upregulated by PAF as well as by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) in the human stomach cancer cell line ( JR-St cells ) which expresses both functional PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 endogenously .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Functional analysis of the promoter 1 with a transient expression assay using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene as a reporter showed that both PAF and TPA activated the promoter 1 but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> the deleted promoter <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacking</cue> the three consensus binding sites for NF-kappa B located from -571 bp to -459 bp</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a molecular mechanism of positive regulation of PAFR gene expression by PAF through NF-kappa B , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possibly</cue> by a phosphorylation reaction involving protein kinase C by PAF</scope></scope> .</sentence>
