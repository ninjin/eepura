<sentence id="0">Involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial adhesion molecule induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Induction of endothelial adhesion molecules by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) can occur independently of protein kinase C and activation of a protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) has recently been implicated in the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1 ) by interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) on endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate that the PTK inhibitors herbimycin A or genistein suppress induction of endothelial VCAM-1 and E-selectin , as well as subsequent monocytic cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by TNF .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Inhibition studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> specific tyrosine phosphorylation following PTK activation is involved in the mobilization of the transcription factor , nuclear factor kappa B , and VCAM-1 mRNA expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> have implications for pathophysiological conditions that involve the upregulation of these molecules ( e.g. inflammation and atherosclerosis )</scope> .</sentence>
