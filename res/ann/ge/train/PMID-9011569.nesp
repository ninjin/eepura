<sentence id="0">Glycation-dependent , reactive oxygen species-mediated suppression of the insulin gene promoter activity in HIT cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Prolonged poor glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients often leads to a decline in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells , accompanied by a decrease in the insulin content of the cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As a step toward elucidating the pathophysiological background of the so-called glucose toxicity to pancreatic beta cells , we induced glycation in HIT-T15 cells using a sugar with strong deoxidizing activity , D-ribose , and examined the effects on insulin gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The results of reporter gene analyses revealed that the insulin gene promoter is more sensitive to glycation than the control beta-actin gene promoter ; approximately 50 and 80 % of the insulin gene promoter activity was lost when the cells were kept for 3 d in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In agreement with this , decrease in the insulin mRNA and insulin content was observed in the glycation-induced cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Also , gel mobility shift analyses using specific antiserum revealed decrease in the DNA-binding activity of an insulin gene transcription factor , PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="0"> These effects of D-ribose <cue type="spec" id="0">seemed</cue> almost irreversible</scope> but could be prevented by addition of 1 mM aminoguanidine or 10 mM N-acetylcysteine , thus <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that glycation and reactive oxygen species , generated through the glycation reaction , serve as mediators of the phenomena</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These observations <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that protein glycation in pancreatic beta cells , which occurs in vivo under chronic hyperglycemia , suppresses insulin gene transcription and thus can explain part of the beta cell glucose toxicity</scope> .</sentence>
