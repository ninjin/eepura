<sentence id="0">HIV does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this report , we demonstrate that the T cell tropic strain of HIV , LAI , does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> replicate in naive CD4 T cells stimulated by cross-linking CD3 and CD28</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In contrast , LAI replicates well in memory CD4 T cells stimulated in the same way .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Unlike this physiologically relevant stimulation , PHA stimulates productive LAI replication in both naive and memory T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These studies were conducted with highly purified ( FACS-isolated ) subsets of CD4 T cells identified by expression of both CD45RA and CD62L .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Remixing of purified T cells showed that naive T cells do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> suppress LAI replication in memory T cells</scope> and that memory T cells do <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> restore LAI expression in naive T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The suppression of productive LAI replication in naive T cells is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> due to differential expression of viral coreceptors , <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">nor</cue> is it due to inhibition of activation of the important HIV transcription factors , nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The inherent resistance of naive T cells to productive HIV infection , coupled with their proliferative advantage as demonstrated here , provides a sound basis for proposed clinical therapies using ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of CD4 T cells from HIV-infected adults .</sentence>
