<sentence id="0">Coexpression of the interleukin-13 and interleukin-4 genes correlates with their physical linkage in the cytokine gene cluster on human chromosome 5q23-31 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-13 ( IL-13 ) and IL-4 are cytokines produced by T cells that are encoded by the q23-31 region of human chromosome 5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the regulation of IL-13 gene expression by T cells , we isolated and sequenced the human IL-13 gene , analyzed its 5'-flanking region for <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> transcriptional activation elements</scope> , and examined its expression in nontransformed T-lineage cell populations .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The human IL-13 gene was located 12.5-kb upstream of the IL-4 gene and 2-kb downstream of a CpG island .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The IL-13 gene 5' flank region included a segment with sequence homology to P elements of the IL-4 promoter involved in transcriptional activation in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutation of the IL-13 P element site significantly reduced IL-13 promoter activity in response to T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Oligonucleotides containing the IL-13 or IL-4 P element sites specifically bound the transcriptional activator protein , nuclear factor-activated T cells , preformed ( NF-ATp ) , when incubated with nuclear protein extracts from activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similar to IL-4 , IL-13 mRNA expression was highest in T-cell populations enriched for cells that had previously been primed in vivo or in vitro , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> priming increases the expression of the IL-13 and IL-4 genes in a coordinate manner</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Because the primed T cells contain higher levels of nuclear NF-ATp , capable of binding to P elements of the IL-4 and IL-13 promoters , than do freshly-isolated T cells , the NF-AT-binding P elements are attractive candidates to mediate the coordinate expression of these two cytokine genes .</sentence>
