<sentence id="0">Suppression of TNFalpha-mediated NFkappaB activity by myricetin and other flavonoids through downregulating the activity of IKK in ECV304 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Flavonoids are a group of naturally-occurring phenolic compounds in the plant kingdom , and many flavonoids are found with vascular protective properties .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Nevertheless how the protective response is exerted by flavonoids is not well characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In view of the nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis</scope> , prevention of the activation of NFkappaB represents an important role in protecting vascular injury .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , the effects of flavonoids on NFkappaB/inhibitor-kappaB ( IkappaB ) system in ECV304 cells activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) were examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We investigated the inhibitory action of six flavonoids on IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) activity , an enzyme recently found to phosphorylate critical serine residues of IkappaB for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Of six flavonoids tested , myricetin was found to strongly inhibit IKK kinase activity , and prevent the degradation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta in activated endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , myricetin was also found to inhibit NFkappaB activity correlated with suppression of monocyte adhesion to ECV304 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore we conclude that flavonoids <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be of therapeutic value for vascular disease through down regulation of NFkappaB/IkappaB system</scope> .</sentence>
