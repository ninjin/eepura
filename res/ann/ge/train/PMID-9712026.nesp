<sentence id="0">A CD28-associated signaling pathway leading to cytokine gene transcription and T cell proliferation <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> TCR engagement</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28-specific mAb BW 828 induces proliferation and cytokine synthesis <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> further requirement for TCR coengagement</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This observation prompted us to postulate that signal 2 ( costimulatory signal ) alone <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> signal 1 ( TCR signal )</scope> can activate T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To test <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> this <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">putative</cue> function of CD28</scope> is mediated via a particular signaling pathway</scope> , we compared early signaling events initiated in resting T cells by the stimulatory mAb BW 828 with signals triggered by the nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9.3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ , but did <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56(lck) and c-Raf-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This pathway resulted in the induction of the transcription factors NF-kappa B , NF-AT , and proteins binding to the CD28 response element of the IL-2 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the other hand , stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ and triggered the activation of p56(lck) and c-Raf-1 , but <scope type="neg" id="6">was <cue type="neg" id="6">unable</cue> to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast to the differential signaling of BW 828 and 9.3 in resting T cells , the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in activated T cells and Jurkat cells ( p56(lck) activation , association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with CD28 ) , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicating that</cue> the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data support the view that stimulation through CD28 can induce some effector functions in T cells and <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggest</cue> that this capacity is associated with a particular pattern of early signaling events</scope> .</sentence>
