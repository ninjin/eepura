<sentence id="0">The small GTP-binding protein Rho potentiates AP-1 transcription in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure , gene transcription , specific cell fate development , and transformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate in this report that overexpression of an activated form of Rho enhances AP-1 activity in Jurkat T cells in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , but activated Rho ( V14Rho ) has little or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on NFAT , Oct-1 , and NF-kappaB enhancer element activities under similar conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Overexpression of a V14Rho construct incapable of membrane localization ( CAAX deleted ) abolishes PMA-induced AP-1 transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The effect of Rho on AP-1 is independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , as a dominant-negative MEK and a MEK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect Rho-induced AP-1 activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">V14Rho binds strongly to protein kinase Calpha ( PKCalpha ) in vivo ; however , deletion of the CAAX site on V14Rho severely diminished this association .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Evidence for a role for PKCalpha as an effector of Rho was obtained by the observation that coexpression of the N-terminal domain of PKCalpha blocked the effects of activated Rho plus PMA on AP-1 transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that Rho potentiates AP-1 transcription during T-cell activation</scope> .</sentence>
