<sentence id="0">Transcriptional regulation of interleukin 3 ( IL3 ) in primary human T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Role of AP-1- and octamer-binding proteins in control of IL3 gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have investigated the molecular and biochemical basis for activation of interleukin 3 ( IL3 ) gene expression in primary human T lymphocytes following CD3 and CD2 receptor stimulation or activation by phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using transfection and reporter gene assays specifically designed for primary T lymphocytes in conjunction with gel retardation assays , Western blot analyses and UV cross-linking studies , we found that c-Jun , c-Fos , and octamer-binding proteins play a major role in transcriptional activation of the IL3 gene via their interaction with two specific regions contained within the IL3 5'-flanking sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Additionally , the region between bases -107 and -59 of the IL3 promoter containing <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> AP-2 and Sp1 binding motifs</scope> appears necessary for basal level expression of the IL3 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The data also <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> CD2 receptor activation and phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation augment T cell IL3 gene expression through the same cis- and trans-activating signals</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">should</cue> contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of IL3 gene expression in human T lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
