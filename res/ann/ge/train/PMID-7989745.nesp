<sentence id="0">Differential regulation of proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos in T lymphocytes activated through CD28 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The T cell surface molecule CD28 binds to ligands on accessory cells and APCs , playing an important costimulatory role in the response of T cells to Ags. Our knowledge of the intracellular signaling pathways coupled to this receptor is incomplete .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition to activation of phospholipase C gamma 1 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> ligation of this receptor also <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> to activate a calcium-independent , CD28-specific pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this paper , we report that cross-linking of CD28 ( but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> CD2 , CD5 , LFA-1 , or CD7 )</scope> leads to an elevation of c-jun mRNA , with only minimal activation of c-fos expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">CD28-dependent induction of c-jun expression requires protein tyrosine kinase activity , but does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> depend on activation of a phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C or elevation of cytosolic calcium</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <scope type="neg" id="3">CD28-dependent elevation of c-jun mRNA does <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="4">appear</cue> to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="7"> A mechanism is <cue type="spec" id="7">suggested</cue> whereby expression of c-jun and junB , in the <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">absence</cue> of members of the fos family</scope> , can prevent inappropriate activation of T cells caused by ligation of CD28 in the <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">absence</cue> of a specific antigenic stimulus</scope></scope> .</sentence>
