<sentence id="0">Human immunodeficiency virus type-2 gene expression : two enhancers and their activation by T-cell activators .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human immunodeficiency viruses ( HIVs ) <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> include a spectrum of retroviruses with varying potential to infect their host , undergo long periods of latent infection , and induce pathology</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Since expression of the viruses is in large part regulated by the sequence elements in their long terminal repeats ( LTRs ) , this study was directed to an analysis of the regulatory elements in the HIV-2 LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The HIV-2 LTR was found to contain two enhancers .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One of these enhancers is , in part , identical to the HIV-1 enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This enhancer in HIV-1 is the T-cell activation response element ; in HIV-2 , however , it is the second enhancer that is mainly responsible for activation in response to T-cell activators .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The second enhancer interacts with two nuclear binding proteins ( 85 kD and 27 kD mobility ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> that <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to be required for optimal enhancer function and activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Observations such as these encourage the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">speculation</cue> that there <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be subtle differences in the regulation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 expression that <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be relevant to the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possible</cue> longer latency and reduced pathogenicity of HIV-2</scope></scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
