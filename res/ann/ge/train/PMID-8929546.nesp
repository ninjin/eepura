<sentence id="0">Regulation of cytokine and cytokine receptor expression by glucocorticoids .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoids ( GCS ) profoundly inhibit several aspects of T cell immunity largely through inhibition of cytokine expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">GCS were also reported to act indirectly by inducing transforming growth factor-beta expression , which in turn blocks T cell immunity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In exerting their antiproliferative effects , GCS diffuse into target cells where they bind their cytoplasmic receptor , which in turn translocates to the nucleus where it inhibits transcription of cytokine genes <scope type="spec" id="0"> through direct binding to the glucocorticoid response elements ( GRE ) , which are located in the promoter region of cytokine genes <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> , alternatively , through antagonism of the action of transcription factors required for optimal transcriptional activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast to their inhibitory effects on cytokine expression , GCS up-regulate cytokine receptor expression that correlates with enhanced cytokine effects on target cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this review , we summarize the current state of knowledge of the mechanism of action of GCS , including the phenomenon of steroid-induced rebound , which ensues upon GCS withdrawal .</sentence>
