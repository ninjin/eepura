<sentence id="0">Expression of erythroid-specific genes in megakaryoblastic disorders .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Currently available data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation pathways are closely related to each other , and there <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> exist progenitor cells common to those two lineages <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> exist</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AML-M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These blast cells express lineage-specific transcription factors such as GATA-1 common to these lineages and frequently express erythroid-specific mRNAs such as gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS-E ) , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> most of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that blasts in M7 and TMD <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> correspond to progenitors of both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages</scope></scope> .</sentence>
