<sentence id="0">Cortivazol mediated induction of glucocorticoid receptor messenger ribonucleic acid in wild-type and dexamethasone-resistant human leukemic ( CEM ) cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cortivazol is a phenylpyrazolo glucocorticoid of high potency and unusual structure .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In both wild-type and highly dexamethasone(dex)-resistant clones of the human leukemic cell line CEM , exposure to cortivazol leads to cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It has been shown recently that in wild-type CEM cells but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in a dex-resistant , glucocorticoid receptor(GR)-defective clone ICR-27 TK-3</scope> , dex induces GR mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To test the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that cortivazol acts in dex-resistant cells by making use of the residual GR found there</scope> , wild-type and dex-resistant clones were treated with various concentrations of cortivazol and induction of GR mRNA was studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Cortivazol significantly induced GR mRNA in the normal CEM-C7 as well as in two classes of dex-resistant clones , although the dex-resistant clones needed at least 10 times more cortivazol than the normal cells for significant GR mRNA induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Increased levels of GR mRNA were noticed as early as 3 h after treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A general correlation between induction of GR mRNA and lysis of the normal and dex-resistant cells was found .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Positive induction of GR mRNA <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be one of the earliest crucial steps in the lysis of normal and dex-resistant CEM cells</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">or</cue> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">might</cue> serve as a marker for the process</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , the lysis pathway in the dex-resistant cells is defective in that dex-resistant clones needed significantly more cortivazol than the normal cells for lysis of the cells .</sentence>
