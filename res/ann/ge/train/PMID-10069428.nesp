<sentence id="0">Evidence for suppressed activity of the transcription factor NFAT1 at its proximal binding element P0 in the IL-4 promoter associated with enhanced IL-4 gene transcription in T cells of atopic patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Allergen-specific T cells in atopic patients are polarized IL-4-producing Th2 cells , promoting IgE synthesis by B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The molecular basis for increased IL-4 gene expression in atopy is not fully understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IL-4 gene regulation in general involves the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family of transcription factors , of which NFAT1 and NFAT2 are most prominent in peripheral T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recently , a unique inhibitory role of NFAT1 in IL-4 gene control was shown in the mouse .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays with protein extracts of highly polarized Th2 clones from atopics and Th1 clones from controls we compared DNA-binding activities at the two NFAT-binding elements P0 and P1 of the crucial proximal human IL-4 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">At the most proximal P0 site , NFAT-containing complexes devoid of NFAT2 were readily inducible in the Th1 clones , but hardly or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in the Th2 clones</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , both in Th1 and Th2 clones NFAT-containing complexes were strongly inducible at the P1 site , consisting of NFAT2 and a P0-compatible NFAT activity , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> apparent differences between Th1 and Th2 clones</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Like in Th2 clones , suppressed NFAT-P0 complex formation was observed also at the polyclonal level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) of three of five severe atopic dermatitis patients with strongly elevated serum IgE levels , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in control PBMC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that high-level IL-4 production in atopic Th2 cells is associated with selective reduction of suppressive NFAT1 activity at the IL-4 P0 element and that some patients with this multifactorial disease <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> have a <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">putative</cue> systemic disorder</scope> at this level</scope></scope> .</sentence>
