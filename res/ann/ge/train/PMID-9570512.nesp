<sentence id="0">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat quasispecies differ in basal transcription and nuclear factor recruitment in human glial cells and lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The generation of genomic diversity during the course of infection has the potential to affect all aspects of HIV-1 replication , including expression of the proviral genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat ( LTR ) sequence diversity on LTR-directed gene expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Sequence analysis of nineteen LTRs cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes ( with respect to the sequence of the LAI LTR ) within the 455-bp U3 region .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the LAI LTR in U-373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a CD4-positive lymphocyte cell line ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While LTRs which demonstrated the highest activities in U-373 MG cells also yielded high activities in Jurkat cells , the LTRs were generally more active in Jurkat cells when compared to the LAI LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Differences in LTR sequence also resulted in differences in transcription factor recruitment to cis-acting sites within the U3 region of the LTR , as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted transcription factor binding to an activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding ( ATF/CREB ) binding site ( located between the LEF-1 and distal NF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites ) that we identified in previous studies of the HIV-1 LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that LTR sequence changes can significantly affect basal LTR function and transcription factor recruitment , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> , in turn , alter the course of viral replication in cells of CNS and immune system origin</scope></scope> .</sentence>
