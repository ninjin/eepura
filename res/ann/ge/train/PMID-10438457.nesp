<sentence id="0">Protein kinase C and calcineurin synergize to activate IkappaB kinase and NF-kappaB in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The nuclear factor of kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is key in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">T cell receptor ( TCR ) cross-linking is in part required for activation of NF-kappaB , which is dependent on the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes , we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR-initiated signal transduction , protein kinase C ( PKC ) and calcineurin , results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase ( IKK ) complex but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase , p90(rsk)</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also demonstrate that the IKK complex , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> p90(rsk)</scope> , is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Each second messenger is necessary , as inhibition of either one reverses the activation of the IKK complex and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Overexpression of dominant negative forms of IKKalpha and -beta demonstrates that only IKKbeta is the target for PKC and calcineurin .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> within the TCR/CD3 signal transduction pathway both PKC and calcineurin are required for the effective activation of the IKK complex and NF-kappaB in T lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
