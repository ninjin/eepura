<sentence id="0">The macrophage transcription factor PU.1 directs tissue-specific expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion from two distinct promoters in monocytes/macrophages and the placenta .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In order to further understand the transcription factors which play a role in the commitment of multipotential progenitors to the monocyte/macrophage lineage , we have initiated an investigation of the factors which activate the M-CSF receptor very early during the monocyte differentiation process .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we demonstrate that the human monocytic M-CSF receptor promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Since one of the few transcription factors which have been implicated in the regulation of monocyte genes is the macrophage- and B-cell-specific PU.1 transcription factor , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> PU.1 binds and activates the M-CSF receptor promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we demonstrate that both in vitro-translated PU.1 and PU.1 from nuclear extracts bind to a specific site in the M-CSF receptor promoter just upstream from the major transcription initiation site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutations in this site which eliminate PU.1 binding decrease M-CSF receptor promoter activity significantly in macrophage cell lines only .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , PU.1 transactivates the M-CSF receptor promoter in nonmacrophage cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that PU.1 plays a major role in macrophage gene regulation and development by directing the expression of a receptor for a key macrophage growth factor</scope> .</sentence>
