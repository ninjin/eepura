<sentence id="0">A nuclear factor NF-GM2 that interacts with a regulatory region of the GM-CSF gene essential for its induction in responses to T-cell activation : purification from human T-cell leukemia line Jurkat cells and similarity to NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of T cells by antigen , lectin , or a combination of phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) leads to the induction of genes for a set of lymphokines , including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrated in earlier studies that the upstream region of the mouse GM-CSF promoter at positions between -95 and -73 is essential for transcriptional activation in response to PMA/A23187 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This region contains two DNA-binding motifs , GM2 and GC-box .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The GM2 sequence ( GGTAGTTCCC ) is recognized by an inducible factor NF-GM2 ; the other ( CCGCCC ) by constitutive factors A1 , A2 , and B. To elucidate the mechanism of GM-CSF gene activation , we have purified the inducible factor NF-GM2 from the nuclear extract of stimulated Jurkat cells on the basis of specific DNA-binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The purified NF-GM2 consists of 50 ( p50 ) and 65 kDa ( p65 ) polypeptides and has a binding activity specific for both the GM-CSF and immunoglobulin kappa ( GGAAAGTCCC ) enhancers .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Electrophoretically purified p50 alone can form a protein-DNA complex , but in the mixture , p50 associates preferentially with p65 to form the NF-GM2 complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , p65 gave per se , with low affinity , a protein-DNA complex that migrated more slowly than native NF-GM2 complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , an antiserum against KBF1 ( identical to 50 kDa NF-kappa B protein ) reacted with the p50 of NF-GM2 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the NF-GM2 polypeptide cannot be immunologically differentiated from the 50 kDa subunit of NF-kappa B. The purified NF-GM2 activated in vitro transcription from the kappa B enhancer , while it <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter harboring the GM2 sequence</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that the activation mechanism of the GM-CSF gene through the GM2/GC-box sequence is different from that of genes carrying the kappa B enhancer alone</scope> .</sentence>
