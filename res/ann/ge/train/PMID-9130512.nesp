<sentence id="0">Retinoic acid-induced modulation of IL-2 mRNA production and IL-2 receptor expression on T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Retinoic acid ( RA ) has important immune-modulating effects on both T and B cell function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Our laboratory has shown that RA can enhance in vitro polyclonal B cell immunoglobulin ( Ig ) response .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Investigating cytokines known to affect B cell differentiation , we have recently shown that IL-6 production is augmented by RA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study we have examined the immune modulating effects of RA on IL-2 mRNA , another important cytokine for B cell immunoglobulin production , the expression of IL-2 receptors on T cells , and the RA nuclear receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">METHODS : Purified T cells were obtained from adenoidal tissues , and incubated with RA ( 10(-7) M ) or DMSO solvent/media control for 0 , 6-8 , and 24 h. Total mRNA was extracted from T cells , and using RT-PCR , changes in the production of IL-2 and RA receptors (RAR)-alpha , beta , gamma mRNA were determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The effects of RA on IL-2-alpha receptor expression was determined by flow cytometry on T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">CONCLUSION : These studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that RA can augment IL-2 mRNA production by T cells with a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> paracrine effect on IL-2R-alpha expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="2"> These changes <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to be mediated by RAR-alpha</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , IL-2 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be another important cytokine modulated by RA in the immune response</scope> .</sentence>
