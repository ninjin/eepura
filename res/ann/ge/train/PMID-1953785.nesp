<sentence id="0">Regulation of interleukin-1 beta production by glucocorticoids in human monocytes : the mechanism of action depends on the activation signal .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoids are known to downregulate interleukin-1 beta production in monocytic cells by two different mechanims : direct inhibition of the gene transcription and destabilization of the preformed interleukin-1 beta mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Now we have examined the effect of the nature of the monocyte activating signal on these two inhibitory mechanims .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">When human monocytes were preincubated with dexamethasone for 1 hour and then stimulated either with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristate , it was found that dexamethasone inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta protein production , but the phorbol myristate-induced production was increased 3-10 fold .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This difference was also seen at the mRNA level .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When dexamethasone was added to the cultures 3 hours after the stimulators , it clearly decreased the interleukin-1 beta mRNA levels regardless of the stimulator used ( although the effect was clearly weaker on the PMA-induced mRNA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus these data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the phorbol myristate-induced signal ( prolonged protein kinase C activation ? ) cannot be inhibited by prior incubation with dexamethasone and it also protects the induced mRNA for the degradative action of dexamethasone</scope> .</sentence>
