<sentence id="0">Intranuclear targeted delivery of functional NF-kappaB by 70 kDa heat shock protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The 70 kDa heat shock protein ( Hsp70 ) is a highly conserved , ubiquitous protein involved in chaperoning proteins to various cellular organelles .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that when added exogenously to cells , Hsp70 is readily imported into both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in a cell-type-specific fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We exploited this ability of Hsp70 to deliver NF-kappaB , a key transcriptional regulator of inflammatory responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We demonstrate that a fusion protein composed of a C-terminal Hsp70 peptide and the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB was directed into the nucleus of cells , could bind DNA specifically , and activated Igkappa expression and TNFalpha production .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We therefore <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that Hsp70 can be used as a vehicle for intracytoplasmic and intranuclear delivery of proteins or DNA to modulate gene expression and thereby control immune responses</scope> .</sentence>
