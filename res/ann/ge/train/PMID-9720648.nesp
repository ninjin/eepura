<sentence id="0">Nuclear factor-kappaB induction in CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ T cell subsets during aging .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An increase in the ratio of memory to naive T cells has been postulated to underlie immune hyporesponsiveness accompanying aging .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Our analyses of the induction of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFkappaB ) in activated memory ( CD45RO+ ) and naive ( CD45RA+ ) T cell subsets from young and elderly donors has demonstrated that , regardless of donor age , memory T cells are not significantly altered in their responsiveness to TNF-alpha-mediated induction of NFkappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although treatment with TNF-alpha induced nuclear localization of NFkappaB in both memory and naive T cell subsets , irrespective of the age of the donor , the levels of induced NFkappaB were significantly lower in both subsets of T cells obtained from the elderly , when compared to those in young .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Examination of IkappaB alpha regulation revealed that TNF-alpha-mediated degradation of IkappaB alpha in both memory and naive T cells from the elderly was severely impaired , thus contributing to the lowered induction of the observed NFkappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , this age-related decrease in induction of nuclear NFkappaB correlated with decrease in intracellular IL-2 receptor expression and anti-CD3-induced proliferation of both memory and naive T cells subsets .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the age-related hyporesponsiveness cannot be attributed to a skewing of the T cell population towards a memory phenotype in the elderly</scope> .</sentence>
