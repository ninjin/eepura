<sentence id="0">Stimulation of neutrophil interleukin-8 production by eosinophil granule major basic protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We evaluated the ability of eosinophil granule major basic protein ( MBP ) to stimulate interleukin (IL)-8 production by neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">MBP over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 microM stimulated the release of up to approximately 8 ng/ml IL-8 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Incubation with 2 microM MBP showed that , after a 1 h lag , the level of IL-8 release increased with time for approximately 10 h. At the 2 microM concentration , eosinophil cationic protein , eosinophil-derived neurotoxin , and eosinophil peroxidase did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> stimulate significant levels of IL-8 production</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">MBP</cue> stimulated 2-fold increases in IL-8 messenger RNA</scope> ( mRNA ) after 1 and 3 h of incubation , which were blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D. However , stimulation with MBP did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB or activator protein-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">No</cue> NF-IL-6 binding activity was detected in the same nuclear extracts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , stimulation with MBP prolonged the stability of IL-8 mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">MBP also induced transient increases in mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta , but did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> stimulate the release of either chemokine</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> MBP is selective among the eosinophil granule proteins as a stimulus for neutrophil IL-8 release and , further , that stimulation of neutrophil IL-8 release by MBP involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We postulate that MBP-induced release of IL-8 by neutrophils <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> contribute to the pathophysiology of acute asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases</scope> .</sentence>
