<sentence id="0">Cyclosporin A inhibits monocyte tissue factor activation in cardiac transplant recipients .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Fibrin deposition and thrombosis have been implicated in both allograft rejection and vasculopathy after cardiac transplantation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because monocytes play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of intravascular coagulation activation through their ability to synthesize tissue factor ( TF ) , we asked ( 1 ) <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> monocyte TF activation occurs in cardiac transplant recipients</scope> and ( 2 ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> monocyte TF expression is affected by treatment with cyclosporin A ( CsA )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS AND RESULTS : We measured levels of TF activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and highly purified monocytes/macrophages from 10 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients and 10 healthy control subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TF activity generated by both unstimulated and endotoxin-stimulated cells was significantly higher in transplant recipients than in control subjects ( P<.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Increased monocyte TF expression in transplant recipients was shown to be adversely affected by treatment with CsA : TF induction was markedly reduced by CsA serum concentrations reaching peak CsA drug levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inhibition of TF induction in the presence of high CsA blood concentrations was also observed when stimulation of cells was performed with interferon-gamma or interleukin-1beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and electrophoretic mobility shift assay , respectively , treatment with CsA leads to decreased TF mRNA expression and reduced activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor , which is known to contribute to the induction of the TF promotor in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that TF activation , occurring in mononuclear cells of cardiac transplant recipients , is inhibited by treatment with CsA .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Inhibition of monocyte TF induction by CsA <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> contribute to its successful use in cardiac transplant medicine</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> be useful in managing further settings of vascular pathology also known to involve TF expression and NF-kappaB activation</scope> .</sentence>
