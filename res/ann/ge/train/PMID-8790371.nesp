<sentence id="1">Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV ) protease in cultured cells leads to apoptosis , preceded by cleavage of bcl-2 , a key negative regulator of cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In contrast , a high level of bcl-2 protects cells in vitro and in vivo from the viral protease and prevents cell death following HIV infection of human lymphocytes , while reducing the yields of viral structural proteins , infectivity , and tumor necrosis factor alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We present a model for HIV replication in which the viral protease depletes the infected cells of bcl-2 , leading to oxidative stress-dependent activation of NF kappa B , a cellular factor required for HIV transcription , and ultimately to cell death .</sentence>
