<sentence id="4">The present paper studies the expression of the NM23.H1 gene in cell lines which derive from primary or metastatic human malignant melanomas in relation to staging , infiltration degree , lymphocytic infiltration , cell morphology , cell pigmentation , karyotype , and disease-free survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The level of mRNA expression of the NM23 gene is significantly lower in cell lines that derive from more infiltrating primary melanomas than in cell lines obtained from less infiltrating tumours .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , cell lines derived from tumours of patients with a disease-free survival of more than 24 months ( 24-58 months ) express the NM23 gene at higher levels than cell lines obtained from melanomas of patients with a disease-free survival of less than 24 months ( 6-15 months ) .</sentence>
