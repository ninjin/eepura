<sentence id="0">3-deazaadenosine , a S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor , has dual effects on NF-kappaB regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and promotion of IkappaBalpha degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previously we reported that 3-deazaadenosine ( DZA ) , a potent inhibitor and substrate for S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibits bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we demonstrate the effects of DZA on nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DZA inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB through the hindrance of p65 ( Rel-A ) phosphorylation <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> reduction of its nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The inhibitory effect of DZA on NF-kappaB transcriptional activity is potentiated by the addition of homocysteine .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , DZA promotes the proteolytic degradation of IkappaBalpha , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> IkappaBbeta</scope> , resulting in an increase of DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB in the nucleus in the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of its transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The reduction of IkappaBalpha by DZA is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">neither</cue> involved in IkappaB kinase complex activation <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">nor</cue> modulated by the addition of homocysteine</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This study strongly <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that DZA <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be a potent drug for the treatment of diseases in which NF-kappaB plays a central pathogenic role , as well as a useful tool for studying the regulation and physiological functions of NF-kappaB</scope></scope> .</sentence>
