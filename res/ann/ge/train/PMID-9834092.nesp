<sentence id="1">Activation of T lymphocytes by Ags or cytokines results in translocation of the transcription factors NF-kappa B , AP-1 , NFAT , and STAT from the cytoplasm into the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The first step in the nuclear import process is recognition of a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) within the karyophilic protein by a cytoplasmic receptor such as the importin (karyopherin)-alpha subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The NLSs of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , and NFAT differ and <scope type="neg" id="0">the NLS of STAT1 has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> yet been identified</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Herein we demonstrate that the inducible nuclear import of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , NFAT , and STAT1 in Jurkat T lymphocytes is significantly inhibited by a cell-permeable peptide carrying the NLS of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NLS peptide-mediated disruption of the nuclear import of these transcription factors results in inhibition of I kappa B alpha and IL-2 gene expression , processes dependent on NF-kappa B or the combination of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , and NFAT .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Further , we show that inhibitory NLS peptide interacts in vitro with a cytoplasmic NLS receptor complex comprised of the Rch1/importin (karyopherin)-beta heterodimer expressed in Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , these data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the inducible nuclear import of NF-kappa B , AP-1 , NFAT , and STAT1 in Jurkat T cells can be regulated by NLS peptide delivered noninvasively to the cytoplasm of Jurkat T cells to target members of the importin (karyopherin)-alpha beta NLS receptor complex</scope> .</sentence>
