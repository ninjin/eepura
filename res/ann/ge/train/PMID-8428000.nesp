<sentence id="0">Interleukin-3 expression by activated T cells involves an inducible , T-cell-specific factor and an octamer binding protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) is exclusively expressed by activated T and natural killer cells , a function that is tightly controlled both in a lineage-specific and in a stimulation-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have investigated the protein binding characteristics and functional importance of the ACT-1-activating region of the IL-3 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This region binds an inducible , T-cell-specific factor over its 5' end , a site that is necessary for the expression of IL-3 in the absence of other upstream elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Over its 3' end , it binds a factor that is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This factor is <scope type="spec" id="0"> Oct-1 <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> an immunologically related octamer-binding protein</scope> , and it plays a role in coordinating the activity of several regulatory elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These characteristics make the ACT-1 site analogous to the activating ARRE-1 site in the IL-2 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , and despite a <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of sequence homology</scope> , the promoters of IL-3 and IL-2 share an organizational pattern of regulatory elements <scope type="spec" id="2"> that is <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to be important for the T-cell-specific expression of these genes</scope> .</sentence>
