<sentence id="0">Role of HIV-1 Nef expression in activation pathways in CD4+ T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The role of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) Nef protein in T cell activation pathways was investigated using a Jurkat CD4+ cell line stably transfected with a Nef expression vector .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Secretion of IL-2 and TNF-alpha , surface expression of IL-2R , and DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B and AP-1 ( Fos/Jun ) complex in response to phorbol myristate acetate , TNF-alpha , or immobilized antibodies to CD3 were monitored .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0">These parameters were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> modified by Nef expression in Jurkat cells</scope> , whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of LTR activation in Nef+ Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="1">This inhibition was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr-15 or GTP-binding activity</scope> because mutations in critical sites did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> alter this inhibition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that inhibition of LTR activation was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> mediated through NF-kappa B-binding activity</scope> but through the region containing the negative responding elements ( NREs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that Nef downmodulates LTR activation <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> significantly inhibiting the capacity of T cells to respond to immunological activations</scope></scope> .</sentence>
