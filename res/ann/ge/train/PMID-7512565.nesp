<sentence id="0">Sp1 is a critical factor for the monocytic specific expression of human CD14 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD14 is a membrane glycoprotein expressed specifically on monocytes and macrophages , and its expression is markedly increased during the process of monocyte differentiation .</sentence>

<sentence id="3">A 5.5-kilobase genomic clone contained the full-length CD14 coding sequence and 4.2 kilobases of 5'-upstream sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One major and one minor transcription start site were identified 101 and 130 base pairs ( bp ) upstream , respectively , from the protein translation start ATG .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A DNA fragment containing 128 bp of upstream sequence had strong , monocyte-specific promoter activity in the CD14 positive monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as compared to the nonmonocytic cell lines HeLa and REX .</sentence>
