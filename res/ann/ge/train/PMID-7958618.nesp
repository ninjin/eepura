<sentence id="0">Functions of glutathione and glutathione disulfide in immunology and immunopathology .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Even a moderate increase in the cellular cysteine supply elevates the intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) and glutathione disulfide ( GSSG ) levels and potentiates immunological functions of lymphocytes in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">At low GSSG levels , T cells cannot optimally activate the immunologically important transcription factor NF kappa B , whereas high GSSG levels inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B. The effects of GSSG are antagonized by reduced thioredoxin ( TRX ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As the protein tyrosine kinase activities p56lck and p59fyn are activated in intact cells by hydrogen peroxide , they are <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> targets for GSSG action</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These redox-regulated enzymes trigger signal cascades for NF kappa B activation and transduce signals from the T cell antigen receptor , from CD4 and CD8 molecules , and from the IL-2 receptor beta-chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The effector phase of cytotoxic T cell responses and IL-2-dependent functions are inhibited even by a partial depletion of the intracellular GSH pool .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As signal transduction is facilitated by prooxidant conditions , we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that the well-known immunological consequences of GSH depletion ultimately <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be results of the accompanying GSSG deficiency</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As HIV-infected patients and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , significantly decreased plasma cyst(e)ine and intracellular GSH levels , we also <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesize</cue> that AIDS <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be the consequence of a GSSG deficiency as well</scope></scope> .</sentence>
