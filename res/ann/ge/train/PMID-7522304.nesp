<sentence id="0">Calcium signalling in T cells stimulated by a cyclophilin B-binding protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A blocks a calcium-dependent signal from the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) that normally leads to T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">When bound to cyclophilin , cyclosporin A binds and inactivates the key signalling intermediate calcineurin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To identify <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> cellular homologues of cyclosporin A that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> regulate calcium signalling</scope></scope> , we have cloned human genes encoding cyclophilin B-binding-proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One gene product , when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells , specifically induced transcription from the interleukin-2 enhancer , by activating the T-cell-specific transcription factors NF-AT and NF-IL2A .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This protein , termed calcium-signal modulating cyclophilin ligand ( CAML ) , acts downstream of the TCR and upstream of calcineurin by causing an influx of calcium .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="3"> CAML <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to be a new participant in the calcium-signal transduction pathway</scope> , implicating cyclophilin B in calcium signalling , even in the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of cyclosporin</scope> .</sentence>
