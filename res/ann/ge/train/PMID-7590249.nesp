<sentence id="0">Constitutive NF-kappa B activation , enhanced granulopoiesis , and neonatal lethality in I kappa B alpha-deficient mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factors belonging to the NF-kappa B family are controlled by inhibitory I kappa B proteins , mainly I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Apparently normal at birth , I kappa B alpha-/- mice exhibit severe runting , skin defects , and extensive granulopoiesis postnatally , typically dying by 8 days .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Hematopoietic tissues from these mice display elevated levels of both nuclear NF-kappa B and mRNAs of <scope type="spec" id="1"> some , but not all , genes <cue type="spec" id="1">thought</cue> to be regulated by NF-kappa B. NF-kappa B elevation</scope> results in these phenotypic abnormalities because mice <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> both I kappa B alpha and the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B</scope> show a dramatically delayed onset of abnormalities .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast to hematopoietic cells , I kappa B alpha-/- embryonic fibroblasts show minimal constitutive NF-kappa B , as well as normal signal-dependent NF-kappa B activation that is concomitant with I kappa B beta degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> I kappa b beta , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> I kappa B alpha</scope> , is required for the signal-dependent activation of NF-kappa B in fibroblasts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , I kappa B alpha is required for the postinduction repression of NF-kappa B in fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results define distinct roles for the two forms of I kappa B and demonstrate the necessity for stringent control of NF-kappa B.</sentence>
