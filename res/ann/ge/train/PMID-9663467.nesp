<sentence id="1">Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) acts on megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We isolated a novel subline , UT-7/GMT , from the human leukemia cell line UT-7/GM ( N. Komatsu , et al. , Blood , 89 : 4021-4033 , 1997 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A small population of UT-7/GM cells positively stained for hemoglobin ( Hb ) after a 7-day exposure to TPO .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">More than 50 % of TPO-treated UT-7/GMT cells positively stained for Hb. Using UT-7/GMT cells , we examined how TPO promotes hemoglobinization .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPO receptor but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> the erythropoietin ( EPO ) receptor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">There was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> competition between TPO and EPO for binding to EPO receptor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that TPO has a direct effect on hemoglobinization via a specific receptor on UT-7/GMT cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Isoelectric focusing demonstrated that TPO induced fetal and adult Hb synthesis , whereas EPO induced embryonic , fetal , and adult Hb synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , our data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that TPO has a distinct action on erythropoiesis</scope> .</sentence>
