<sentence id="0">Engagement of natural cytotoxicity programs regulates AP-1 expression in the NKL human NK cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NK cell cytotoxicity is a fast and efficient mechanism of target cell lysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using transcription analysis , such as multiplex messenger assays , we show here that natural cytotoxicity exerted by the human NKL cell line correlates with mRNA accumulation of very early activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factor genes such as JunB , FosB and c-Fos .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , DNA-binding activities of Jun-Fos heterodimers were observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays during the course of natural cytotoxicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interaction between immunoglobulin-like transcript-2/leukocyte Ig-like receptor 1 on NKL cells and HLA-B27 on target cells leads to an impairment of NKL natural cytotoxicity , which correlates with an <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of JunB , FosB , and c-Fos transcription</scope> , as well as an <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of their DNA-binding activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our studies thus <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> , despite the rapidity of NK cell-mediated lysis , AP-1 transcription factor is activated during the early stage of NK cell cytolytic programs and that engagement of NK cell inhibitory receptors for MHC class I molecules impairs the very early activation of AP-1</scope> .</sentence>
