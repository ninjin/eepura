<sentence id="0">Foxp3 Represses Retroviral Transcription by Targeting Both NF-==kappa==B and CREB Pathways</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Forkhead box (Fox)/winged-helix transcription factors regulate multiple aspects of immune responsiveness and Foxp3 is recognized as an essential functional marker of regulatory T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Herein we describe downstream signaling pathways targeted by Foxp3 that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> negatively impact retroviral pathogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Overexpression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T and purified CD4+ T cells resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent decrease in basal levels of nuclear factor-==kappa==B ( NF-==kappa==B ) activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal forkhead ( FKH ) domain , critical for nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity , abrogated the ability of Foxp3 to suppress NF-==kappa==B activity in HEK 293T cells , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in Jurkat or primary human CD4+ T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We further demonstrate that Foxp3 suppressed the transcription of two human retroviral promoters ( HIV-1 and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I [ HTLV-I ] ) utilizing NF-==kappa==B-dependent and NF-==kappa==B-independent mechanisms .</sentence>
