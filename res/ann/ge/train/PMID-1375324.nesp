<sentence id="0">The promoter of the CD19 gene is a target for the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The CD19 protein is expressed on the surface of all B-lymphoid cells <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">with the</cue> exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells</scope> and has been implicated as a signal-transducing receptor in the control of proliferation and differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we demonstrate complete correlation between the expression pattern of the CD19 gene and the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP in a large panel of B-lymphoid cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The human CD19 gene has been cloned , and several BSAP-binding sites have been mapped by in vitro protein-DNA binding studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In particular , a high-affinity BSAP-binding site <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">instead of</cue> a TATA sequence</scope> is located in the -30 promoter region upstream of a cluster of heterogeneous transcription start sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , this site is occupied by BSAP in vivo in a CD19-expressing B-cell line but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in plasma or HeLa cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This high-affinity site has been conserved in the promoters of both human and mouse CD19 genes and was furthermore shown to confer B-cell specificity to a beta-globin reporter gene in transient transfection experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , BSAP was found to be the only abundant DNA-binding activity of B-cell nuclear extracts that interacts with the CD19 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , this evidence strongly <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">implicates</cue> BSAP in the regulation of the CD19 gene</scope> .</sentence>
