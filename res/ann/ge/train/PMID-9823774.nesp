<sentence id="0">Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor activates a 72-kDa isoform of STAT3 in human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) signaling involves activation of STATs , proteins that serve the dual function of signal transduction and activation of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously demonstrated that G-CSF activated a distinct Stat3-like protein in immature and mature normal myeloid cells , StatG .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">StatG in normal immature human myeloid cells , i.e. adult CD34+ bone marrow cells , was composed of Stat3beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This investigation was undertaken to determine the composition of StatG in mature normal human myeloid cells , i.e. polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes ( PMN ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These studies revealed that the major protein in extracts of PMN activated by G-CSF to bind the high-affinity serum-inducible element ( hSIE ) is a 72-kDa protein that cross-reacts with Stat3 monoclonal antibody , which we have designated Stat3gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Stat3gamma is derived from Stat3alpha by limited proteolysis and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> the carboxyl-terminal portion of Stat3alpha</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Because this region of Stat3alpha is involved in transcriptional activation , our findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibility</cue> that Stat3gamma <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be transcriptionally inactive and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> compete with Stat3alpha for Stat3 binding sites in these terminally differentiated myeloid cells</scope></scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
