<sentence id="0">Fludarabine-induced immunosuppression is associated with inhibition of STAT1 signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Fludarabine is a nucleoside analog used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies that can induce severe and prolonged immunosuppression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although <scope type="spec" id="0"> it <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> be incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells</scope> , fludarabine is also a potent inhibitor of cells with a low growth fraction , thus it must have other mechanisms of action .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">STAT1 , which is activated in response to many lymphocyte-activating cytokines including the interferons , is essential for cell-mediated immunity , as the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of this protein</scope> is associated with prominent defects in the ability to control viral infections .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that fludarabine , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A</scope> , inhibits the cytokine-induced activation of STAT1 and STAT1-dependent gene transcription in normal resting or activated lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Fludarabine caused a specific depletion of STAT1 protein ( and mRNA ) but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> of other STATs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This loss of STAT1 was also seen in cells from patients treated with fludarabine in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Brief exposure to fludarabine led to a sustained loss of STAT1 , analogous to the prolonged period of immunosuppression induced by exposure to the drug in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , STAT1 <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a useful target in the development of new immunosuppressive and antineoplastic agents</scope> .</sentence>
