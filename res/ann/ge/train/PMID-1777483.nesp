<sentence id="0">Activity of the kappa B enhancer of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain in somatic cell hybrids is accompanied by the nuclear localization of NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The two nuclear proteins NF-kappa B ( consisting of subunits p50 and p65 ) and the DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappa B ( p50 ) by itself , also called KBF1 , are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the human T-cell line IARC 301.5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In order to define the roles of these two factors , which bind to the same kappa B enhancers , in transcription activation we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between IARC 301.5 and a murine myeloma .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Most hybrids express both KBF1 and NF-kappa B in their nuclei , but one hybrid expresses only KBF1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The kappa B enhancer of the gene encoding the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor alpha chain ( IL-2R alpha ) is functional only in the hybrids expressing nuclear NF-kappa B. These findings show that nuclear NF-kappa B is necessary to activate the kappa B enhancer , while KBF1 by itself is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> sufficient</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that KBF1 is a competitive inhibitor of NF-kappa B and discuss how <scope type="spec" id="2"> these factors <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be involved in the transient expression of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha genes during the immune response</scope></scope> .</sentence>
