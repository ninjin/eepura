<sentence id="0">Replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 in primary human T cells is dependent on the autocrine secretion of tumor necrosis factor through the control of nuclear factor-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha controls T-cell activation and is a major inducer of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication in chronically infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , we have investigated its role in primary cultures of HIV-infected human T lymphocytes by using neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies or TNF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Primary resting T lymphocytes produced TNF-alpha and supported HIV replication after T-cell receptor activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Addition of neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies drastically reduced p24 antigen release and prevented CD4+ cell depletion associated with infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Anti-TNF-alpha also prevented nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation , and a good correlation between this inhibition and inhibition of HIV replication was observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , supplementing the cultures with high doses of IL-2 reverted anti-TNF-alpha inhibition of cell proliferation but did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affect the inhibition of HIV p24 antigen release or NF-kappa B activation in the same cultures</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , anti-TNF-alpha inhibited HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription of a reporter gene in primary T cells in response to activation , either in the presence or the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of HIV-1 Tat</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results support an important role for autocrine TNF-alpha secretion in controlling HIV replication in primary T cells because of its ability to maintain NF-kappa B elevated in the nucleus of T cells .</sentence>
