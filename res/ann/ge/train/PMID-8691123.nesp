<sentence id="0">Activation protein 1-dependent transcriptional activation of interleukin 2 gene by Ca2+/calmodulin kinase type IV/Gr .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV/Gr is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> it mediates some of the Ca(2+)-dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR engagement</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that CaMKIV/Gr induces the transcription factor activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) alone or in synergy with T cell mitogens and with the p21ras oncoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">CaMKIV / Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c-fos but is independent of p21ras or calcineurin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">AP-1 is an integral component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) transcriptional complex , which is required for interleukin 2 gene expression in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrate that CaMKIV/Gr reconstitutes the capacity of the cytosolic component of NFAT to direct transcription from NFAT sites in non-T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV/Gr as a Ca(2+)-regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
