<sentence id="0">Runx3 and T-box proteins cooperate to establish the transcriptional program of effector CTLs</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of naive CD8+ T cells with antigen induces their differentiation into effector cytolytic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro , characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin ( Eomes ) , T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon ( IFN ) = = gamma = = expression , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , we demonstrate a critical role for the transcription factor Runx3 in CTL differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program : IFN-==gamma = = , perforin , and granzyme B. Our data point to the existence of an elaborate transcriptional network in which Runx3 initially induces and then cooperates with T-box transcription factors to regulate gene transcription in differentiating CTLs .</sentence>
