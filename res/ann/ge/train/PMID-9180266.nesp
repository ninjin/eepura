<sentence id="0">Transcriptional activity and constitutive nuclear localization of the ETS protein Elf-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific transcription factor that belongs to the ETS protein family .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It can bind to DNA target sequences within a variety of cytokine genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate that Elf-1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus which is dependent on the presence of amino acids 86-265 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis of Gal4-Elf-1 fusion proteins revealed that the N-terminal 86 amino acids of Elf-1 contain a transcriptional activation domain , the activity of which is attenuated by an internal repression domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , Elf-1 interacts specifically with the E74 target sequence and can stimulate transcription driven by the E74 site independent of mitogenic signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , Elf-1 is able to stimulate gene transcription which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be required for the development and activity of lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
