<sentence id="0">Regulation of human epsilon germline transcription : role of B-cell-specific activator protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Germline transcripts initiate from promoters upstream of the immunoglobulin switch region , and are necessary to target the appropriate switch region for recombination and switching .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Different cytokines activate transcription at the appropriate germline promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Because binding sites for B-cell-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) are located upstream of several switch regions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster , BSAP <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> play a role in the regulation of germline transcription and isotype switching</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> BSAP plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the epsilon germline promoter in human B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results showed that BSAP plays a role in both IL-4-dependent induction and CD40-mediated upregulation of human epsilon germline transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">BSAP is unique among the transcription factors that regulate epsilon germline expression , because it is B cell specific , and is at the merging point of two signalling pathways that are critical for IgE switching .</sentence>
