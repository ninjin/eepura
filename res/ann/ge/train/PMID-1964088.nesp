<sentence id="0">Suppression of signals required for activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B in cells constitutively expressing the HTLV-I Tax protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transient short-term expression of the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I ( HTLV-I ) leads to activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF-kappa B. Consistent with findings obtained with transient expression assays , we observed marked accumulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B in the nucleus of Namalwa B lymphoid cells , which constitutively express Tax .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="0">NF-kappa B activity was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of Tax in Jurkat T lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The ability of both mitogens and cytokines to activate NF-kappa B was also blocked in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing Tax .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , the activation of other mitogen-inducible transcription factors , such as Fos and Jun , was unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , depending on the cellular environment , the short- and long-term effects of Tax expression <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">can</cue> be quite different</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Consequently , one function of Tax in cells infected with HTLV-I <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> involve cell-type-specific suppression , as opposed to activation , of distinct signal pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The cells lines described here <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">should</cue> be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
