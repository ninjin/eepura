<sentence id="0">Bcl-2 protein inhibits bufalin-induced apoptosis through inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in human leukemia U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In a previous study , we demonstrated that bufalin , which is an active principle of Chinese medicine , chan'su , caused apoptosis in human leukemia U937 cells by anomalous activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) via the signaling pathway of Ras , Raf-1 , and MAPK kinase-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we report the effect of overexpression of bcl-2 in U937 cells on the signaling pathway of apoptosis that is induced by bufalin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">The</cue> results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> the apoptosis induced by bufalin in U937 cells was significantly inhibited by overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">No</cue> significant difference was detected in the activation of MAPK kinase-1 that is induced by bufalin in wild-type or Bcl-2-overexpressed U937 cells</scope> ; however , the activation of MAPK by bufalin was significantly attenuated in the cells overexpressing Bcl-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Bufalin treatment activated activator protein-1 transcriptional activity ; however , this activation was decreased to 40 % in bcl-2-overexpressed U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> Bcl-2 acts downstream of MAPK kinase-1 but upstream of MAPK</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that , in the signaling pathway of the apoptotic process induced by bufalin , the transcriptional activity of activator protein-1 <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be down-regulated through the inhibition of MAPK activity by Bcl-2</scope></scope> .</sentence>
