<sentence id="0">Itk , a T cell-specific tyrosine kinase , is required for CD2-mediated interleukin-2 promoter activation in the human T cell line Jurkat .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We investigated the functional role of Itk , a member of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Tec family , in T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Stimulation of either CD2 or T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 on Tcells by monoclonal antibody-mediated cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk , which was maximal as early as 1 min after stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The tyrosine kinase activity in the anti-Itk immunoprecipitate was significantly activated upon these stimulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter activity stimulated by cross-linking of CD2 , TCR/CD3 , and CD28 with antibodies was significantly reduced by transient expression of an Itk mutant <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> the kinase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The reduction paralleled a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous wild-type Itk. Stimulation of CD2 or TCR/CD3 induced activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , the binding site of which is included in the IL-2 gene promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The activation of NFAT was also impaired by expression of the Itk mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results demonstrate that Itk plays a role in IL-2 production , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating</cue> a critical involvement of Itk in the initial stage of T cell activation by mediating signals from the TCR/CD3 complex , CD2 , and CD28</scope> .</sentence>
