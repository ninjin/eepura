<sentence id="0">Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in vitro by a novel combination of anti-Tat single-chain intrabodies and NF-kappa B antagonists .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat , an early regulatory protein that is critical for viral gene expression and replication , transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) via its binding to the transactivation response element ( TAR ) and , along with other cellular factors , increases viral transcription initiation and elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tat also superactivates the HIV-1 promoter through a TAR-independent mechanism , including tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of NF-kappa B , and inhibitors of Tat and NF-kappa B cooperatively down-regulate this Tat-mediated LTR superactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy using two PKC ( NF-kappa B ) inhibitors , pentoxifylline ( PTX ) and Go-6976 , and a stably expressed anti-Tat single-chain intracellular antibody ( sFv intrabody ) was employed to obtain cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Treatment of cells with PTX and Go-6976 resulted in cooperative inhibition of both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression and HIV-1 replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , the combined use of anti-Tat sFv intrabodies and the two NF-kappa B inhibitors retained the virus in the latent state for as long as 45 days .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The combined treatment resulted in more durable inhibition of HIV-1 replication than was seen with the NF-kappa B inhibitors alone or the anti-Tat sFv intrabodies alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Together , these results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that in future clinical gene therapy trials , a combined pharmacologic and genetic strategy like the one reported here <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> improve the survival of transduced cells and prolong clinical benefit</scope></scope> .</sentence>
