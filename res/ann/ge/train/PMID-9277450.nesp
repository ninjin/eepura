<sentence id="0">Surfactant protein A activates NF-kappa B in the THP-1 monocytic cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The expression of many genes for which products are involved in inflammation is controlled by the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. Because surfactant protein ( SP ) A is involved in local host defense in the lung and alters immune cell function by modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as surface proteins involved in inflammation , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that SP-A exerts its action , at least in part , via activation of NF-kappa B. We used gel shift assays to determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> SP-A activated NF-kappa B in the THP-1 cell line , a human monocytic cell line</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Activation of NF-kappa B in THP-1 cells by SP-A doses as low as 1 microgram/ml occurred within 30 min of SP-A treatment , peaked at 60 min , and then declined .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This activation is inhibited <scope type="spec" id="2"> by known inhibitors of NF-kappa B <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> by simultaneous treatment of the cells with surfactant lipids</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , the NF-kappa B inhibitors blocked SP-A-dependent increases in tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a mechanism by which SP-A plays a role in the pathogenesis of some lung conditions and point to <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">potential</cue> therapeutic measures <scope type="spec" id="5"> that <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> be used to prevent SP-A induced inflammation in the lung</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
