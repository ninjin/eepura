<sentence id="0">Role of the X2 box in activated transcription from the DRA promoter in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We investigated the function of the evolutionary conserved X2 box in the promoter of the HLA-DRA gene from the human major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) in resting and activated B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">NF-X2 , which contains members of the AP-1/ATF/CREB families of transcription factors , interacts with the X2 box ( 5'-TGCGTCA-3 ' ) from positions -97 to -91 in the DRA promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In resting Raji cells , little to <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> binding to the X2 box was observed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In sharp contrast , in B cells treated with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) , strong interactions between the X2 box and NF-X2 containing c-Fos were observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">As determined by transient expression and RNA analyses , the activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) also increased rates of transcription from the wild-type DRA promoter but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> from a DRA promoter bearing clustered point mutations in the X2 box</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Since the co-expression with a dominant negative c-Fos abolished the responsiveness to TPA , we conclude that activated transcription of the DRA gene depends on interactions between the X2 box and NF-X2 , which contains c-Fos .</sentence>
