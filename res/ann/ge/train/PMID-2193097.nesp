<sentence id="0">Lipopolysaccharide is a potent monocyte/macrophage-specific stimulator of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) potently stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat ( HIV-1-LTR ) CAT constructs transfected into monocyte/macrophage-like cell lines but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> a T cell line</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="1"> This effect <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to be mediated through the induction of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that LPS induces a DNA binding activity indistinguishable from NF-kappa B in U937 and THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">LPS is also shown to dramatically increase HIV-1 production from a chronically infected monocyte/macrophage-like cloned cell line , U1 , which produces very low levels of HIV-1 at baseline .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The stimulation of viral production from this cell line occurs only if these cells are treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) before treatment with LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This stimulation of HIV-1 production is correlated with an increase in the level of HIV-1 RNA and and activation of NF-kappa B. LPS is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> able to induce HIV-1 production in a cloned T cell line</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The effect of LPS on HIV-1 replication occurs at picogram per milliliter concentrations and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be clinically significant in understanding the variability of the natural history of HIV-1 infection</scope> .</sentence>
