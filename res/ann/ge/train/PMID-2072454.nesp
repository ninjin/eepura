<sentence id="0">Contribution of NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding motifs to the replicative capacity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 : distinct patterns of viral growth are determined by T-cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Starting with a replication-incompetent molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , lacking all the NF-kappa B and Sp1 binding sites present in the native long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , proviruses containing reconstructed LTRs with individual or combinations of NF-kappa B and Sp1 elements were generated and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">evaluated for</cue> their capacity to produce virus progeny following transfection-cocultivation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Virus stocks obtained from these experiments exhibited a continuum of replicative capacities in different human T-cell types depending on which element(s) was present in the LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For example , in experiments involving proviral clones with LTRs containing one or two NF-kappa B elements ( and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> Sp1 binding sites</scope> ) , a hierarchy of cellular permissivity to virus replication ( peripheral blood lymphocytes = MT4 greater than H9 greater than CEM greater than Jurkat ) was observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Of note was the associated emergence of second-site LTR revertants which involved an alteration of the TATA box .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 LTR possesses functional redundancy which ensures virus replication in different T-cell types and is capable of changing depending on the particular combination of transcriptional factors present</scope> .</sentence>
