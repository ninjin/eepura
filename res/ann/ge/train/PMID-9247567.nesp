<sentence id="1">The transcription factor NF-kappa B controls the induction of numerous cytokine promoters during the activation of T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Inhibition of T cell activation by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 exerts a suppressive effect on the induction of these NF-kappa B-controlled cytokine promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show for human Jurkat T leukemia cells , as well as human and mouse primary T lymphocytes , that this inhibitory effect is accompanied by an impaired nuclear translocation of the Rel proteins c-Rel , RelA/p65 and NF-kappa B1/p50 , whereas the nuclear appearance of RelB remains unaffected .</sentence>
