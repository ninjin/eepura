<sentence id="0">Control of I kappa B-alpha proteolysis by site-specific , signal-induced phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">I kappa B-alpha inhibits transcription factor NF-kappa B by retaining it in the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Various stimuli , typically those associated with stress or pathogens , rapidly inactivate I kappa B-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This liberates NF-kappa B to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of genes important for the defense of the organism .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Activation of NF-kappa B correlates with phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha and requires the proteolysis of this inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When either serine-32 or serine-36 of I kappa B-alpha was mutated , the protein did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> undergo signal-induced phosphorylation or degradation</scope> , and <scope type="neg" id="1">NF-kappa B <cue type="neg" id="1">could not</cue> be activated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that phosphorylation at one or both of these residues is critical for activation of NF-kappa B.</scope></sentence>
