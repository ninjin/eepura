<sentence id="0">The peri-kappa B site mediates human immunodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer activation in monocytes but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) , like HIV-1 , causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer/promoter region of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Whereas activation of the HIV-1 enhancer following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis-acting elements : a single kappa B site , two purine-rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have now identified a novel cis-acting element within the HIV-2 enhancer , immediately upstream of the kappa B site , designated peri-kappa B. This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus , and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> T-cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This is the first description of an HIV-2 enhancer element which displays such monocyte specificity , and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> comparable enhancer element has been clearly defined for HIV-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">While a nuclear factor(s) from both peripheral blood monocytes and T cells binds the peri-kappa B site , electrophoretic mobility shift assays <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">either</cue> a different protein binds to this site in monocytes versus T cells or that the protein recognizing this enhancer element undergoes differential modification in monocytes and T cells</scope></scope> , thus supporting the transfection data .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Further , while specific constitutive binding to the peri-kappa B site is seen in monocytes , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Understanding the monocyte-specific function of the peri-kappa B factor <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> ultimately provide insight into the different role monocytes and T cells play in HIV pathogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
