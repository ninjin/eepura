<sentence id="0">In vivo inhibition of NF-kappa B in T-lineage cells leads to a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation and cytokine production and to increased cell apoptosis in response to mitogenic stimuli , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> to abnormal thymopoiesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To understand the role of NF-kappa B complexes in T cell development and activation , we have generated transgenic mice in which RelA and c-Rel complexes were selectively inhibited in the T-lineage cells by specific expression of a trans-dominant form of I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transgene expression did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect the thymic development</scope> , but led to lowered numbers of splenic T cells and to a dramatic decrease in the ex vivo proliferative response of splenic T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha expression demonstrated that the perturbation of the proliferation response was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> attributable to an abnormal expression of these genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , expression of IL-4 , IL-10 , and IFN-gamma was strongly inhibited in the transgenic T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The proliferative deficiency of the transgenic T cells was associated with an increased apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results point out the involvement of NF-kappa B/Rel family proteins in growth signaling pathways by <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">either</cue> regulating proteins involved in the IL-2 signaling or by functionally interfering with the cell cycle progression</scope> .</sentence>
