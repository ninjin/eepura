<sentence id="0">Decreased proteasome-mediated degradation in T cells from the elderly : A role in immune senescence .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Induction of NFkappaB is a highly regulated process requiring phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteasome-mediated degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor IkappaBalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Analyses of the regulation of IkappaBalpha in TNF-alpha-treated T lymphocytes from young and elderly donors revealed severely compromised degradation of IkappaBalpha in T cells from the elderly .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0">Examination of activation-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha did <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> demonstrate any significant age-related alterations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , examination of proteasome activity in these T cells using fluorogenic peptide assays revealed a significant age-related decline in chymotryptic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that a decline in proteasome activity results in a failure to fully degrade IkappaBalpha in the elderly</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This failure to degrade IkappaBalpha <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> underlie both the observed decrease in NFkappaB induction and the IL-2 receptor expression in TNF-treated T cells during aging</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , decreased proteasome-mediated degradation <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be central to immune dysfunction that accompanies aging</scope> .</sentence>
