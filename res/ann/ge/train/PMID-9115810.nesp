<sentence id="0">NF-kappa B-independent suppression of HIV expression by ascorbic acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ascorbic acid ( ascorbate or vitamin C ) has been shown to suppress the induction of HIV in latently infected T lymphocytic cells following stimulation with a tumor promoter ( PMA ) and inflammatory cytokine ( TNF-alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To assess <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> this inhibition was mediated via modulation of the cellular transcription factor , NF-kappa B</scope> , we carried out gel shift analysis on nuclear extracts prepared under different conditions of cell stimulation in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of ascorbate , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , or zidovudine ( AZT )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pretreatment of ACH-2 T cells by NAC followed by stimulation with PMA , TNF-alpha , or hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) resulted in strong suppression of NF-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">neither</cue> ascorbate <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">nor</cue> AZT affected NF-kappa B activity under all three induction conditions in the ACH-2 cell line</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Ascorbate and AZT also had <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> effect on NF-kappa B activation following TNF-alpha- or PMA-induced stimulation of U1 promonocytic cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="5">the molecular mechanism of HIV inhibition by ascorbate is <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> mediated via NF-kappa B inhibition</scope> , unlike that seen with other antioxidants</scope> .</sentence>
