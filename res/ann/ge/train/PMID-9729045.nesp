<sentence id="0">CD30 is a CD40-inducible molecule that negatively regulates CD40-mediated immunoglobulin class switching in non-antigen-selected human B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We used our monoclonal model of germinal center maturation , CL-01 B cells , to investigate the role of CD30 in human B cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CL-01 cells are IgM+ IgD+ CD30+ and switch to IgG , IgA , and IgE when exposed to CD40L and IL-4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Switching is hampered by CD30 coengagement , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> through interference with the CD40-mediated NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation of downstream C(H) genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The physiological relevance of this phenomenon is emphasized by similar CD30-mediated effects in naive B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expression of CD30 by these cells is induced by CD40L but is inhibited by B cell receptor coengagement and/or exposure to IL-6 and IL-12 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that CD30 critically regulates the CD40-mediated differentiation of non-antigen-selected human B cells</scope> .</sentence>
