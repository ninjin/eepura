<sentence id="2">Through systematic DNA footprinting of the TNF ( encoding tumour necrosis factor , TNF ) promoter region , we have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) that causes the helix-turn-helix transcription factor OCT-1 to bind to a novel region of complex protein-DNA interactions and alters gene expression in human monocytes .</sentence>
