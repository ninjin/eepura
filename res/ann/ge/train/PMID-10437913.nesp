<sentence id="0">Retinoblastoma protein expression leads to reduced Oct-1 DNA binding activity and enhances interleukin-8 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="neg" id="0">Tumor cell lines with a defective retinoblastoma gene are <cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to transcribe the HLA class II genes in response to IFN-gamma treatment</scope> , and reconstitution of functional Rb rescues IFN-gamma-induced class II gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the molecular mechanism of Rb rescue of the class II genes is <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have examined the effect of Rb expression on the activation of the promoter for HLA-DRA , the prototype class II gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Oct-1 , a POU domain transcription factor , was identified as a repressor of HLA-DRA promoter activity in the Rb-defective cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Rb expression led to phosphorylation of Oct-1 , thus relieving its repressive effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Oct-1 has also been shown to repress interleukin 8 promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with reduced levels of Oct-1 DNA binding activity in the Rb-transformed cell lines , interleukin 8 expression is higher in these cell lines .</sentence>
