<sentence id="0">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein down-regulates transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in human T cells in vitro after T-cell receptor stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) negative factor ( Nef ) has been shown to down-regulate the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To define the mechanism of action of the Nef protein , the signal transduction pathways <scope type="spec" id="0"> which <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be affected in T cells by constitutive expression of the nef gene were examined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Stimulation of T cells with tumor necrosis factor , interleukin-1 , or lipopolysaccharide resulted in the recruitment of transcriptional factors to a similar level <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether or</cue> not the cells expressed the nef gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">On the other hand , stimulation of T cells by mitogens or antibodies to the T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex resulted in the down-regulation of transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in cells expressing the nef gene compared with cells <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> expressing the nef gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Because the Nef protein does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affect the surface expression of the CD3-TCR complex</scope> , we conclude that the Nef protein down-regulates the transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in T cells in vitro through an effect on the TCR-dependent signal transduction pathway .</sentence>
