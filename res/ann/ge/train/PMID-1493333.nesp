<sentence id="0">I kappa B/MAD-3 masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-kappa B p65 and requires the transactivation domain to inhibit NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The active nuclear form of the NF-kappa B transcription factor complex is composed of two DNA binding subunits , NF-kappa B p65 and NF-kappa B p50 , both of which share extensive N-terminal sequence homology with the v-rel oncogene product .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The NF-kappa B p65 subunit provides the transactivation activity in this complex and serves as an intracellular receptor for a cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappa B , termed I kappa B. In contrast , NF-kappa B p50 alone fails to stimulate kappa B-directed transcription , and based on prior in vitro studies , <scope type="neg" id="0">is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> directly regulated by I kappa B. To investigate the molecular basis for the critical regulatory interaction between NF-kappa B and I kappa B/MAD-3 , a series of human NF-kappa B p65 mutants was identified that functionally segregated DNA binding , I kappa B-mediated inhibition , and I kappa B-induced nuclear exclusion of this transcription factor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Results from in vivo expression studies performed with these NF-kappa B p65 mutants revealed the following : 1 ) I kappa B/MAD-3 completely inhibits NF-kappa B p65-dependent transcriptional activation mediated through the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 kappa B enhancer in human T lymphocytes , 2 ) the binding of I kappa B/MAD-3 to NF-kappa B p65 is sufficient to retarget NF-kappa B p65 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , 3 ) selective deletion of the functional nuclear localization signal present in the Rel homology domain of NF-kappa B p65 disrupts its ability to engage I kappa B/MAD-3 , and 4 ) the unique C-terminus of NF-kappa B p65 attenuates its own nuclear localization and contains sequences that are required for I kappa B-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the nuclear localization signal and transactivation domain of NF-kappa B p65 constitute a bipartite system that is critically involved in the inhibitory function of I kappa B/MAD-3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Unexpectedly , our in vivo studies also demonstrate that I kappa B/MAD-3 binds directly to NF-kappa B p50 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This interaction is functional as it leads to retargeting of NF-kappa B p50 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> loss of DNA binding activity is observed</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">presumably</cue> reflecting the unique C-terminal domain that is distinct from that present in NF-kappa B p65</scope> .</sentence>
