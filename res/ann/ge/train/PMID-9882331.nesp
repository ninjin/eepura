<sentence id="0">Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein abrogates interleukin-2 dependence in a mouse T-cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Tax , the viral protein , is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be crucial in the development of the disease</scope> , since it transforms healthy T cells in vitro and induces tumors in transgenic animals .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We examined the effect of Tax activity on the growth of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent T-cell line CTLL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Stable expression of Tax in CTLL-2 transformed cell growth from being IL-2 dependent to IL-2 independent .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Tax stimulated transcription through NF-kappaB and the cyclic AMP-responsive element-like sequence in the HTLV-1 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The finding of Tax mutants segregating these two pathways <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that the NF-kappaB pathway was essential for IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2 cells while the CRE pathway was unnecessary</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , both pathways were necessary for another transformation-related activity ( colony formation in soft agar ) of CTLL-2/Tax .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results show that Tax has at least two distinct activities on T cells , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that Tax plays a crucial role in IL-2-independent T-cell transformation induced by HTLV-1 , in addition to its well-known IL-2-dependent cell transformation</scope> .</sentence>
