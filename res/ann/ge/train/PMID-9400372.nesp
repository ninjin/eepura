<sentence id="0">Molecular mechanisms of anoxia/reoxygenation-induced neutrophil adherence to cultured endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) determine the time course of neutrophil adhesion to monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) that were exposed to 60 minutes of anoxia followed by 30 to 600 minutes of reoxygenation and ( 2 ) define the mechanisms responsible for both the early ( minutes ) and late ( hours ) hyperadhesivity of postanoxic HUVECs to human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The results clearly demonstrate that anoxia/reoxygenation ( A/R ) leads to a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs , with peak responses occurring at 30 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) after reoxygenation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Oxypurinol and catalase inhibited phase-1 adhesion , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> a role for xanthine oxidase and H2O2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In comparison , platelet activating factor ( PAF ) contributed to both phases of neutrophil adhesion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) and anti-P-selectin antibodies ( monoclonal antibodies [ mAbs ] ) attenuated phase-1 neutrophil adhesion , consistent with roles for constitutively expressed ICAM-1 and enhanced surface expression of preformed P-selectin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Phase-2 neutrophil adhesion was attenuated by an anti-E-selectin mAb , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating</cue> a dominant role of this adhesion molecule in the late phase response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds-oligonucleotides containing the nuclear factor-kappa B or activator protein-1 cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated phase-2 response , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a role for de novo macromolecule synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Surface expression of ICAM-1 , P-selectin , and E-selectin on HUVECs correlated with the phase-1 and -2 neutrophil adhesion responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Collectively , these findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> A/R elicits a two-phase neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion response that involves transcription-independent and transcription-dependent surface expression of different endothelial cell adhesion molecules</scope> .</sentence>
