<sentence id="0">Interleukin 4 activates a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein which interacts with an interferon-gamma activation site-like sequence upstream of the I epsilon exon in a human B cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Evidence for the involvement of Janus kinase 3 and interleukin-4 Stat .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Germ line C transcripts can be induced by IL-4 in the human B cell line , BL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Utilizing a IFN-gamma activation site-like DNA sequence element located upstream of the I epsilon exon , we demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that IL-4 induced a binding activity in the cytosol and nucleus of BL-2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This factor was designated IL-4 NAF ( IL-4-induced nuclear-activating factors ) and was identified as a tyrosine phosphoprotein , which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus upon IL-4 treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Because these are the characteristics of a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein , we determined <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> antibodies to Stat proteins will interfere with gel mobility shift</scope> and found that antibodies to IL-4 Stat , also known as Stat6 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> antibodies to other Stat proteins</scope> , interfere with the formation of the IL-4 NAF complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Congruous with the involvement of a Stat protein , IL-4 induced robust Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) activity in BL-2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Cotransfection of JAK3 with IL-4 Stat into COS-7 cells produced an intracellular activity which bound the same IFN-gamma activation site-like sequence and comigrated with IL-4 NAF in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results show that IL-4 NAF is IL-4 Stat , which is activated by JAK3 in response to IL-4 receptor engagement .</sentence>
