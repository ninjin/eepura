<sentence id="0">Octamer independent activation of transcription from the kappa immunoglobulin germline promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previous analyses of immunoglobulin V region promoters has led to the discovery of a common octamer motif which is functionally important in the tissue-specific and developmentally regulated transcriptional activation of immunoglobulin genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The germline promoters ( Ko ) located upstream of the J region gene segments of the kappa locus also contain an octamer motif ( containing a single base pair mutation and referred to as the variant octamer ) which has been shown previously to bind Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To further elucidate the role of this variant octamer motif in the regulation of germline transcription from the unrearranged kappa locus , we have quantitated the relative binding affinity of Oct-1 and Oct-2 for the variant octamer motif and determined the functional role of this octamer motif in transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We find that , although the variant octamer motif binds Oct-1 and Oct-2 in vitro with 5-fold lower affinity than the consensus octamer motif , mutation of the variant octamer motif to either a consensus octamer or non-octamer motif has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on transcriptional activation from the germline promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also find significant differences in activation of germline and V region promoters by kappa enhancers .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the germline promoters and V region promoters differ in their dependence on octamer for activation and respond differently to enhancer activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These findings have important implications in regulation of germline transcription as well as concomitant activation of the V-J recombination of the kappa light chain locus .</sentence>
