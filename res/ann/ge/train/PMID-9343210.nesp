<sentence id="0">Transcriptional activation of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 gene in T lymphocytes expressing human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recruitment and extravasation of T cells through the blood-brain barrier are favored by adhesion molecule-mediated interactions of circulating T cells with endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Since a common pathological finding in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated diseases is the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes into various organs , we have looked for the profile of adhesion molecules expressed by HTLV-1-transformed T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Flow cytometry analysis <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> these cells were expressing high levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1 [ CD106 ] ) , a 110-kDa member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily , first identified on endothelial cells stimulated with inflammatory cytokines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This adhesion molecule was also expressed by T cells obtained from one patient with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> by activated T cells isolated from one normal blood donor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The role of the viral trans-activator Tax protein in the induction of VCAM-1 was first indicated by the detection of this adhesion molecule on Jurkat T-cell clones stably expressing the tax gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The effect of Tax on VCAM-1 gene transcription was next confirmed in JPX-9 cells , a subclone of Jurkat cells , carrying the tax sequences under the control of an inducible promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , deletion and mutation analyses of the VCAM-1 promoter performed with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that Tax was trans activating the VCAM-1 promoter via two NF-kappaB sites present at bp -72 and -57 in the VCAM-1 gene promoter , with both of them being required for the Tax-induced expression of this adhesion molecule .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the nuclear translocation of proteins specifically bound to these two NF-kappaB motifs , confirming that VCAM-1 was induced on Tax-expressing cells in a kappaB-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Collectively , these results therefore <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the exclusive Tax-induced expression of VCAM-1 on T cells <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> represent a pivotal event in the progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases</scope></scope> .</sentence>
