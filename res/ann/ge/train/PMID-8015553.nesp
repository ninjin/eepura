<sentence id="0">Nonpituitary human prolactin gene transcription is independent of Pit-1 and differentially controlled in lymphocytes and in endometrial stroma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression of the human PRL ( hPRL ) gene in extrapituitary sites such as the uterus ( decidualized endometrial stroma and myometrium ) and cells of the hematopoietic lineage is directed by an alternative promoter which is located approximately 6 kilobases ( kb ) upstream of the pituitary-specific start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In order to delineate the tissue-specific mechanisms governing the control of nonpituitary PRL gene expression , we have cloned and sequenced 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA of the upstream decidual/lymphoid ( dPRL ) promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Based on sequence homology we identified two binding motifs for Pit-1 and seven half-sites for glucocorticoid receptor/progesterone receptor ( PR ) binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We focused our studies on the role of Pit-1 and of PR as <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> transcriptional regulators</scope> , since the POU domain protein Pit-1 is essential in the control of pituitary PRL expression , and progesterone induces decidual transformation of the endometrial stroma , a differentiation process during which the decidual PRL gene is activated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrate in a variety of cell types , including lymphocytes and endometrial stroma , that Pit-1 is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> involved in the regulation of dPRL promoter/reporter gene constructs carrying 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our experiments also show that activated PR does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> confer direct transcriptional control on the dPRL promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">When we compared the activity of the transfected dPRL promoter in PRL-secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells , we found that the 3 kb 5'-flanking region of the dPRL promoter did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> contain elements restricting expression to only those lymphocytes that produce PRL</scope> but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous PRL gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5'-flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the dPRL promoter in decidualized endometrial stromal cells actively secreting PRL , but did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> allow transcription in undifferentiated non-PRL-secreting endometrial stromal cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP , in the <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">absence</cue> of progesterone</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggesting</cue> that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual PRL gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
