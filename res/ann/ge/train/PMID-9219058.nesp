<sentence id="0">Association between expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 in adult T-cell leukemia cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It is known that the expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) in adult T cell leukemia(ATL) cells are high , whereas those in T-lymphoid cells are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In order to investigate the factors that influence the induction of ICAM-1 molecules , Northern blot analysis to measure the expression level of ICAM-1 mRNAs and Southern blot hybridization to analyze the integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) provirus were done .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The levels of ICAM-1 mRNA expression of ATL cells were generally higher than those of T-lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , ILT-mat cells and ATL16T(-) cells , although they were ATL cells , showed rather low surface ICAM-1 expression and ICAM-1 mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Southern blot hybridization showed that only two and four bands were found in ILT-mat and ATL16T(-) cells , respectively , whereas > 10 bands were detected in other ATL cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus to the genome of T cell , especially the number of integration sites , is one of the factors for induction of ICAM-1 molecules</scope> .</sentence>
