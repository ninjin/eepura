<sentence id="0">Multiple prolactin-responsive elements mediate G1 and S phase expression of the interferon regulatory factor-1 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) gene is both an immediate-early G1 phase gene and an S phase gene inducible by PRL in rat Nb2 T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To understand the mechanism by which PRL regulates the biphasic expression of IRF-1 , we cloned the rat IRF-1 gene and functionally characterized the IRF-1 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Upon transfection into Nb2 T cells , 1.7 kilobases ( kb ) of IRF-1 5'-flanking DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene mediated a 30-fold induction of CAT enzyme activity in response to 24 h of PRL stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Deletion mutants containing 1.3 , 0.6 , and 0.2 kb 5'-flanking DNA were incrementally less transcriptionally active , although 0.2 kb still mediated a 12-fold induction by PRL .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The sequence between -1.7 and -0.2 kb linked to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to respond to PRL stimulation</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that the activity of upstream PRL response elements <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> require an interaction with promoter-proximal elements</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By assaying CAT enzyme activity across a 24-h PRL induction time course , we were able to assign G1 vs. S phase PRL responses of the IRF-1 gene to different regions of the IRF-1 5'-flanking and promoter DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The 0.2-kb IRF-CAT construct was induced by PRL stimulation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , the 1.7-kb IRF-CAT construct was inducible by PRL during both G1 and S phase of the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Hence , <scope type="spec" id="3"> the PRL-induced biphasic expression of the IRF-1 gene <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to be controlled by separate PRL-responsive elements</scope> : elements in the first 0.2 kb of the IRF-1 promoter region act during early activation , and elements between 0.2 and 1.7 kb act in concert with the proximal 0.2-kb region during S phase progression .</sentence>
