<sentence id="0">Estrogen receptor diminishes DNA-binding activities of chicken GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The estrogen receptor ( ER ) repressed erythroid differentiation and erythroid-specific gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we investigated the effect of ER alpha ( referred to throughout as ER ) on DNA-binding activities of transcription factors involved in regulating the expression of erythroid-specific genes , and , in particular , the histone H5 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we found that in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate , human ER reduced the binding activities of chicken immature erythrocyte nuclear extracted proteins to GATA and CACCC sites in the H5 promoter and enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="0">the binding activities of NF1 and Sp1 were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affected by ER</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Binding of ER to an estrogen response element was enhanced by addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This lysate was also necessary for ER to diminish the DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that additional factor(s) are necessary for full ER function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Both GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins are critical for the developmentally regulated expression of erythroid-specific genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesize</cue> that interference in DNA-binding activities of GATA-1 and CACCC-binding proteins is the mechanism by which the ER inhibits regulation of these genes</scope> .</sentence>
