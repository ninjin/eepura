<sentence id="0">Expression of v-src in T cells correlates with nuclear expression of NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappa B is a rapidly inducible transcriptional activator that responds to a variety of signals and influences the expression of many genes involved in the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Protein tyrosine kinases transmit signals from cytokine and immune receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Very little information exists linking these two important classes of signaling molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We now demonstrate that v-src expression correlates with nuclear expression of a kappa B binding complex similar to that induced by phorbol ester and ionomycin , as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a variety of kappa B sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This complex was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor , herbimycin A. The v-src-induced complex comprised the p50 and p65 components of NF-kappa B , as determined by supershift and immunoblot analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As a functional correlate of this finding , transient co-transfection of HIV-1 LTR reporter constructs in a different T cell line demonstrated that v-src activated this promoter in a kappa B-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We found that transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR by v-src was more sensitive to mutations of the proximal , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> the distal , kappa B element</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The implications for T cell receptor signaling and HIV-1 gene expression are considered .</sentence>
