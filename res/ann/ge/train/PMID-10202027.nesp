<sentence id="0">Signal transduction pathways activated in endothelial cells following infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chlamydia pneumoniae is an important respiratory pathogen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recently , its presence has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we characterized C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of endothelial cells and demonstrated an enhanced expression of endothelial adhesion molecules followed by subsequent rolling , adhesion , and transmigration of leukocytes ( monocytes , granulocytes ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These effects were blocked by mAbs against endothelial and/or leukocyte adhesion molecules ( beta1 and beta2 integrins ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Additionally , activation of different signal transduction pathways in C. pneumoniae-infected endothelial cells was shown : protein tyrosine phosphorylation , up-regulation of phosphorylated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase , and NF-kappaB activation/translocation occurred within 10-15 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Increased mRNA and surface expression of E-selectin , ICAM-1 , and VCAM-1 were noted within hours .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , C. pneumoniae triggers a cascade of events that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> lead to endothelial activation , inflammation , and thrombosis , which in turn <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> result in <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> promote atherosclerosis</scope></scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
