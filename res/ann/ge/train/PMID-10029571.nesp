<sentence id="0">Interleukin-10 inhibits expression of both interferon alpha- and interferon gamma- induced genes by suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) helps maintain polarized T-helper cells in a T-helper lymphocyte 2 ( Th2 ) phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Part of this process involves the prevention of the development of Th1 cells , which are a primary source of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , a potent activator of monocytes and an inhibitor of Th2 proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Because monocytes and macrophages are important mediators of Th1-type responses , such as delayed-type hypersensitivity , we sought to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">if</cue> IL-10 could directly mediate inhibition of IFNgamma- and IFNalpha-induced gene expression in these cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Highly purified monocytes were incubated with IL-10 for 60 to 90 minutes before the addition of IFNgamma or IFNalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-10 preincubation resulted in the inhibition of gene expression for several IFN-induced genes , such as IP-10 , ISG54 , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The reduction in gene expression resulted from the ability of IL-10 to suppress IFN-induced assembly of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) factors to specific promoter motifs on IFNalpha- and IFNgamma-inducible genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This was accomplished by preventing the IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 , a component of both IFNalpha- and IFNgamma-induced DNA binding complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , IL-10 can directly inhibit STAT-dependent early response gene expression induced by both IFNalpha and IFNgamma in monocytes by suppressing the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> occur through the ability of IL-10 to induce expression of the gene , suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 ( SOCS3 )</scope> .</sentence>
