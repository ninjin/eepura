<sentence id="0">A novel genetic system to isolate a dominant negative effector on DNA-binding activity of Oct-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent studies have revealed that interactions between transcription factors play an important role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To isolate cDNA clones that dominantly inhibit the DNA-binding activity of Oct-2 , chosen as a representative factor , we have developed a novel screening system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This employs an Escherichia coli tester strain carrying a modified lac operon as a reporter gene , with the lac operator sequence replaced by an octamer sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Oct-2 expressed in this tester strain represses the expression of the reporter gene and changes the phenotype of the cell from Lac+to Lac- .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Introduction of a cDNA expression library prepared from a human T-cell line into the Oct-2-harboring tester strain allowed selection of three Lac+clones out of 1 x 10(5) transformants .</sentence>
