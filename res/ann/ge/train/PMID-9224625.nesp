<sentence id="0">Role of ascorbate in the activation of NF-kappaB by tumour necrosis factor-alpha in T-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The first product of ascorbate oxidation , the ascorbate free radical ( AFR ) , acts in biological systems mainly as an oxidant , and through its role in the plasma membrane redox system exerts different effects on the cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have investigated the role of ascorbate , AFR and dehydroascorbate ( DHA ) in the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor in Jurkat T-cells stimulated by tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show , by electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that ascorbate increases the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA in TNF-alpha-stimulated Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The ability of ascorbate to enhance cytoplasmic inhibitory IkBalpha protein degradation correlates completely with its capacity to induce NF-kappaB binding to DNA and to potentiate NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in TNF-alpha-stimulated Jurkat cells but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">AFR behaves like ascorbate , while DHA and ascorbate phosphate do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation</scope> .</sentence>
