<sentence id="0">Regulation of fas-ligand expression during activation-induced cell death in T lymphocytes via nuclear factor kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T cell receptor engagement activates transcription factors important for cytokine gene regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Additionally , this signaling pathway also leads to activation-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes that is dependent on FasL transcription and expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we demonstrate that nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many cytokine genes expressed in activated lymphocytes , also plays a role in T cell activation-induced FasL expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in a T cell hybridoma leads to decreased FasL expression and apoptosis upon T cell receptor stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We identified the NF-kappaB site in the FasL promoter that contributes to such regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Co-expression of p65 ( Rel A ) with the FasL promoter enhanced its activity , and co-expression of IkappaB dramatically inhibited the inducible promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="0">the transcription factor AP-1 is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for activation-induced FasL promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results define a role for NF-kappaB in mediating FasL expression during T cell activation .</sentence>
