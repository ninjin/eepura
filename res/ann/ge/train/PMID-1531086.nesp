<sentence id="0">A novel mitogen-inducible gene product related to p50/p105-NF-kappa B participates in transactivation through a kappa B site .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A Rel-related , mitogen-inducible , kappa B-binding protein has been cloned as an immediate-early activation gene of human peripheral blood T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The cDNA has an open reading frame of 900 amino acids capable of encoding a 97-kDa protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This protein is most similar to the 105-kDa precursor polypeptide of p50-NF-kappa B. Like the 105-kDa precursor , it contains an amino-terminal Rel-related domain of about 300 amino acids and a carboxy-terminal domain containing <scope type="spec" id="0"> six full cell cycle <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> ankyrin repeats</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In vitro-translated proteins , truncated downstream of the Rel domain and excluding the repeats , bind kappa B sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We refer to the kappa B-binding , truncated protein as p50B by analogy with p50-NF-kappa B and to the full-length protein as p97 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">p50B is able to form heteromeric kappa B-binding complexes with RelB , as well as with p65 and p50 , the two subunits of NF-kappa B. Transient-transfection experiments in embryonal carcinoma cells demonstrate a functional cooperation between p50B and <scope type="spec" id="1"> RelB <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> p65 in transactivation of a reporter plasmid dependent on a kappa B site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">imply</cue> the existence of a complex family of NF-kappa B-like transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
