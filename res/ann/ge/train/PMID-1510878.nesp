<sentence id="0">Mitogen stimulation of T-cells increases c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels , AP-1 binding and AP-1 transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have analysed the effect of mitogenic lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels as well as on activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding and enhancer activity in Jurkat T-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels were increased after Con A and PHA stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Since T-cell stimulation increases both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels and activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> involvement of these intracellular messengers in c-Fos and c-Jun induction</scope> was tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PMA , which directly activates PKC , mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun , but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The mitogen-induced increase of c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactivity was inhibited by H-7 , a kinase inhibitor with relatively high specificity for PKC , and less efficiently by H-8 , a structurally related kinase inhibitor less active on PKC , but more active on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Con A stimulation was found to increase both binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 consensus sequence , TRE , and AP-1 enhancer activity , in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">PMA was also found to increase the AP-1 enhancer activity , whereas elevation of Ca2+ or cAMP had only minor effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that stimulation with mitogenic lectins is sufficient to increase both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels , AP-1 binding and AP-1 enhancer activity in Jurkat cells and that they act via mechanisms that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> involve the activation of PKC</scope> .</sentence>
