<sentence id="0">HIV enhancer activity perpetuated by NF-kappa B induction on infection of monocytes [ see comments ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Permissiveness to replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) differs in T lymphocytes and macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In T cells , HIV transcription is poorly detected in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cloned , normal T lymphocytes show very little , if any , basal activity of the HIV enhancer and low nuclear expression of NF-kappa B , a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , fixed tissue macrophages express detectable HIV proteins , indicating permanent virus transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="0"> One explanation for the perpetuation of virus infection in macrophages <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> be sustained nuclear NF-kappa B expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , the U937 monocytic cell line , which is fully permissive to HIV replication , is known to express only low levels of nuclear NF-kappa B. We show here that chronic HIV infection results in both induction of a nuclear factor with antigenic properties indistinguishable from those of NF-kappa B and permanently increased HIV enhancer activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This phenomenon , which is independent of tumour necrosis factor , is associated with HIV replication , and <scope type="spec" id="1"> is thus <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to explain at least in part the perpetuation of HIV infection in monocytes</scope> .</sentence>
