<sentence id="0">Inhibition of transcription factor Stat1 activity in mononuclear cell cultures and T cells by the cyclic AMP signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of T cells results in a cascade of gene activation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into effector phenotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The regulation of transcription factors belonging to the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family was analyzed in PHA-activated mononuclear cells and in purified T cells activated by cross-linking cell surface CD3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cell activation resulted in a delayed induction of STAT DNA-binding activity , which was sustained for several days , was composed predominantly of Stat1 and Stat3 , and was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. Increased Stat1 and Stat3 mRNA and protein levels were detected , respectively 4 and 24 h after activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Stimulation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway , which skews cytokine production toward a Th2 pattern , resulted in the preferential suppression of Stat1 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">cAMP inhibited the induction of expression of IL-2 receptor components , but did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> inhibit IL-4 receptor alpha-chain and CD69 expression or the induction of activator protein 1 transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">cAMP signaling inhibited Stat1 at several different levels , including suppression of DNA binding and down-regulation of Stat1 protein and mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results demonstrate the regulation of STAT activity by a signaling pathway that regulates the T cell functional phenotype and is distinct from the cytokine-activated Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway .</sentence>
