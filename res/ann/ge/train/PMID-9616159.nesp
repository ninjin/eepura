<sentence id="0">Inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB activation attenuates apoptosis resistance in lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Death-inducing ligands ( DILs ) such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) or the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin have been shown to activate a nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB)-dependent program that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> rescue cells from apoptosis induction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate here that TRAIL ( TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ) , a recently identified DIL , also activates NFkappaB in lymphoid cell lines in a kinetic similar to TNFalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">NFkappaB activity is independent from FADD , caspases , and apoptosis induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To study the influence of NFkappaB activity on apoptosis mediated by TRAIL , CD95 , TNFalpha , or doxorubicin , NFkappaB activation was inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal or transient overexpression of mutant IkappaBalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sensitivity for induction of apoptosis was markedly increased by these treatments in apoptosis sensitive cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , both in cell lines and in primary leukemia cells that are resistant towards induction of apoptosis by DILs and doxorubicin , antagonization of NFkappaB activity partially restored apoptosis sensitivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that inhibition of NFkappaB activation <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> provide a molecular approach to increase apoptosis sensitivity in anticancer treatment</scope></scope> .</sentence>
