<sentence id="0">Thapsigargin induces IL-2 receptor alpha-chain in human peripheral and Jurkat T cells via a protein kinase C-independent mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Thapsigargin ( TG ) , an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase , depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores and induces a sustained Ca2+ influx <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> altering phosphatidyl inositol levels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">TG plus phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> TG alone</scope> induced IL-2 in Jurkat T cells , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that TG had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect on protein kinase C ( PKC )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , TG induced increases in IL-2R alpha protein as well as IL-2R alpha mRNA in Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A similar increase in IL-2R alpha by TG was also observed in human peripheral T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , like PMA , TG markedly induced NF kappa B in Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , TG and PMA exhibited a synergistic action on IL-2R alpha expression , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that TG and PMA induce IL-2R alpha through distinct pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">PMA- but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> TG-induced IL-2R alpha</scope> is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor H7 , whereas TG- but <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> PMA-induced IL-2R alpha</scope> was inhibited by cholera toxin , forskolin and 1,9-dideoxy forskolin .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In toto , these results <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggest</cue> that TG induces IL-2R alpha in human T cells through a PKC-independent pathway</scope> .</sentence>
