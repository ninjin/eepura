<sentence id="0">Transcriptional control of steroid-regulated apoptosis in murine thymoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Early studies in murine T cell lines <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> transcriptional transactivation functions encoded in the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) N-terminal domain are required for glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , more recent studies in human T cell lines have <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that the N-terminal domain is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> necessary for steroid-regulated apoptosis</scope> and that GR-mediated transrepression <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be the more critical mechanism</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To better understand the contribution of the GR N-terminal transactivation domain in mediating murine thymocyte apoptosis , we stably transfected GR , GR variants , and the androgen receptor ( AR ) into receptor-negative S49 murine thymoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">GR expression levels were shown to be rate-limiting for initiating the apoptotic pathway , and a positive correlation between steroid sensitivity and GR-mediated induction of an integrated mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) LTR reporter gene was observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Analysis of GR chimeric receptors containing the potent VP16 and E1A viral transactivation domains in place of the GR N terminus revealed that even low level expression of these receptors resulted in both enhanced steroid sensitivity and MMTV induction , thus supporting a role for transactivation in apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , we found that AR can initiate apoptosis in S49 cells after treatment with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone , despite its relative inability to induce high level expression of MMTV .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To investigate this further , we examined the steroid-regulated expression of an endogenous thymocyte-specific gene called GIG18 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We found that GIG18 was rapidly induced to comparable levels by both AR and GR , demonstrating that AR can indeed function as a transcriptional activator in S49 cells and , moreover , that GIG18 induction <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a marker of early apoptotic events in steroid-treated cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , these results support our <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">conclusion</cue> that transcriptional transactivation is a necessary signaling component of S49 cell apoptosis</scope> , although an additional role for GR-mediated transrepression cannot be excluded .</sentence>
