<sentence id="0">Identification of transcriptional suppressor proteins that bind to the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Two different proteins which independently bound to neighboring sequences within the negative regulatory element ( NRE ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) were detected in the nuclear extract of a virus-infected human T cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One of the factors bound to a novel dyad symmetrical sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This sequence is well conserved in various HIV-1 isolates and partial homology was found with the promoter region of the human retinoblastoma gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Similar DNA binding activity was detected in a variety of virus-uninfected human T cell lines and HeLa cells by means of a gel mobility shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The other factor bound to a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> AP-1 recognition sequence</scope> predicted for the HIV-1 NRE .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , this factor did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> bind to a typical AP-1 site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The insertion of multiple copies of the binding site for the former or latter factor into a heterologous promoter reduced the promoter activity to one-tenth or one-third , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , each factor <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> function as a novel negative regulator of transcription</scope> .</sentence>
