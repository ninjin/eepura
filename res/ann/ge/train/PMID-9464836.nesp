<sentence id="0">Induction of interleukin-12 p40 transcript by CD40 ligation via activation of nuclear factor-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-12 is produced in response to infection with bacteria or parasites or to bacterial constituents such as LPS in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells , and also generated by the interaction between activated T cells and antigen-presenting cells via CD40-CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">So far , transcriptional analyses of p40 have been carried out only using bacterial constituents such as LPS as stimuli .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study , we have characterized the transcriptional induction of p40 by CD40 ligation in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line , Daudi , and a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line , THP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These cells , stimulated by an agonistic monoclonal antibody against CD40 or by transfection with a CD40L expression vector , secreted p40 and showed enhanced p40 mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sequence analysis of the p40 promoter region identified two <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB binding sites conserved between mouse and human</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> NF-kappaB binding sequence which is located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 genes</scope> formed an NF-kappaB complex with nuclear extract from Daudi cells stimulated by CD40 ligation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , transfection of Daudi cells with the polymerized NF-kappaB binding sequence ligated to a thymidine kinase/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmid greatly induced CAT activity , but transfection with the polymerized mutated NF-kappaB binding sequence did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the NF-kappaB binding site located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 promoter regions <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">could</cue> be important for the p40 induction by CD40 ligation via activation of NF-kappaB</scope></scope> .</sentence>
