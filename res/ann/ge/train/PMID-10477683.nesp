<sentence id="0">c-Maf induces monocytic differentiation and apoptosis in bipotent myeloid progenitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcriptional mechanisms that drive colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage ( CFU-GM ) myeloid progenitors to differentiate into cells of either the granulocytic or monocytic lineage are not fully understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have shown that the c-Maf and c-Myb transcription factors physically interact in myeloid cells to form inhibitory complexes that hinder transactivation of c-Myb target genes through direct binding to Myb consensus sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These complexes arise in a developmentally regulated pattern , peaking at the promyelocyte stage , or in cell model systems , appearing soon after the induction of monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We wished to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">if</cue> this developmentally related interaction is a <scope type="spec" id="1"> consequence of myeloid differentiation <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> an intrinsic differentiating stimulus</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Because the elevated Myb:Maf status seen in differentiating cells can be recapitulated by overexpression of c-Maf in myeloid cell lines , we inducibly expressed the c-Maf cDNA in 2 bipotent human myeloid progenitor cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Elevated levels of c-Maf protein led to marked increases in Myb:Maf complexes and the accumulation of monocyte/macrophage cells , followed by eventual programmed cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Analysis of targets that could mediate these phenotypic changes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> c-Maf <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> plays a key role in myeloid cell development through dual mechanisms ; inhibition of a select set of c-Myb regulated targets , such as Bcl-2 and CD13/APN , coupled with the activation of as yet undefined differentiation-promoting genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
