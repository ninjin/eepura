<sentence id="0">Limited proteolysis for assaying ligand binding affinities of nuclear receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The binding of natural or synthetic ligands to nuclear receptors is the triggering event leading to gene transcription activation or repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Ligand binding to the ligand binding domain of these receptors induces conformational changes that are evidenced by an increased resistance of this domain to proteases .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In vitro labeled receptors were incubated with various synthetic or natural agonists or antagonists and submitted to trypsin digestion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Proteolysis products were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The amount of trypsin-resistant fragments was proportional to receptor occupancy by the ligand , and allowed the determination of dissociation constants ( kDa ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using the wild-type or mutated human retinoic acid receptor alpha as a model , kDa values determined by classical competition binding assays using tritiated ligands are in agreement with those measured by the proteolytic assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This method was successfully extended to human retinoic X receptor alpha , glucocorticoid receptor , and progesterone receptor , thus providing a basis for a new , faster assay to determine simultaneously the affinity and conformation of receptors when bound to a given ligand .</sentence>
