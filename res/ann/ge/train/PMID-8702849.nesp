<sentence id="0">Characterization of a new isoform of the NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) gene family member NFATc [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1996 Dec 27 ; 271(52):33705 ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The cyclosporin A (CsA)/FK506-sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) plays a key role in the inducible expression of cytokine genes in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non-T immune cells , the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins , we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform , NFATc.beta , of the NFAT gene family member NFATc ( designated here NFATc.alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The amino acid sequence of NFATc.beta differs from that of NFATc.alpha in the first NH2-terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two mRNA species of 2.7 and 4.5 kilobase pairs , while an NFATc.beta-specific probe detected only the 4.5-kilobase pair mRNA which was preferentially expressed in the spleen .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Transient expression of NFATc.beta was capable of activating an interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene in stimulated Jurkat cells in a CsA-sensitive manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , NFATc.beta <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">neither</cue> bound to the kappa3 element ( an NFAT-binding site ) in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">nor</cue> activated the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in cotransfection assays</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
