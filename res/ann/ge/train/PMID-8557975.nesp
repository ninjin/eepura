<sentence id="0">MEK1 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases are required for the stimulation of IL-2 gene transcription in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">TCR engagement stimulates the activation of the protein kinase Raf-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Active Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 ( MEK1 ) , which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinases/extracellular signal regulated kinases , ERK1 and ERK2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Raf-1 activity promotes IL-2 production in activated T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Therefore , we sought to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> MEK1 and ERK activities also stimulate IL-2 gene transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expression of constitutively active Raf-1 or MEK1 in Jurkat T cells enhanced the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA , and together with a calcium ionophore the expression of each protein was sufficient to stimulate NF-AT activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Expression of MEK1-interfering mutants inhibited the stimulation of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription and blocked the ability of constitutively active Ras and Raf-1 to costimulate NF-AT activity with a calcium ionophore .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Expression of the MAP kinase-specific phosphatase , MKP-1 , which blocks ERK activation , inhibited IL-2 promoter and NF-AT-driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA , and in addition , MKP-1 neutralized the transcriptional enhancement caused by active Raf-1 and MEK1 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway consisting of Raf-1 , MEK1 , and ERK1 and ERK2 functions in the stimulation IL-2 gene transcription in activated T lymphocytes .</sentence>
