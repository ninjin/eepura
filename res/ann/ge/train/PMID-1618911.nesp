<sentence id="0">Heterodimerization and transcriptional activation in vitro by NF-kappa B proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The NF-kappa B family of transcription proteins represents multiple DNA binding , rel related polypeptides that contribute to regulation of genes involved in immune responsiveness and inflammation , as well as activation of the HIV long terminal repeat .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study multiple NF-kappa B related polypeptides ranging from 85 to 45 kDa were <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">examined for</cue> their capacity to interact with the PRDII regulatory element of interferon beta</scope> and were shown to possess distinct intrinsic DNA binding affinities for this NF-kappa B site and form multiple DNA binding homo- and heterodimer complexes in co-renaturation experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Furthermore , using DNA templates containing two copies of the PRDII domain linked to the rabbit beta globin gene , the purified polypeptides specifically stimulated NF-kappa B dependent transcription in an in vitro reconstitution assay as heterodimers but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> as p50 homodimers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These experiments emphasize the role of NF-kappa B dimerization as a distinct level of transcriptional control that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> permit functional diversification of a limited number of regulatory proteins</scope> .</sentence>
