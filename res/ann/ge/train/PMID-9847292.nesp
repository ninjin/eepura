<sentence id="0">Interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta promoter polymorphisms in allergies and asthma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) and transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) are inhibitory for B and T cells , IgE production , and mast cell proliferation , and they induce apoptosis in eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These cytokines are therefore candidate genes which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> contribute to the development of asthma or allergies</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We investigated the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that polymorphic nucleotides within the IL-10 and TGF-beta gene promoters <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">would</cue> link to the expression of allergies and asthma</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DNA taken from families with an asthmatic proband was examined for base exchanges by single-stranded conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrated the presence of a polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene and four in the TGF-beta gene promoters ( 3 in TGF-beta1 and 1 in TGF-beta2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The IL-10 gene polymorphism was a C-to-A exchange 571 base pairs upstream from the translation start site and was present between consensus binding sequences for Sp1 and elevated total serum .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This polymorphism was associated with elevated total serum IgE in subjects heterozygotic or homozygotic for this base exchange ( p < 0.009 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The base exchange at -509 ( from the transcription initiation site ) in the TGF-beta promoter also linked to elevated total IgE ( p < 0.01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This polymorphism represented a C-to-T base exchange which induced a YY1 consensus sequence and is present in a region of the promoter associated with negative transcription regulation .</sentence>
