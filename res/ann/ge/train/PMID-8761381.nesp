<sentence id="0">Transcriptional analysis of Epstein-Barr virus gene expression in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma : unique viral latency in the tumour cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although case-oriented evidence for an association of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) with gastric carcinoma has been accumulating recently , the interaction(s) between EBV and gastric epithelial cells is/are largely unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we examined seven EBV-positive gastric carcinoma tissues for viral gene expression at the mRNA level , from which studies on the EBV oncogenicity in human epithelial cells will benefit .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that all seven EBV-positive tumour tissues constitutively expressed EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) 1 mRNA , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> EBNA2 mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The EBNA transcription was initiated from one of three EBNA promoters , Qp : by contrast , both Cp and Wp were silent , thus resulting in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of EBNA2 mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Latent membrane protein ( LMP ) 2A mRNA was detected in three of seven cases ; however , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">neither</cue> LMP1 <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">nor</cue> LMP2B mRNA was detected in any of the tumours tested</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transcripts from the BamHI-A region of the viral genome were detectable in all cases .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="4">BZLF1 mRNA and the product , an immediate-early gene for EBV replication , was <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> expressed in any of them</scope> , thereby <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that the tumour cells carried EBV genomes in a tightly latent form</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings further extended our previous data regarding EBV latency in gastric carcinoma cells at the protein level , and have affirmed that the programme of viral gene expression in the tumour more closely resembles ' latency I ' represented by Burkitt 's lymphoma than ' latency II ' represented by the majority of nasopharyngeal carcinomas .</sentence>
