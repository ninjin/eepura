<sentence id="0">A negative role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase in T-cell antigen receptor function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : A delicate balance between positive and negative regulatory mechanisms during T-cell activation determines the specificity and magnitude of an immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T-cell function , including the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , the costimulatory receptor CD28 , and negative regulators of T-cell activation such as CTLA-4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">PI 3-kinase is also regulated by the haematopoietic cytokines that determine T-cell differentiation and lymphocyte proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PI 3-kinase can thus dynamically influence the outcome of the immune reactions at various stages .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we investigated the importance of PI 3-kinase in TCR-directed T-cell activation using activated or inhibitory versions of PI 3-kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : <scope type="neg" id="0">Certain aspects of TCR responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of AP1 and serum response factor were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affected by expression of the mutant forms of PI 3-kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We found , however , that PI 3-kinase profoundly influenced the transactivation capacity of ' nuclear factor of activated T cells ' ( NF-AT ) elicited by the TCR : expression of an activated form of PI 3-kinase inhibited TCR-mediated NF-AT responses , whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase potently enhanced TCR-controlled NF-AT induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="neg" id="1">These effects of PI 3-kinase were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> mediated by previously identified PI 3-kinase effectors , such as protein kinase B , a positive regulator of PI 3-kinase , or the GTPase Rac</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> are therefore <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to involve a novel , as yet unknown , effector molecule</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSIONS : Our results establish that PI 3-kinase can both positively and negatively regulate T-cell function , and uncover a previously unrecognized function for PI 3-kinase in T cells as a selective negative regulator of TCR-signalling events and therefore as a determinant of T-cell homeostasis .</sentence>
