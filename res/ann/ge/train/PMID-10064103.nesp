<sentence id="0">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with diabetic nephropathy show increased activation of the oxidative-stress sensitive transcription factor NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Increased oxidative stress and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB has been linked to the development of late diabetic complications .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> oxidative stress dependent NF-kappaB activation is evident in patients with diabetic nephropathy</scope> we used an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay based semiquantitative detection system which enabled us to determine NF-kappaB activation in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We examined 33 patients with diabetes mellitus ( Type I and Type II ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Patients with diabetic nephropathy showed higher NF-kappaB binding activity in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and stronger immunohistological staining for activated NF-kappaBp65 than patients <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> renal complications</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NF-kappaB binding activity correlated with the degree of albuminuria ( r = 0.316 ) and with thrombomodulin plasma concentrations ( r = 0.33 ) , indicative for albuminuria associated endothelial dysfunction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In a 3 day intervention study in which 600 mg of the antioxidant thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) per day were given to nine patients with diabetic nephropathy oxidative stress in plasma samples was decreased by 48 % and NF-kappaB binding activity in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by 38 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In conclusion , activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with diabetes mellitus correlates with the degree of diabetic nephropathy .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">NF-kappaB activation is at least in part dependent on oxidative stress since thioctic acid ( alpha-lipoic acid ) reduced NF-kappaB binding activity .</sentence>
