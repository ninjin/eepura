<sentence id="0">IL-2 gene expression and NF-kappa B activation through CD28 requires reactive oxygen production by 5-lipoxygenase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for CD28-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B/CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Delineation of the CD28 signaling cascade was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity , followed by the activation of phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that lipoxygenase metabolites activate ROI formation which then induce IL-2 expression via NF-kappa B activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the CD28 costimulatory pathway</scope> .</sentence>
