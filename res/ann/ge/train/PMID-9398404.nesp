<sentence id="0">IL-2 and IL-7 induce heterodimerization of STAT5 isoforms in human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Despite differences in T cell responses induced by interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-7 , both cytokines modulate T cell functions by activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We examined the contribution of the two isoforms of STAT5 , STAT5A and STAT5B , to IL-2- and IL-7-induced activation of human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both cytokines induced assembly of STAT5A and STAT5B containing complexes capable of binding to the interferon-gamma activation sequence ( GAS ) , and these complexes rapidly translocated ( within 1 min ) into the nucleus of IL-2- or IL-7-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The kinetics of this translocation were delayed in IL-7-treated as compared to IL-2-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-2 and IL-7 were equivalent in their ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B and to facilitate binding of these STATs to an immobilized GAS element .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Both IL-2 and IL-7 induced substantial amounts of STAT5A/STAT5B heterodimerization .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , we observed constitutive association of STAT3 with each STAT5 isomer .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that IL-2 and IL-7 induce assembly of STAT heterodimers in a similar manner and that <scope type="spec" id="1"> subsequent cellular responses <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be driven by induction of similar sets of genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
