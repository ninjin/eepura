<sentence id="0">HIV type 1 protease activation of NF-kappa B within T lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappa B is a nuclear protein of the rel oncogene family capable of enhancing transcription of several cellular genes , including IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor , and viral genes transcribed from the HIV-1 LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has been reported that HIV-1 protease <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> cleave the NF-kappa B precursor to its active form in vitro</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study the effects of HIV protease on NF-kappa B precursor activation were examined in Jurkat T cells by introducing a protease expression vector into the cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Increased NF-kappa B activity was observed and this increased activity was blocked by a specific inhibitor of the viral protease .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Viral transcription , as measured using LTR-CAT assays , was only slightly enhanced in the HIV-protease expressing cells , while <scope type="neg" id="1">secretion of IL-2 and expression of the IL-2 receptor were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The limited activation of NF-kappa B by HIV protease appears <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">unlikely</cue> to have a significant effect on virus expression or T cell function</scope> .</sentence>
