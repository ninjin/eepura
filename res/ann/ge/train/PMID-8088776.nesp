<sentence id="0">Structure and expression of the human GATA3 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> GATA3 , a member of the GATA family that is abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage , is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to enhancers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To understand GATA3 gene regulation , we cloned the human gene and the 5' end of the mouse GATA3 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that the human GATA3 gene contains six exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The two human GATA3 zinc fingers are encoded by two separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> other structural homologies between these two genes can be found</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The human and mouse GATA3 transcription units start at a major initiation site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The promoter sequence analysis of these two genes revealed that they are embedded within a CpG island and share structural features often found in the promoters of housekeeping genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , we show that a DNA fragment containing the human GATA3 transcription unit , 3 kb upstream from the initiation site and 4 kb downstream from the polyadenylation site , displays T-cell specificity .</sentence>
