<sentence id="0">Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , a potent inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation , prevents apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We examined the effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , which potently blocks the activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , on the induction of apoptosis by a variety of agents .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Treatment of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line , HL-60 , with 10 micrograms/mL etoposide or 2 microM 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine induced NF-kappa B activation within 1 hr and subsequently caused apoptosis within 3-4 hr .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The simultaneous addition of 50-500 microM PDTC with these agents blocked NF-kappa B activation and completely abrogated both morphologically apoptotic changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation for up to 6 hr .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , PDTC <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to inhibit the endonuclease activity contained in the whole cell lysates</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The inhibitory effect of PDTC was also observed in etoposide- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in human thymocytes at a concentration of 1-10 microM .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Since PDTC has both antioxidant and metal-ion chelating activities , we tested the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) ( antioxidant ) or o-phenanthroline ( OP ) ( metal-ion chelator ) on the induction of apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pretreatment of HL-60 cells or thymocytes with 100-500 microM OP for 2 hr , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> 10-60 mM NAC</scope> , suppressed subsequent occurrence of apoptosis induced by etoposide .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the activation of NF-kappa B plays an important role in the apoptotic process of human hematopoietic cells</scope> .</sentence>
