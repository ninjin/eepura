<sentence id="0">Interleukin-10 Production by Th1 Cells Requires Interleukin-12-Induced STAT4 Transcription Factor and ERK MAP Kinase Activation by High Antigen Dose</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Summary</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CD4+ T====cells producing interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) and interferon-==gamma = = ( IFN-==gamma = = ) are reported in chronic infections .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the signals that direct the development of IL-10-producing T helper 1 ( Th1 ) cells are undefined .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T====cell receptor ( TCR ) ligation , sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation , and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Repeated TCR triggering led to enhanced IL-10 production by Th1 cells , and continued IL-12 action and high-dose TCR signaling were required for the development and maintenance of IL-10-producing Th1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although Th1 , Th2 , and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation , activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was====a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">IL-10 expression also correlated with c-maf expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Despite having distinct functions in protection against pathogens , all Th cells share the important task of controlling overexuberant immune responses by means of IL-10 production .</sentence>
