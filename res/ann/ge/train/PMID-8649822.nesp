<sentence id="0">Identification of a human LIM-Hox gene , hLH-2 , aberrantly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and located on 9q33-34.1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We describe the isolation of human LH-2 , a putative transcription factor containing two cysteine-rich regions ( LIM domains ) and a homeobox ( Hox ) DNA-binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">High levels of hLH-2 expression were observed in all cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia ( CML ) tested , regardless of disease status .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">hLH-2 was mapped to chromosome 9Q33-34.1 , in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the BCR-ABL chimera of the Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ' ) , the hallmark of CML ; hLH-2 was retained on the derivative 9 chromosome and is therefore centromeric of c-ABL .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The proximity of hLH-2 to the breakpoint on chromosome 9 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">raises the</cue> possibility of cis-activation by the t(9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) translocation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition to finding hLH-2 expression in all cases of CML , expression was observed in lymphoid malignancies and myeloid cell lines , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in primary cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="2"> The role of hLH-2 in the development or progression of leukaemia is <cue type="spec" id="2">not known</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , hLH-2 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> prove useful as a marker of CML for monitoring residual disease</scope> .</sentence>
