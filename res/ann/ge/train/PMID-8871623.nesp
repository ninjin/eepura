<sentence id="0">Induction of activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB by CD28 stimulation involves both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and acidic sphingomyelinase signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A major obstacle in understanding the signaling events that follow CD28 receptor ligation arises from the fact that CD28 acts as a costimulus to TCR engagement , making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of CD28 signals as distinct from those of the TCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To overcome this problem , we have exploited the observation that activated human T cell blasts can be stimulated via the CD28 surface molecule in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of antigenic challenge</scope> ; thus , we have been able to observe the response of normal T cells to CD28 activation in isolation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using this system , we observed that CD28 stimulation by B7-transfected CHO cells induced a proliferative response in T cells that was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> accompanied by measurable IL-2 production</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , subsequent analysis of transcription factor generation revealed that B7 stimulation induced both activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) complexes , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> NF-AT</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , engagement of the TCR by class II MHC/superantigen , either with or <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> CD28 ligation</scope> , resulted in the induction of NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-kappaB as well as IL-2 production .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using selective inhibitors , we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the CD28-mediated induction of AP-1 and NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This revealed that NF-kappaB generation was sensitive to chloroquine , an inhibitor of acidic sphingomyelinase , but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor , wortmannin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , AP-1 generation was inhibited by wortmannin and was also variably sensitive to chloroquine .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that in activated normal T cells , CD28-derived signals can stimulate proliferation at least in part via NF-kappaB and AP-1 generation , and that this response uses both acidic sphingomyelinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-linked pathways</scope> .</sentence>
