<sentence id="0">Monocyte arrest and transmigration on inflamed endothelium in shear flow is inhibited by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of IkappaB-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mobilization of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activates transcription of genes encoding endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines that contribute to monocyte infiltration critical in atherogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Inhibition of NF-kappaB has been achieved by pharmacological and genetic approaches ; however , <scope type="neg" id="0">monocyte interactions with activated endothelium in shear flow following gene transfer of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB-alpha have <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been studied</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that overexpression of IkappaB-alpha in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced degradation of IkappaB-alpha and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and E-selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) and growth-related activity-alpha ( GRO-alpha ) by TNF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This was associated with a reduction in endothelial MCP-1 secretion and GRO-alpha immobilization .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Adhesion assays under physiological shear flow conditions showed that firm arrest , spreading , and transmigration of monocytes on TNF-alpha-activated endothelium was markedly inhibited by IkappaB-alpha overexpression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inhibition with monoclonal antibodies and peptide antagonists inferred that this was due to reduced expression of Ig integrin ligand as well as of chemokines specifically involved in these events .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , rolling of monocytes was increased by IkappaB-alpha transfer and was partly mediated by P-selectin ; however , <scope type="spec" id="1"> it <cue type="spec" id="1">appeared</cue> to be unaffected by the inhibition of E-selectin induction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , our data provide novel evidence that selective modulation of NF-kappaB by adenoviral transfer of IkappaB-alpha impairs the expression of multiple endothelial gene products required for subsequent monocyte arrest and emigration in shear flow and thus for monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques .</sentence>
