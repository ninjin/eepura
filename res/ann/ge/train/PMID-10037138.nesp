<sentence id="0">Differential expression and phosphorylation of CTCF , a c-myc transcriptional regulator , during differentiation of human myeloid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CTCF is a transcriptional repressor of the c-myc gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although CTCF has been characterized in some detail , there is very little information about the regulation of CTCF activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Therefore we investigated CTCF expression and phosphorylation during induced differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that : ( i ) both CTCF mRNA and protein are down-regulated during terminal differentiation in most cell lines tested ; ( ii ) CTCF down-regulation is retarded and less pronounced than that of c-myc ; ( iii ) CTCF protein is differentially phosphorylated and the phosphorylation profiles depend on the differentiation pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We concluded that CTCF expression and activity is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels .</sentence>
