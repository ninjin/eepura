<sentence id="0">Phosphatidylinositides bind to plasma membrane CD14 and can prevent monocyte activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although bacterial lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) and several other microbial agonists can bind to mCD14 ( membrane CD14 ) , a cell-surface receptor found principally on monocytes and neutrophils , host-derived mCD14 ligands are poorly defined .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report here that phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) , phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate , and other phosphatidylinositides can bind to mCD14 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , another anionic glycerophospholipid , binds to mCD14 with lower apparent affinity than does PtdIns .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">LPS-binding protein , a lipid transfer protein found in serum , facilitates both PS- and PtdIns-mCD14 binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">PtdIns binding to mCD14 can be blocked by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies that inhibit LPS-mCD14 binding , and PtdIns can inhibit both LPS-mCD14 binding and LPS-induced responses in monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Serum-equilibrated PtdIns also binds to mCD14-expressing cells , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">raising the</cue> possibility that endogenous PtdIns <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> modulate cellular responses to LPS and other mCD14 ligands in vivo</scope></scope> .</sentence>
