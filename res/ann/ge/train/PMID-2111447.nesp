<sentence id="0">Involvement of a second lymphoid-specific enhancer element in the regulation of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer (OCTA)-nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( IgH ) gene</scope> , we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor , designated NF-microB , in the murine IgH enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate that the NF-microB-binding site plays a critical role in the IgH enhancer , because mutation of the microB DNA motif decreased transcriptional activity of the IgH enhancer in cells of the B-cell lineage but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in nonlymphoid cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the OCTA site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , combined mutation of both microB and OCTA sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , alteration of either the microB or E3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the IgH enhancer that <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacks</cue> the binding site for OCTA</scope> abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Nevertheless , a multimer of the microB motif alone showed <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> enhancer activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">DNase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a lymphoid-specific protein binds to the microB DNA motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the microB element is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the IgH gene but that interaction with another enhancer element is essential for its activity</scope> .</sentence>
