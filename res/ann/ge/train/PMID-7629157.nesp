<sentence id="0">Activation of NF-kappa B by phosphatase inhibitors involves the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha at phosphatase 2A-sensitive sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of NF-kappa B by various cellular stimuli involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor , I kappa B alpha , although <scope type="spec" id="0"> the underlying mechanism remains <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in the regulation of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation was investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations ( approximately 1-5 nM ) of calyculin A or okadaic acid , potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP-1 ) and type 2A ( PP-2A ) , induces the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha even in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of any cellular stimulus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="2">This action of the phosphatase inhibitors , which is associated with the activation of the RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer , is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A-treated cells , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> that from TNF-alpha-stimulated cells</scope> , is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF-kappa B inducers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF-alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> identical</scope> sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , these results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha , mediated through both the TNF-alpha-inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> serve to target I kappa B alpha for proteasome-mediated degradation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
