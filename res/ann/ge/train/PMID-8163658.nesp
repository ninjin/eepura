<sentence id="0">Hypoxic induction of interleukin-8 gene expression in human endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Because leukocyte-mediated tissue damage is an important component of the pathologic picture in ischemia/reperfusion , we have sought mechanisms by which PMNs are directed into hypoxic tissue .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Incubation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) in hypoxia , PO2 approximately 14-18 Torr , led to time-dependent release of IL-8 antigen into the conditioned medium ; this was accompanied by increased chemotactic activity for PMNs , blocked by antibody to IL-8 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Production of IL-8 by hypoxic ECs occurred concomitantly with both increased levels of IL-8 mRNA , based on polymerase chain reaction analysis , and increased IL-8 transcription , based on nuclear run-on assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Northern analysis of mRNA from hypoxic ECs also demonstrated increased levels of mRNA for macrophage chemotactic protein-1 , another member of the chemokine superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-8 gene induction was associated with the presence of increased binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic ECs for the NF-kB site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Studies with human umbilical vein segments exposed to hypoxia also demonstrated increased elaboration of IL-8 antigen compared with normoxic controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In mice exposed to hypoxia ( PO2 approximately 30-40 Torr ) , there was increased pulmonary leukostasis , as evidenced by increased myeloperoxidase activity in tissue homogenates .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In parallel , increased levels of transcripts for IP-10 , a murine homologue in the chemokine family related to IL-8 , were observed in hypoxic lung tissue .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , these data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that hypoxia constitutes a stimulus for leukocyte chemotaxis and tissue leukostasis</scope> .</sentence>
