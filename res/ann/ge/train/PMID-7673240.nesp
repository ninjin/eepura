<sentence id="1">Activation of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene after antigen recognition is a critical event for T cell proliferation and effector function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Prior studies have identified several transcription factors that contribute to the activity of the IL-2 promoter in stimulated T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we describe a novel regulatory element within the IL-2 promoter located immediately upstream of the nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This region ( termed the zinc finger protein binding region ( ZIP ) ) serves as binding site for two differently regulated zinc finger proteins : the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 and the inducible early growth response protein EGR-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In unstimulated cells which do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> secrete IL-2</scope> , only Sp1 binds to this region , while in stimulated IL-2 secreting cells the inducible EGR-1 protein recognizes this element .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In Jurkat T cells , the ZIP site serves as an activator for IL-2 gene expression , and a combination of ZIP and NFAT binding sites is required for maximal IL-2 promoter activity .</sentence>
