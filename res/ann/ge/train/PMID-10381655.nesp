<sentence id="0">NF-kappaB functions as both a proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulatory factor within a single cell type .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recently NF-kappaB has been shown to have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In T cell hybridomas , both T cell activators and glucocorticoids induce apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that blockade of NF-kappaB activity , using a dominant negative IkappaBalpha , has opposite effects on these two apoptotic signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Treatment with PMA plus ionomycin ( P/I ) results in the upregulation of Fas Ligand ( FasL ) and induction of apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity inhibits the P/I mediated induction of FasL mRNA and decreases the level of apoptosis in these cultures , thus establishing NF-kappaB as a proapoptotic factor in this context .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conversely , inhibition of NF-kappaB confers a tenfold increase in glucocorticoid mediated apoptosis , establishing that NF-kappaB also functions as an antiapoptotic factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that NF-kappaB is a context-dependent apoptosis regulator .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that NF-kappaB <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> function as an antiapoptotic factor in thymocytes while functioning as a proapoptotic factor in mature peripheral T cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
