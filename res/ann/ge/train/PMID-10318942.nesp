<sentence id="0">Defining therapeutic targets by using adenovirus : blocking NF-kappaB inhibits both inflammatory and destructive mechanisms in rheumatoid synovium but spares anti-inflammatory mediators .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The role of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis has long been a subject of controversy .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We used an adenoviral technique of blocking NF-kappaB through overexpression of the inhibitory subunit IkappaBalpha , which has the advantage that it can be used in the diseased tissue itself , with > 90 % of the synovial macrophages , fibroblasts , and T cells infected .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that the spontaneous production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines is NF-kappaB-dependent in rheumatoid synovial tissue , in contrast to the main anti-inflammatory mediators , like IL-10 and -11 , and the IL-1 receptor antagonist .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Of even more interest , IkappaBalpha overexpression inhibited the production of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 while <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affecting their tissue inhibitor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Blocking NF-kappaB in the rheumatoid joint thus has a very beneficial profile , reducing both the inflammatory response and the tissue destruction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The adenoviral technique described here has widespread applicability , allowing rapid testing of the effects of blocking a potential therapeutic target in either cultures of normal cells or in the diseased tissue itself .</sentence>
