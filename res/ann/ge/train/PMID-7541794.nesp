<sentence id="0">Integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and cytokine message induction in monocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> signaling role for the Syk tyrosine kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is an important aspect of signal transduction mediated by integrins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the human monocytic cell line THP-1 , either integrin-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin or ligation of beta 1 integrins with antibodies causes a rapid and intense tyrosine phosphorylation of two sets of proteins of about 65-75 and 120-125 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , integrin ligation leads to nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kappa B transcription factor , to activation of a reporter gene driven by a promoter containing NF-kappa B sites , and to increased levels of mRNAs for immediate-early genes , including the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A block both integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and increases in IL-1 beta message levels , indicating a causal relationship between the two events .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The components tyrosine phosphorylated subsequent to cell adhesion include paxillin , pp125FAK , and the SH2 domain containing tyrosine kinase Syk .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , integrin ligation with antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> of FAK or paxillin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In adhering cells , pre-treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> of Syk</scope> , while IL-1 beta message induction is unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> the Syk tyrosine kinase <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be an important component of an integrin signaling pathway in monocytic cells , leading to activation of NF-kappa B and to increased levels of cytokine messages</scope></scope> .</sentence>
