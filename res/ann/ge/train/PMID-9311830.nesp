<sentence id="0">The ability of BHRF1 to inhibit apoptosis is dependent on stimulus and cell type .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and Fas-mediated apoptosis of transformed or virus-infected cells <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be a critical component in the development of disease</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis , we used an expression cloning strategy and identified BHRF1 , an Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) early-lytic-cycle protein with distant homology to Bcl-2 , as an anti-apoptosis protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells conferred nearly complete resistance against both anti-Fas antibody and TNF-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , BHRF1 protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">failed</cue> to protect them from killing mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli was identical to that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway , cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3/CPP32 , but did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">putative</cue> function of BHRF1 in EBV-infected epithelial cells</scope> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be to protect virus-infected cells from TNF- and/or anti-Fas- induced cell death in order to maximize virus production</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Surprisingly , expression of <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">neither</cue> BHRF1 <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">nor</cue> Bcl-2 in a B-cell line , BJAB , protected the cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis</scope></scope> even though they increased the survival of serum-starved cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , the protective role of BHRF1 against apoptosis resembles that of Bcl-2 in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus .</sentence>
