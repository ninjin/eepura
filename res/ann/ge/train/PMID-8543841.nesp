<sentence id="0">IL-10 cooperates with TNF-alpha to activate HIV-1 from latently and acutely infected cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-10 is elevated in HIV-1-infected individuals and has been implicated in disease progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we investigated the effects of IL-10 on the activation of HIV-1 from infected monocytes and macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although IL-10 alone did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> induce HIV-1 replication</scope> , in the presence of TNF-alpha , IL-10 markedly enhanced virion production from a chronically infected promonocytic cell line ( U1 ) and in acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Neutralizing mAbs to IL-10 and TNF-alpha <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> both cytokines were essential for the induction and were required to generate a synergistic increase in virus expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The effects of the two cytokines were distinguishable functionally since pretreatment with TNF-alpha attenuated the cytokine cooperativity , while pretreatment with IL-10 potentiated their cooperativity , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that IL-10 and TNF-alpha play different roles in the activation of virus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Northern blot analysis as well as Ab blocking and cytokine secretion studies <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicated that</cue> <scope type="neg" id="3">the induction of either endogenous TNF-alpha or IL-10 was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> involved in the cooperativity , <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">nor</cue> was an up-regulation of TNF-alpha receptors</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In combination with TNF-alpha , IL-10 stimulated activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B binding activities and cooperated to increase HIV-1 steady-state mRNA levels and enhance long terminal repeat-directed transcription through activation of the NF-kappa B binding sites , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggesting</cue> the IL-10 effect occurs at least in part at the transcriptional level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicate that</cue> IL-10 , in addition to down-regulating the cellular immune response to HIV-1 , <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">may</cue> also play a role in TNF-alpha-mediated activation of HIV-1 replication in the monocyte/macrophage lineage</scope></scope> .</sentence>
