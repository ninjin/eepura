<sentence id="4">It is now demonstrated that HIV-1 proviral latency in the monocytic cell line U1 , in which only extremely low levels of HIV-1 expression are detected in the baseline unstimulated state , is associated with alterations in nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) moieties demonstrated in these cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in situ UV cross-linking studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A predominance of p50 NF-kappa B moieties and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibly</cue> p50 homodimers or closely related species</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> the p50-p56 heterodimer of NF-kappa B that is the predominant NF-kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells</scope> , is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells .</sentence>
