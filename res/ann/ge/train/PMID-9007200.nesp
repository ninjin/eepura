<sentence id="0">V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 suppresses interleukin 2-induced T cell growth [ published erratum appears in AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 1997 May 1 ; 13(7):633 ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We tested the effect of three linear or two loop peptides derived from the V3 region of the HTLV-III BH10 clone or the SF2 strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 on IL-2-driven T cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">V3-BH10 , which consists of 42 amino acids and has a loop structure , suppressed IL-2-driven proliferation of all IL-2-dependent cells [ Kit225 , ED-40515(+) , KT-3 , 7-day PHA-blasts , and fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells ] tested , whereas it did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> suppress the cell growth of IL-2-independent cell lines ( Hut102 , Molt-4 , and Jurkat )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This suppressive effect was also seen in IL-2-driven cell growth of CD8-positive lymphocytes purified from 7-day PHA-blasts , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> <scope type="neg" id="1">CD4 molecules were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> required for the suppression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The treatment with anti-V3 loop monoclonal antibody ( 902 antibody ) completely abolished the suppressive effect of V3-BH10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , V3-BH10 generated the arrest of Kit225 cells and also purified CD8-positive lymphocytes in G1 phase in the presence of IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">Neither</cue> chromatin condensation <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">nor</cue> DNA fragmentation was detected in Kit225 cells cultured with V3-BH10 and IL-2</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">V3-BH10 <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">neither</cue> blocked radiolabeled IL-2 binding to IL-2 receptors <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">nor</cue> affected tyrosyl phosphorylation of several cellular proteins ( p120 , p98 , p96 , p54 , and p38 ) , which is immediately induced by IL-2 stimulation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , V3-BH10 enhanced IL-2-induced mRNA expression of c-fos but <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> c-myc or junB</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="8"> the binding of V3 loop of gp120 to the cell surface molecule(s) <cue type="spec" id="8">appears</cue> to affect intracellular IL-2 signaling , which leads to the suppression of IL-2-induced T cell growth</scope> .</sentence>
