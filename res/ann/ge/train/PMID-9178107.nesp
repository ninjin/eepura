<sentence id="0">Reactive oxygen species and antioxidants in inflammatory diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">This paper aims to review the role of free radical-induced tissue damage and antioxidant defence mechanisms in inflammatory diseases that involve pathogenic processes similar to the periodontal diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">There is a clearly defined and substantial role for free radicals or reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in periodontitis , but little research has been performed in this area .</sentence>

<sentence id="5">Emphasis is placed on cytokines that have been studied in periodontitis , principally TNF-alpha , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 and beta-interferon .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The link between cellular production of such important mediators of inflammation and the antioxidant ( AO ) thiols , cysteine and reduced glutathione ( GSH ) , is discussed and it is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesised</cue> that NF-kappa B antagonists <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> offer important therapeutic benefits</scope></scope> .</sentence>
