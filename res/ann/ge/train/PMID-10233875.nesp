<sentence id="0">NF-kappaB activation is required for C5a-induced interleukin-8 gene expression in mononuclear cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">C5a , a potent peptide chemoattractant , stimulates interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Experiments were conducted to understand the mechanisms for C5a-induced IL-8 production , which was 14-fold greater than that in unstimulated cells by 2 hours .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IL-8 secretion was accompanied by accumulation of IL-8 mRNA in the cytosol and by nuclear expression of a kappaB DNA binding activity within 30 minutes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">AP-1 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> NF-IL-6 DNA binding activity</scope> was also detected in C5a-stimulated PBMC ; however , its delayed expression ( maximal at 4 hours ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> a less important role in the rapid production of IL-8</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The correlation between C5a-induced kappaB binding activity and IL-8 gene expression was examined in the RAW264.7 macrophage cells using reporter genes directed by the kappaB sequence from IkappaBalpha and IL-8 promoter regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">C5a-induced reporter gene expression was abolished by introducing mutations into the kappaB sites and by coexpression of a dominant negative IkappaBalpha construct resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pertussis toxin , which ADP-ribosylates the Gi proteins known to couple to the C5a receptor , produced minimal inhibition of C5a-induced IL-8 expression and had little effect on C5a-induced calcium mobilization in RAW264.7 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that NF-kappaB activation is required for C5a-induced IL-8 gene expression and that this response is mediated primarily through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway</scope> .</sentence>
