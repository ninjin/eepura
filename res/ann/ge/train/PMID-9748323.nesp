<sentence id="0">Activation of distinct transcription factors in neutrophils by bacterial LPS , interferon-gamma , and GM-CSF and the necessity to overcome the action of endogenous proteases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human neutrophils can be induced to actively transcribe a number of early-response genes , in particular those encoding cytokines , chemokines , and the high-affinity surface receptor for IgG , FcgammaRI .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although little is known to date about the regulation of gene transcription in neutrophils , several indications point to a role for distinct transcription factors , such as members of the NF-kappaB and STAT families .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> these transcription factors become activated under stimulatory conditions which are known to induce gene transcription in neutrophils</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Unexpectedly , we found that conventional procedures employed to prepare cellular extracts cause the release of proteolytic activities that are normally stored in intracellular granules , resulting in the degradation of various NF-kappaB/Rel and STAT proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To circumvent this problem , we developed an alternative procedure which allowed us to show that in neutrophils , LPS and TNFalpha induce a NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity which essentially consists of p50/RelA dimers , and that IFNgamma promotes the binding of STAT1 homodimers to the IFNgamma response region of the FcgammaRI promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , we report that neutrophil stimulation with GM-CSF results in the formation of a STAT5-containing DNA-binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Collectively , the current findings open new perspectives about mechanisms <scope type="spec" id="1"> that are <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to regulate gene transcription in neutrophils</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , the procedure described herein <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> prove useful in other cell types that express high levels of endogenous proteases</scope> .</sentence>
