<sentence id="0">OBF-1 , a novel B cell-specific coactivator that stimulates immunoglobulin promoter activity through association with octamer-binding proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent biochemical and genetic studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> in addition to the octamer-binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2 , other B cell components are required for lymphoid-restricted , octamer site-mediated immunoglobulin gene promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using a genetic screen in yeast , we have isolated B cell-derived cDNAs encoding Oct-binding factor 1 ( OBF-1 ) , a novel protein that specifically associates with Oct-1 and Oct-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Biochemical studies demonstrate that OBF-1 has <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> intrinsic DNA-binding activity</scope> and recognizes the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> those of Oct-4 and Oct-6</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The OBF-1 mRNA is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner , being most abundant in B cells and essentially <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absent</cue> in most of the other cells or tissues tested</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , expression of OBF-1 in HeLa cells selectively stimulates the activity of a natural immunoglobulin promoter in an octamer site-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , OBF-1 has all the properties expected for a B cell-specific transcriptional coactivator protein .</sentence>
