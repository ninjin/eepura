<sentence id="0">Sterol dependent LDL-receptor gene transcription in lymphocytes from normal and CML patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Sterol regulatory element ( SRE ) has been recognized to regulate various key genes coding for especially low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase and HMG-CoA synthase known to play a crucial role in the cholesterol feedback mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The deranged cholesterol feedback mechanism has been widely recognised in initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Consequently , the present study was addressed to understand this phenomenon and revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , this factor appeared when the CML patients achieved complete haematological remission ( CHR ) through alpha-interferon therapy .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , an inverse relationship was also observed between sterol modulated LDL-receptor gene transcription and the binding affinity of this 47 kDa factor to the SRE sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Based upon these results we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that alpha-interferon through its receptor initiates phosphatidic acid dependent signalling which in turn regulates the affinity of 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor as well as LDL-receptor gene transcription in lymphocytes from CML patients</scope> .</sentence>
