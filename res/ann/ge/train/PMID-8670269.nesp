<sentence id="0">An alternatively spliced isoform of the Spi-B transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Spi-B is an Ets transcription factor related to the oncoprotein Spi-1/PU.1 and highly expressed in B lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Ets proteins share a conserved Ets domain that mediates specific DNA binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Spi-B binds DNA sequences containing a core 5'-GGAA-3 ' and activates transcription through this motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Up to date , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the biological function of Spi-B remains <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we describe the characterization of an alternatively spliced variant of Spi-B , named deltaSpi-B , which has lost the Ets domain .</sentence>
