<sentence id="0">Differential induction of interferon (IFN)-inducible protein 10 following differentiation of a monocyte , macrophage cell lineage is related to the changes of nuclear proteins bound to IFN stimulus response element and kappaB sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We examined chemokine gene expression following the differentiation of a monocyte , macrophage cell lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The human monoblastic cell line , U937 was differentiated to macrophages by the treatment with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) , retinoic acid ( RA ) , or vitamin D3 ( VitD3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The gene expression of interferon (IFN)-inducible protein 10 ( IP-10 ) ( a CXC chemokine ) was markedly augmented by the IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells , but only marginally in undifferentiated or VitD3-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , another inducible gene expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( a CC chemokine ) and the activation of the transcriptional factor ( FcRFgamma ) bound to the gamma response region were similarly or less abundantly induced by IFNgamma treatment in PMA- or RA-differentiated U937 cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> increased IP-10 mRNA induction was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> due to the augmented ability of the cells to respond to the presence of IFNgamma</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Increased expression of IFNgamma-induced IP-10 mRNA following the differentiation of U937 cells was mediated largely by augmented transcriptional activity of the gene and was related to differentiation-dependent changes of the proteins bound to IFN stimulus response element ( ISRE ) and kB sites , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that these nuclear proteins <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> determine the IP-10 mRNA inducibility by IFNgamma</scope></scope> .</sentence>
