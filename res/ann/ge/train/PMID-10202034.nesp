<sentence id="0">Extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 , Jun N-terminal kinase , and c-Jun are involved in NF-kappa B-dependent IL-6 expression in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In the present study we investigated the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) in mediating IL-6 gene expression in human monocytes</scope> , in particular their role in enhancing NF-kappa B activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Freshly isolated monocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid secreted high levels of IL-6 protein , which coincided with enhanced binding activity of NF-kappa B as well as with phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The ERK pathway-specific inhibitor PD98059 inhibited IL-6 secretion from monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transient overexpression of inactive mutants of either Raf-1 or JNK1 showed that both pathways were involved in kappa B-dependent IL-6 promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By using PD98059 , we demonstrated that the Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect the DNA binding of NF-kappa B</scope> but , rather , acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B. Interestingly , it was shown that NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription , both in the context of the IL-6 promoter as well as on its own , was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c-Jun protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We conclude that okadaic acid-induced IL-6 gene expression is at least partly mediated through the ERK1/2 and JNK pathway-dependent activation of NF-kappa B transcriptional capacity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the JNK pathway <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> regulate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun</scope></scope> .</sentence>
