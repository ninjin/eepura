<sentence id="0">Signals transduced through the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes activate NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have demonstrated that native envelope glycoproteins of HIV-1 , gp160 can induce activation of the transcription factor , NF-kappa B. The stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the CD4 molecule , since pretreatment with soluble CD4 abrogates its activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The gp160-induced NF-kappa B complex consists of p65 , p50 and c-rel proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The stimulatory effect of gp160 on NF-kappa B activation is protein synthesis independent , is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and abrogated by inhibitors of protein kinase C .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The gp160-mediated activation of NF-kappa B in CD4 positive T cells <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be involved in biological effects , e.g. , enhanced HIV replication , hypergammaglobulinemia , increased cytokine secretion , hypercellularity in bone marrow and apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
