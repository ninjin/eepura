<sentence id="0">Involvement of Alu sequences in the cell-specific regulation of transcription of the gamma chain of Fc and T cell receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Fc epsilon RI-gamma chains are expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells where they play a critical role in signal transduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">They are part of the high affinity IgE receptor in mast cells , basophils , Langerhans cells , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> other cells</scope> ; a component of the low affinity receptor for IgG ( Fc gamma RIIIA or CD16 ) in natural killer cells and macrophages ; and part of the T cell antigen receptor in subsets of T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the gamma chain gene by analyzing the 2.5-kilobase sequence upstream of the transcription start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This sequence contains a promoter specific to cells of hematopoietic lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the tissue specificity of this promoter is only partial because it is active in all of the hematopoietic cells tested here , regardless of <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> they constitutively express Fc epsilon RI- gamma chain transcripts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have identified two adjacent cis-acting regulatory elements , both of which are part of an Alu repeat .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The first ( -445/-366 ) is a positive element active in both basophils and T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The second ( -365/-264 ) binds to nuclear factors , <scope type="spec" id="2"> which <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to be different in basophils and T cells</scope> , and acts as a negative element in basophils and as a positive one in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , this Alu repeat ( 90 % identical to Alu consensus sequences ) has evolved to become both a positive and negative regulator .</sentence>
