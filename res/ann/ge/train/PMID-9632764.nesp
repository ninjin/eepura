<sentence id="0">Coactivation by OCA-B : definition of critical regions and synergism with general cofactors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Molecular dissection of the B-cell-specific transcription coactivator OCA-B has revealed distinct regions important , respectively , for recruitment to immunoglobulin promoters through interaction with octamer-bound Oct-1 and for subsequent coactivator function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Further analysis of general coactivator requirements showed that selective removal of PC4 from the essential USA fraction severely impairs Oct-1 and OCA-B function in a cell-free system reconstituted with partially purified factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Full activity can be restored by the combined action of recombinant PC4 and the PC4-depleted USA fraction , thus <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> a joint requirement for PC4 and another , USA-derived component(s) for optimal function of Oct-1/OCA-B in the reconstituted system</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Indeed , USA-derived PC2 was found to act synergistically with PC4 in reproducing the function of intact USA in the assay system .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistent with the requirement for PC4 in the reconstituted system , OCA-B was found to interact directly with PC4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Surprisingly , however , removal of PC4 from the unfractionated nuclear extract has <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> detrimental effect on OCA-B/Oct-1-dependent transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results lead to a general model for the synergistic function of activation domains in Oct-1 and OCA-B ( mediated by the combined action of the multiple USA components ) and , further , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> a functional redundancy in general coactivators</scope> .</sentence>
