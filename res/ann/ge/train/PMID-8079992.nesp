<sentence id="0">The severe phenotype of females with tiny ring X chromosomes is associated with inability of these chromosomes to undergo X inactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mental retardation and a constellation of congenital malformations not usually associated with Turner syndrome are seen in some females with a mosaic 45 , X/46 , X , r(X) karyotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Studies of these females show that the XIST locus on their tiny ring X chromosomes is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">either</cue> not present or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> expressed</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As XIST transcription is well correlated with inactivation of the X chromosome in female somatic cells and spermatogonia , nonexpression of the locus even when it is present <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that these chromosomes are transcriptionally active</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We examined the transcriptional activity of ring X chromosomes lacking XIST expression (XISTE- ) , from three females with severe phenotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The two tiny ring X chromosomes studied with an antibody specific for the acetylated isoforms of histone H4 marking transcribed chromatin domains were labeled at a level consistent with their being active .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also examined tow of the XISTE- ring chromosomes to determine <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> genes that are normally silent on an inactive X are expressed from these chromosomes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Analyses of hybrid cells show that TIMP , ZXDA , and ZXDB loci on the proximal short arm , and AR and PHKA1 loci on the long arm , are well expressed from the tiny ring X chromosome lacking XIST DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Studies of the ring chromosome that has XIST DNA but does <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> transcribe it</scope> show that its AR allele is transcribed along with the one on the normal X allele .</sentence>
