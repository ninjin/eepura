<sentence id="0">Host defense mechanisms triggered by microbial lipoproteins through toll-like receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The generation of cell-mediated immunity against many infectious pathogens involves the production of interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , a key signal of the innate immune system .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Yet , for many pathogens , the molecules that induce IL-12 production by macrophages and the mechanisms by which they do so remain undefined .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here it is shown that microbial lipoproteins are potent stimulators of IL-12 production by human macrophages , and that induction is mediated by Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Several lipoproteins stimulated TLR-dependent transcription of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide , a powerful microbicidal pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activation of TLRs by microbial lipoproteins <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> initiate innate defense mechanisms against infectious pathogens</scope> .</sentence>
