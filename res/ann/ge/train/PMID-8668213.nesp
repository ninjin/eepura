<sentence id="0">Recombinant NFAT1 ( NFATp ) is regulated by calcineurin in T cells and mediates transcription of several cytokine genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factors of the NFAT family play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have identified two new isoforms of the transcription factor NFAT1 ( previously termed NFATp ) that are the predominant isoforms expressed in murine and human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">When expressed in Jurkat T cells , recombinant NFAT1 is regulated , as expected , by the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin , and its function is inhibited by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transactivation by recombinant NFAT1 in Jurkat T cells requires dual stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ; this activity is potentiated by coexpression of constitutively active calcineurin and is inhibited by CsA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Immunocytochemical analysis <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> recombinant NFAT1 localizes in the cytoplasm of transiently transfected T cells and translocates into the nucleus in a CsA-sensitive manner following ionomycin stimulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">When expressed in COS cells , however , NFAT1 is capable of transactivation , but <scope type="neg" id="1">it is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> regulated correctly</scope> : its subcellular localization and transcriptional function are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected by stimulation of the COS cells with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Recombinant NFAT1 can mediate transcription of the interleukin-2 , interleukin-4 , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoters in T cells , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that NFAT1 contributes to the CsA-sensitive transcription of these genes during the immune response</scope> .</sentence>
