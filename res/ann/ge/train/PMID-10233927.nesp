<sentence id="0">Control of cell cycle entry and apoptosis in B lymphocytes infected by Epstein-Barr virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Infection of human B cells with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) results in activation of the cell cycle and cell growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To interpret the mechanisms by which EBV activates the cell , we have assayed many proteins involved in control of the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle and regulation of apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In EBV infection most of the changes , including the early induction of cyclin D2 , are dependent on expression of EBV genes , but an alteration in the E2F-4 profile was partly independent of viral gene expression , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">presumably</cue> occurring in response to signal transduction activated when the virus binds to its receptor , CD21</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By comparing the expression of genes controlling apoptosis , including those encoding several members of the BCL-2 family of proteins , the known relative resistance of EBV-immortalized B-cell lines to apoptosis induced by low serum was found to correlate with expression of both BCL-2 and A20 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A20 can be regulated by the NF-kappaB transcription factor , which is known to be activated by the EBV LMP-1 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Quantitative assays demonstrated a direct temporal relationship between LMP-1 protein levels and active NF-kappaB during the time course of infection .</sentence>
