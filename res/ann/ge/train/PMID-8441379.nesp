<sentence id="2">A cell-type-independent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive enhancer element located between -3757 and -2729 bp upstream from the transcription start site ( cap site ) consisted of at least six discrete subregions which were essential to the maximal induction by LPS in transfected monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The enhancer also <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to mediate phorbol myristate acetate induction in monocytes and IL-1 responsiveness in fibroblasts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Deletion and base substitution mutations along with DNA binding studies demonstrated that the enhancer contained a minimum of three functional protein binding sequences , <scope type="spec" id="1"> two of which <cue type="spec" id="1">appeared</cue> to be important for gene induction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">One of the essential proteins which bound to the enhancer was <scope type="spec" id="2"> similar <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> identical</scope> to members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors required for both IL-1- and LPS-specific induction of the IL-6 gene ( i.e. , the NF-IL6 proteins ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">When ligated to the proIL-1 beta cap site-proximal region ( located between -131 to +12 ) , both the proIL-1 beta and the simian virus 40 enhancer elements functioned more efficiently in monocytes than in HeLa cells , which are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> normally competent for IL-1 beta expression</scope> .</sentence>
