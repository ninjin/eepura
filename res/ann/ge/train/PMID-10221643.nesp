<sentence id="0">Tcf-1-mediated transcription in T lymphocytes : differential role for glycogen synthase kinase-3 in fibroblasts and T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Beta-catenin is the vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene Armadillo and plays roles in both cell-cell adhesion and transduction of the Wnt signaling cascade .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recently , members of the Lef/Tcf transcription factor family have been identified as protein partners of beta-catenin , explaining how beta-catenin alters gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report that in T cells , Tcf-1 also becomes transcriptionally active through interaction with beta-catenin , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the Wnt signal transduction pathway is operational in T lymphocytes as well</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta ( GSK-3beta ) , resulting in increased levels of beta-catenin , we find <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> evidence for involvement of GSK-3beta in Tcf-mediated transcription in T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">That is , a dominant negative GSK-3beta does not specifically activate Tcf transcription and stimuli ( lithium or phytohemagglutinin ) that inhibit GSK-3beta activity also do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> activate Tcf reporter genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , inhibition of GSK-3beta is insufficient to activate Tcf-dependent transcription in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , in C57MG fibroblast cells , lithium inactivates GSK-3beta and induces Tcf-controlled transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This is the first demonstration that lithium can alter gene expression of Tcf-responsive genes , and points to a difference in regulation of Wnt signaling between fibroblasts and lymphocytes .</sentence>
