<sentence id="0">In vitro suppression of programmed cell death of B cells by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cellular pathways for induction of programmed cell death ( PCD ) have been identified , but little is known about specific extracellular matrix processes that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> affect apoptosis along those pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , a series of Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines were assayed for their expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> TIMP-1-positive BL lines show resistance to cold-shock-induced apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , recombinant TIMP-1 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> <scope type="spec" id="3"> TIMP-2 <cue type="spec" id="3">or</cue> a synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor ( BB-94 )</scope></scope> , confers resistance to apoptosis induced by both CD95-dependent and -independent ( cold shock , serum deprivation , and gamma-radiation ) pathways in TIMP-1-negative BL lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">TIMP-1 suppression of PCD is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> due to metalloproteinase inhibition</scope> , as reduction and alkylation of the TIMP-1 did <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> abolish this activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Retroviral induction of TIMP-1 not only resulted in cell survival but also in continued DNA synthesis for up to 5 d in the absence of serum , while controls underwent apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This resistance to apoptosis is reversed by anti-TIMP-1 antibodies , demonstrating that secreted TIMP-1 is active in blocking apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , TIMP-1 upregulation induced expression of Bcl-XL but <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> Bcl-2</scope> as well as decreased NF-kappaB activity as compared with controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results demonstrate that TIMP-1 suppresses apoptosis in B cells and <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggests</cue> a novel activity for TIMP-1 in tissue homeostasis</scope> .</sentence>
