<sentence id="1">The lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2a is implicated in B cell-specific transcriptional activity via the octamer motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Structure/function analysis of various Oct-2a effector regions in the context of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that Oct-2a contains two functionally different activation domains at the N and the C termini .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The transcriptional activity of both domains is strongly potentiated by interactions with distinct B cell-specific coactivators .</sentence>
