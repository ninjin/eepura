<sentence id="0">Inhibition of NF-AT-dependent transcription by NF-kappa B : implications for differential gene expression in T helper cell subsets .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of individual CD4+ T cells results in differential lymphokine expression : interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) is preferentially produced by T helper type 1 ( TH1 ) cells , which are involved in cell-mediated immune responses , whereas IL-4 is synthesized by TH2 cells , which are essential for humoral immunity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Ca(2+)-dependent factor NF-ATp plays a key role in the inducible transcription of both these lymphokine genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , while IL2 expression requires the contribution of Ca(2+)- and protein kinase C-dependent signals , we report that activation of human IL4 transcription through the Ca(2+)-dependent pathway is diminished by protein kinase C stimulation in Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This phenomenon is due to mutually exclusive binding of NF-ATp and NF-kappa B to the P sequence , an element located 69 bp upstream of the IL4 transcription initiation site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Human IL4 promoter-mediated transcription is downregulated in Jurkat cells stimulated with the NF-kappa B-activating cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha and suppressed in RelA-overexpressing cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , protein kinase C stimulation or RelA overexpression does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affect the activity of a human IL4 promoter containing a mouse P sequence , which is a higher-affinity site for NF-ATp and a lower-affinity site for RelA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , competition between two general transcriptional activators , RelA and NF-ATp , mediates the inhibitory effect of protein kinase C stimulation on IL4 expression and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> contribute to differential gene expression in TH cells</scope> .</sentence>
