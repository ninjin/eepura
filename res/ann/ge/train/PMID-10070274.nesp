<sentence id="0">Nuclear factor-kappa B activity in T cells from patients with rheumatic diseases : a preliminary report .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : The NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the expression of many genes involved in the immune or inflammatory response at the transcriptional level .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The aim of this study was to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> distinctive patterns of NF-kappa B activation are seen in different forms of joint disease</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : The DNA binding activity of these nucleoproteins was examined in purified synovial and peripheral T cells from patients with various chronic rheumatic diseases ( 12 : four with rheumatoid arthritis ; five with spondyloarthropathies ; and three with osteoarthritis ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RESULTS : Electrophoretic mobility shift assays disclosed two specific complexes bound to a NF-kappa B specific 32P-labelled oligonucleotide in nucleoproteins extracted from purified T cells isolated from synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The complexes consisted of p50/p50 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Increased NF-kappa B binding to DNA in synovial T cells was observed relative to peripheral T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In non-rheumatoid arthritis , binding of NF-kappa B in synovial T cells was exclusively mediated by p50/p50 homodimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">CONCLUSION : Overall , the results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that NF-kappa B <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> play a central part in the activation of infiltrating T cells in chronic rheumatoid arthritis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The activation of this nuclear factor is qualitatively different in rheumatoid synovial T cells to that in other forms of non-rheumatoid arthritis ( for example , osteoarthritis , spondyloarthropathies ) .</sentence>
