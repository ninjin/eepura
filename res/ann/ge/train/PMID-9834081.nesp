<sentence id="1">CD40 activation of B cells is strongly influenced by the presence of cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the molecular basis for the interplay between these distinct stimuli is <cue type="spec" id="0">not clearly</cue> delineated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IFN regulatory factor 1 ( IRF-1 ) is a transcription factor activated by either CD40 or cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have found that these different sets of signals target a common cis-acting element in the promoter of this gene , the IRF-1 gamma-activated site ( GAS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="1">Targeting of the IRF-1 GAS is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> confined to activation via CD40</scope> but extends to other stimuli that mimic the CD40 signaling cascade , like TNF-alpha and EBV .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast to induction of STATs by cytokines , the IRF-1 GAS-binding complex activated by CD40 , TNF-alpha , or EBV contains Rel proteins , specifically p50 and p65 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In this system , simultaneous exposure to CD40L together with either IL-4 or IFN-gamma does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> lead to the activation of novel Rel/STAT complexes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Given the importance of IRF-1 in a variety of biologic functions from proliferation to apoptosis , our findings support the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">notion</cue> that modulation of IRF-1 levels <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a critical control point in B cell activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
