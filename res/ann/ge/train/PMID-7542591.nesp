<sentence id="0">Distinct signaling properties identify functionally different CD4 epitopes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The CD4 coreceptor interacts with non-polymorphic regions of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and contributes to T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have investigated the effect of CD4 triggering on T cell activating signals in a lymphoma model using monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) which recognize different CD4 epitopes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate that CD4 triggering delivers signals capable of activating the NF-AT transcription factor which is required for interleukin-2 gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">Whereas</cue> different anti-CD4 mAb or HIV-1 gp120 could all trigger activation of the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn and phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein</scope> , which mediates signals to Ras , they differed significantly in their ability to activate NF-AT .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Lack of full activation of NF-AT <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> be correlated to a dramatically reduced capacity to induce calcium flux</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> be complemented with a calcium ionophore</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results identify functionally distinct epitopes on the CD4 coreceptor involved in activation of the Ras/protein kinase C and calcium pathways .</sentence>
