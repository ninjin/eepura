<sentence id="0">Expression levels of the thyrotropin receptor gene in autoimmune thyroid disease : coregulation with parameters of thyroid function and inverse relation to major histocompatibility complex classes I and II .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using a human TSH receptor ( TSH-R ) cDNA probe , we investigated TSH-R transcript levels in 13 human thyroid fragments by Northern blot analysis ; 7 Graves ' disease , 2 Hashimoto 's disease , 3 endemic goiter , and 1 healthy thyroid gland were studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">TSH-R expression levels were variable , but displayed a close correlation to the expression of thyroid peroxidase ( r = 0.703 ; P < 0.05 ) , thyroglobulin ( r = 0.817 ; P < 0.01 ) , and the nuclear oncogene c-fos ( r = 0.935 ; P < 0.001 ) , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> c-myc</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Overall , TSH-R transcript levels were low or absent in those thyroids in which expression of the major histocompatibility complex class I or II ( MHC I or II ) was high , thus establishing an inverse relation ( MHC I , r = -0.791 ; P < 0.01 ; MHC II , r = -0.784 ; P < 0.01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In situ hybridization showed that apart from lymphocytes , thyroid cells themselves were the source of MHC II transcripts .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">gamma-Interferon expression was only detectable in 1 Hashimoto 's goiter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that next to lymphocyte infiltration , active regulatory events in the thyrocyte are responsible for the inverse relation between functional parameters ( TSH-R , thyroid peroxidase , thyroglobulin , and c-fos ) and immunological markers ( MHC I and II )</scope> .</sentence>
