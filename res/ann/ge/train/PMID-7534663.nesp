<sentence id="0">Aspirin inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B mobilization and monocyte adhesion in stimulated human endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) and E-selectin by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit NF-kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor I kappa B , we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate ( aspirin ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS AND RESULTS : Gel-shift analyses demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-induced NF-kappa B mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol/L .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression by TNF was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range , while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) was hardly affected .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Aspirin <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to prevent VCAM-1 transcription</scope> , since it dose-dependently inhibited induction of VCAM-1 mRNA by TNF .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As a functional consequence , adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF-stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin upregulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These effects of aspirin were <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity</scope> , since indomethacin was ineffective .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">CONCLUSIONS : Our data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that aspirin inhibits NF-kappa B mobilization , induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin , and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF , thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin</scope> .</sentence>
