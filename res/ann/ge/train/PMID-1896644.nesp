<sentence id="0">HIV1 infection of human monocytes and macrophages promotes induction or translocation of NF-KB-related factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In 1991 , we demonstrated , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , that 3 different factors ( termed B1 , B2 and B3 ) with affinity for the KB-enhancer target sequence were specifically detected in nuclear extracts from HIV1-infected monocytes and macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The B2 factor was induced in the nuclei of these cells only upon HIV1 infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The B3 factor was only slightly evident in nuclei of uninfected cells but was readily detectable in nuclei of infected monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Its expression remained very low in nuclei of HIV1-infected macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this paper , we demonstrate that the B2 factor is expressed in the cytosol of monocytes and macrophages as a DNA-binding protein , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> it is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> associated with an inhibitor ( IKB )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This factor remained clustered in the cytosol and was translocated to the nuclei only after HIV1 infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The B3 factor is detected in the cytosol only when cells are HIV1-infected .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The role of HIV1 infection in the expression and the translocation of these factors is discussed .</sentence>
