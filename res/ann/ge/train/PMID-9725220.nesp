<sentence id="0">Transcription of a minimal promoter from the NF-IL6 gene is regulated by CREB/ATF and SP1 proteins in U937 promonocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-IL6 is an important transcriptional regulator of genes induced in activated monocytes/macrophages , and NF-IL6 is the only CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) family member whose steady-state mRNA levels increase upon activation of monocytes ( 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show that increased transcription of the NF-IL6 gene is responsible , at least in part , for induction of NF-IL6 mRNA following activation of U937 promonocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have identified a 104-bp minimal promoter region of the NF-IL6 gene that is sufficient for basal and activation-dependent induction of transcription in U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This region contains binding sites for the cAMP response element-binding protein/activation transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) and Sp1 families of transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Each site is functionally important and contributes independently to transcription of the NF-IL6 gene in U937 cells .</sentence>
