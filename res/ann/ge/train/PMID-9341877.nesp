<sentence id="0">The spatial distribution of human immunoglobulin genes within the nucleus : evidence for gene topography independent of cell type and transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The three-dimensional positioning of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes within the nucleus of human cells was investigated using in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The visualization of heavy and light chain genes in B-lymphoid cells showed that the three Ig genes are differentially and nonrandomly distributed in different nuclear subvolumes : the kappa genes were found to be preferentially confined to an outer nuclear volume , whereas the gamma and lambda genes consistently occupied more central positions within the nucleus , the lambda genes being more interior when compared with the gamma genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The data further show that these overall topographical distributions are independent of gene transcriptional activity and are conserved in different cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although subtle gene movements within those defined topographical regions cannot be excluded by this study , the results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> tissue specificity of gene expression is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> accompanied by drastic changes in gene nuclear topography</scope> , rather <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that gene organization within the nucleus <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be primarily dependent on structural constraints imposed on the respective chromosomes</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
