<sentence id="0">Activation of Stat 5b in erythroid progenitors correlates with the ability of ErbB to induce sustained cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Self renewal of normal erythroid progenitors is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase c-ErbB , whereas other receptors ( c-Kit/Epo-R ) regulate erythroid differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To address <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> mechanisms that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> explain this selective activity of c-ErbB</scope></scope> , we analyzed the ability of these receptors to activate the different members of the Stat transcription factor family .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Ligand activation of c-ErbB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation , DNA-binding , and reporter gene transcription of Stat 5b in erythroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , ligand activation of c-Kit was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">unable</cue> to induce any of these effects in the same cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA-binding of Stat 5b , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">failed</cue> to induce reporter gene transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These biochemical findings correlate perfectly with the selective ability of c-ErbB to cause sustained self renewal in erythroid progenitors .</sentence>
