<sentence id="0">Hypoxia enhances induction of endothelial ICAM-1 : role for metabolic acidosis and proteasomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) is an important molecule in promotion of polymorphonuclear neutrophil transendothelial migration during inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Coincident with many inflammatory diseases is tissue hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that combinations of hypoxia and inflammatory stimuli <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> differentially regulate expression of endothelial ICAM-1</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Human endothelial cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of added lipopolysaccharide ( LPS )</scope> and examined for expression of functional ICAM-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although hypoxia alone did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> induce ICAM-1</scope> , the combination of LPS and hypoxia enhanced ( 3 +/- 0.4-fold over normoxia ) ICAM-1 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Combinations of hypoxia and LPS significantly increased lymphocyte binding , and such increases were inhibited by addition of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Hypoxic endothelia showed a > 10-fold increase in sensitivity to inhibitors of proteasome activation , and combinations of hypoxia and LPS enhanced proteasome-dependent cytoplasmic-to-nuclear localization of the nuclear transcription factor-kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Such proteasome activation correlated with hypoxia-evoked decreases in both extracellular and intracellular pH .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We conclude from these studies that endothelial hypoxia provides a novel , proteasome-dependent stimulus for ICAM-1 induction .</sentence>
