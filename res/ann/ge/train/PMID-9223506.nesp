<sentence id="0">Transcription factor binding sites downstream of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription start site are important for virus infectivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">When transcriptionally active , the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) promoter contains a nucleosome-free region encompassing both the promoter/enhancer region and a large region ( 255 nucleotides [ nt ] ) downstream of the transcription start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have previously identified new binding sites for transcription factors downstream of the transcription start site ( nt 465 to 720 ) : three AP-1 sites ( I , II , and III ) , an AP3-like motif ( AP3-L ) , a downstream binding factor ( DBF ) site , and juxtaposed Sp1 sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that the DBF site is an interferon-responsive factor ( IRF ) binding site and that the AP3-L motif binds the T-cell-specific factor NF-AT .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutations that abolish the binding of each factor to its cognate site are introduced in an infectious HIV-1 molecular clone to study their effect on HIV-1 transcription and replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Individual mutation of the DBF or AP3-L site as well as the double mutation AP-1(III)/AP3-L did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affect HIV-1 replication compared to that of the wild-type virus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , proviruses carrying mutations in the Sp1 sites were totally defective in terms of replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">Virus</cue> production occurred with slightly delayed kinetics for viruses containing combined mutations in the AP-1(III) , AP3-L , and DBF sites and in the AP3-L and DBF-sites</scope> , whereas viruses mutated in the AP-1(I , II , III ) and AP3-L sites and in the AP-1(I , II , III ) , AP3-L , and DBF sites exhibited a severely defective replicative phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">No</cue> RNA-packaging defect could be measured for any of the mutant viruses as determined by quantification of their HIV genomic RNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Measurement of the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter after transient transfection of the HIV-1 provirus DNA or of long terminal repeat-luciferase constructs showed a positive correlation between the transcriptional and the replication defects for most mutants .</sentence>
