<sentence id="0">Repression by Ikaros and Aiolos is mediated through histone deacetylase complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Here we show that the lymphoid lineage-determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can function as strong transcriptional repressors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This function is mediated through two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo-acetylation of core histones at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Consistent with these findings , Ikaros and its repression domains can interact in vivo and in vitro with the mSin3 family of co-repressors which bind to histone deacetylases .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Based on these and our recent findings of associations between Ikaros and Mi-2-HDAC , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that Ikaros family members modulate gene expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct histone deacetylase complexes to specific promoters</scope> .</sentence>
