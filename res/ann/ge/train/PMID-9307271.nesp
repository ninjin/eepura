<sentence id="0">Activation of a novel gene in 3q21 and identification of intergenic fusion transcripts with ecotropic viral insertion site I in leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have identified a novel gene , GR6 , located within the leukemia breakpoint region of 3q21 , that is normally expressed in early fetal development but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in adult peripheral blood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">GR6 is activated in the UCSD-AML1 cell line and in a leukemic sample , both of which carry a t(3 ; 3 ) ( q21 ; q26 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In UCSD-AML1 , we have also identified fusion transcripts between the ecotropic viral insertion site I ( EVI1 ) gene in 3q26 and GR6 and between EVI1 and Ribophorin I that maps 30 kb telomeric to GR6 in 3q21 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">All fusions splice the 5' ends of the 3q21 genes into exon 2 of the EVI1 gene , an event that is similar to the normal intergenic splicing of MDS1-EVI1 and to those previously documented in leukemias with t(3 ; 21 ) and t(3 ; 12 ) , in which acute myelogenous leukemia 1-EVI1 fusions and ETV6-EVI1 fusions , respectively , occur .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The Ribophorin I-EVI1 fusion in particular <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be a common occurrence in t(3 ; 3 )</scope> .</sentence>
