<sentence id="0">AML and Ets proteins regulate the I alpha1 germ-line promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) class switch recombination of B lymphocytes preferentially targets unrearranged IgH genes that have already been rendered transcriptionally active .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transcription of the germ-line IgH genes is controlled by intervening ( I ) regions upstream of their switch regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The I alpha1 promoter activates transcription of the human germ-line C alpha1 gene for IgA1 and mediates the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 responsiveness of this locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that the I alpha1 promoter contains several binding sites for the AML/PEBP2/CBF family of transcription factors and that AML and Ets proteins are major regulators of the basal and TGF-beta-inducible promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our data constitute a starting point for studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TGF-beta regulates IgA production .</sentence>
