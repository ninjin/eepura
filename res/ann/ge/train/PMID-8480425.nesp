<sentence id="0">HIV-1 Nef protein inhibits the recruitment of AP-1 DNA-binding activity in human T-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat , HIV-1-LTR , contains binding sites for several cellular transcription factors which contribute to HIV-1 gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Our previous studies on the function of the HIV-1-encoded Nef protein <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that Nef <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be an inhibitor HIV-1 transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> Nef affects the binding of cellular factors implicated in HIV-1 regulation</scope> , 32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from Nef-expressing T-cell lines that <scope type="spec" id="4"> <scope type="neg" id="2">were <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> stimulated <cue type="spec" id="4">or</cue> were stimulated with T-cell mitogens</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that Nef inhibited the recruitment of AP-1 DNA-binding activity in mitogen-stimulated human T-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Additionally , Nef expressing cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid in which HIV-1 AP-1 DNA recognition sequences were cloned downstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mitogen-mediated transcriptional activation of the CAT gene in this construct was inhibited in Nef-expressing cells but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> in control cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These studies <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that , by inhibiting AP-1 activation , Nef <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> play a role in regulating HIV-1 gene expression in infected T-cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
