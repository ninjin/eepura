<sentence id="0">LPS tolerance in monocytes/macrophages : three 3' cytosins are required in the DNA binding motif for detection of upregulated NF-kappa B p50 homodimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">When monocytes are stimulated with LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) repeatedly then the initially high expression of the TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) gene is only very low , i.e. the cells are tolerant to LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tolerant cells still express the CD14 receptor and they can still be activated to mobilize NF-kappa B into nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis of the binding proteins employing the -605 motif of the human TNF promoter ( GGGGCTGTCCC ) revealed that in tolerant cells of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 there is a predominance of p50p50 of NF-kappa B. We now show that a mutant motif that exchanges the terminal 3' C for a G fails to bind the p50 homodimer that is upregulated in LPS toler ant human Mono Mac 6 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The same is true for nuclear extracts taken from the murine P388D1 macrophage cell line when tested with the -516 motif of the murine TNF promoter ( GGGGGCTTTCCC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here the wild type motif gives efficient binding of p50p50 that again is upregulated in tolerant cells whereas a mutant with a 3' G shows hardly any binding of p50p50 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conversely , the murine kappa light chain enhancer motif ( GGGGACTTTCCG ) does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> efficiently bind the nuclear p50p50 from tolerant murine P388 macrophages</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Binding is , however , readily detected when the 3' G is replaced by a C. These data show that the detection of upregulated p50 homodimers in LPS tolerant cells is dependent on subtle differences in the sequence of the DNA binding motif .</sentence>
