<sentence id="0">Induction of NF-kappa B during monocyte differentiation is associated with activation of HIV-gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are important targets of HIV infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report here that the phenotypic differentiation of monocyte cell lines induced by phorbol esters or tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) is associated with expression of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In parallel with such differentiation , HIV transcription , monitored using an HIV long terminal repeat reporter gene construct , is activated in such cells under the influence of enhanced NF-kappa B expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Also , in a promonocyte cell line chronically infected with HIV , NF-kappa B expression and HIV transcription were enhanced on stimulation with phorbol ester or TNF alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , stimulation of monocyte cell lines by phorbol esters or TNF alpha induces cell differentiation and activates HIV transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Such a process <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> have fundamental implications in AIDS pathogenesis in vivo</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be important in disease progression induced by opportunistic infections <scope type="spec" id="2"> directly <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> indirectly</scope> involving macrophages</scope> .</sentence>
