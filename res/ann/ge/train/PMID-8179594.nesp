<sentence id="0">Effects of alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid on expression of proto-oncogene c-fos .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcription factor AP-1 is an important human mediator of the cellular response to serum , growth factors , and phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13 acetate ( TPA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The AP-1 complex consists of distinct protein heterodimers encoded by the proto-oncogene c-fos and c-jun mRNA whose gene expression can be induced by TPA , cyclic AMP and growth factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recent findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> an involvement of reactive oxygen species in the pathway of TPA and protein kinase C leading to expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To investigate the role of reactive oxygen species we studied the effects of alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid ( natural thiol antioxidants ) on the expression of c-fos mRNA in human Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When cells were preincubated with dihydrolipoic acid ( 0.2 mM ) the expression of c-fos mRNA was suppressed at 30 min after stimulation of TPA ( 0.5 microM ) whereas in the case of preincubation of alpha-lipoic acid ( 0.2 microM ) , the expression was enhanced at 30 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These studies support the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">idea</cue> that superoxide anion radical plays a role in the expression of c-fos mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
