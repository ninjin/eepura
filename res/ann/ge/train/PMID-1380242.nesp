<sentence id="1">Activation of T lymphocytes induces transcription of genes encoding for lymphokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene expression is controlled transcriptionally by the cooperative activity of specific trans-activating factors that bind to the IL-2 enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 inhibit the production of IL-2 in T lymphocytes at the level of gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A member of the src gene family , the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase , p56lck , has been implicated in IL-2 production .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">CsA was found <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> to inhibit lck gene expression</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">nor</cue> the activity of the lck gene product</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , CsA and FK506 inhibit the appearance of DNA binding activity of factors that bind to the NF-AT and AP-1 sites in the IL-2 enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Since the induction of NF-AT and AP-1 is induced by the same stimuli that stimulate IL-2 production , these results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> the immunosuppressant action of CsA and FK506 is exerted at the level of these trans-activating factors</scope> .</sentence>
