<sentence id="0">Activation of the signal transducer and transcription ( STAT ) signaling pathway in a primary T cell response .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Critical role for IL-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The T cell activation is initiated by interaction of specific Ags with TCR , followed by activation of intracellular biochemical events leading to activation of several genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins in a primary TCR-mediated activation of T cells have been explored .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In purified human peripheral blood T cells , nuclear STAT proteins were activated approximately 3 h after activation by cross-linked anti-CD3 Abs. These STAT proteins were detected by using the IFN-gamma-activated sequence ( GAS ) and related oligonucleotides as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Analysis of the nuclear extracts with anti-STAT Abs <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> they contained STAT-3 and additional proteins crossreactive with the STAT family</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The induction of STAT activity was inhibited completely by pretreatment with either cycloheximide or cyclosporin A , thus <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the induction was due to a secondary factor produced by the activated T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As neutralizing anti-IL-6 Abs effectively down-regulated the early induction of STAT proteins and as exogenously added IL-6 rapidly activated DNA binding similar to TCR-mediated bindings , it can be concluded that IL-6 is the factor responsible for the activation of STAT proteins in a primary T cell response .</sentence>
