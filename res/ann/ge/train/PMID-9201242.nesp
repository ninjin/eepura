<sentence id="0">Effect of adenovirus 2 on cellular gene activation in blood-derived monocytes and macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have investigated the effect of adenovirus 2 ( Ad2 ) infection on human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages with regard to expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In monocytes , the virus was bound to the surface <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> being internalized</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">On the other hand , Ad2 was internalized by macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">No</cue> virus replication and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> transcription of the Ad2 early genes was observed in either of the cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Ad2 infection induced transient increase in the mRNA levels for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in both monocytes and in macrophages , although the kinetics of the transcription was slightly different .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The production of both cytokines , measured by ELISA tests , was enhanced in monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In macrophages , a slight enhancement of TNF-alpha production was seen , whereas <scope type="neg" id="3">IL-1 beta was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> detected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> <scope type="spec" id="6"> cellular genes <cue type="spec" id="6">might</cue> be activated by Ad2 virus infection in nonpermissive cells where <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> viral gene products could be detected</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
