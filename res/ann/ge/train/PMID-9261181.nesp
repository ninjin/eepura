<sentence id="0">Transcription factor GATA-3 is differentially expressed in murine Th1 and Th2 cells and controls Th2-specific expression of the interleukin-5 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) , which is produced by CD4(+) T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> by Th1 cells</scope> , plays a key role in the development of eosinophilia in asthma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Despite increasing evidence that the outcome of many diseases is determined by the ratio of the two subsets of CD4(+) T helper cells , Th1 and Th2 , the molecular basis for Th1- and Th2- specific gene expression remains to be elucidated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We previously established a critical role for the transcription factor GATA-3 in IL-5 promoter activation in EL-4 cells , which express both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our studies reported here demonstrate that GATA-3 is critical for expression of the IL-5 gene in bona fide Th2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Whereas mutations in the GATA-3 site abolished antigen- or cAMP- stimulated IL-5 promoter activation in Th2 cells , ectopic expression of GATA-3 in Th1 cells or in a non-lymphoid , non-IL-5-producing cell line activated the IL-5 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">During the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice , GATA-3 gene expression was up-regulated in developing Th2 cells , but was down-regulated in Th1 cells , and antigen- or cAMP-activated Th2 cells ( but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> Th1 cells )</scope> expressed the GATA-3 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , GATA-3 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> play an important role in the balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Inhibition of GATA-3 activity has therapeutic potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic diseases .</sentence>
