<sentence id="0">Functional antagonism between vitamin D3 and retinoic acid in the regulation of CD14 and CD23 expression during monocytic differentiation of U-937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">1,25 alpha-Dihydroxicholecalciferol ( VitD3 ) and retinoic acid ( RA ) are important regulators of the proliferation and differentiation of several cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This paper describes how the expression of the monocyte-macrophage Ag , CD14 , and the low affinity Fc receptor for IgE , CD23 , were inversely regulated during VitD3- and RA-induced monocytic differentiation of human U-937 monoblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">PMA induced the expression of both CD14 and CD23 mRNA and protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Exposure to VitD3 rapidly induced the de novo expression of CD14 mRNA and protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The addition of cycloheximide completely blocked the VitD3 induction of CD14 mRNA expression , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the induction was dependent on ongoing protein synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">While inducing CD14 expression , VitD3 concomitantly suppressed the basal , PMA- , and RA-inducible CD23 expression in a dose-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , U-937 cells induced by RA strongly increased their expression of CD23 mRNA and protein , whereas they completely <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacked</cue> detectable CD14 cell surface or mRNA expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , the VitD3- and the PMA-induced CD14 expression was inhibited as a temporal consequence of the RA-induced differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that there exists a functional antagonism between VitD3 and RA that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> have important implications for the regulation of certain immune and inflammatory responses through their inverse effects on CD14 and CD23 gene expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
