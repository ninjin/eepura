<sentence id="0">Nuclear Rel-A and c-Rel protein complexes are differentially distributed within human thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) / Rel proteins are inducible transcriptional regulators of numerous cellular genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">They are particularly abundant in lymphoid tissues and <scope type="spec" id="0"> are <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be critical for the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have reported previously that a nuclear NF-kappa B activity was present in freshly extracted human thymocytes in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of in vitro treatment of these cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present report , we identified NF-kappa B proteins extracted from human thymocyte nuclei as being p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Immunochemical and immunofluorescent staining of thymus sections using specific Abs allowed visualization of nuclear NF-kappa B proteins in both thymocytes and nonthymocyte cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This detection <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> a preferential activation of p50/c-Rel in medullary thymocytes</scope> , whereas p50/p65 was present in both cortical and medullary regions of human thymus lobules .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , the intensity of p65 labeling was much higher in several thymocytes from the medulla .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">p65 , p50 , and c-Rel activities were found in both CD4- and CD8-positive thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that p65 and c-Rel complexes play distinct roles in gene expression and that both forms of NF-kappa B play critical roles during late stages of the intrathymic maturation of T cells</scope> .</sentence>
