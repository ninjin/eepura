<sentence id="0">The NF kappa B independent cis-acting sequences in HIV-1 LTR responsive to T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The rate of transcription initiation directed by the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 increases in response to mitogenic stimuli of T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that <scope type="spec" id="0"> the response of the HIV-1 LTR <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be governed by two independent sequences located 5' to the site of transcription initiation sequences that bind either NFAT-1 or NF kappa B. The rate of LTR-directed gene expression</scope> increased in response to treatment with either a phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha if either the NFAT-1 or NF kappa B binding sites were deleted , but failed to respond to these mitogenic stimuli if both sequences were absent .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The HIV-1 mutant virus containing both NF kappa B and NFAT-1 deletion was able to replicate although at a much decreased growth rate , while the deletion of NFAT-1 alone increased the viral growth rate in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Neither deletion of NF kappa B nor deletion of NFAT-1 decreased activation of viral replication by phorbol ester .</sentence>
