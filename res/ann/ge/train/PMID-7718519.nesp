<sentence id="0">IL-1 receptor and TCR signals synergize to activate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)- and TCR-initiated signals can interact synergistically to increase the rate of transcription of several lymphokine and lymphokine receptor genes during the competence phase of the activation program in T helper lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this report we describe how signals initiated through the type I IL-1R interact with signals from the antigen receptor to synergistically augment the transactivating properties of NF-kappa B. The synergistic antigen receptor initiated signals are mediated through protein kinase C because they can be mimicked by the phorbol ester , 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> with calcium ionophores</scope> ; and are staurosporine sensitive but cyclosporine resistant .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Gel shift analyses demonstrate that NF-kappa B nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by IL-1 <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> by antigen receptor signals</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on NF-kappa B functional activity is independent of I kappa B alpha (MAD3)-NF-kappa B dissociation in the cytosol and <scope type="neg" id="2">is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> associated with I kappa B nuclear translocation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The IL-1-induced NF-kappa B DNA nuclear localization is transient and can be prolonged either by an antigen receptor-initiated signal or by inhibiting protein synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that IL-1 induces both NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and the synthesis of a protein(s) responsible for terminating NF-kappa B-DNA interaction in the nucleus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Antigen receptor signals prolong NF-kappa B-DNA interaction , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">probably</cue> by functionally antagonizing the IL-1-induced synthesis of a protein(s) responsible for the transient NF-kappa B-DNA interaction</scope> and consequently synergistically enhance IL-1-induced NF-kappa B-dependent gene transcription .</sentence>
