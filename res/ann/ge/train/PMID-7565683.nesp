<sentence id="0">N- and C-terminal sequences control degradation of MAD3/I kappa B alpha in response to inducers of NF-kappa B activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The proteolytic degradation of the inhibitory protein MAD3/I kappa B alpha in response to extracellular stimulation is a prerequisite step in the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Analysis of the expression of human I kappa B alpha protein in stable transfectants of mouse 70Z/3 cells shows that , as for the endogenous murine protein , exogenous I kappa B alpha is degraded in response to inducers of NF-kappa B activity , such as phorbol myristate acetate or lipopolysaccharide .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , pretreatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal inhibits this ligand-induced degradation and , in agreement with previous studies , stabilizes a hyperphosphorylated form of the human I kappa B alpha protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By expressing mutant forms of the human protein in this cell line , we have been able to delineate the sequences responsible for both the ligand-induced phosphorylation and the degradation of I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our results show that deletion of the C terminus of the I kappa B alpha molecule up to amino acid 279 abolishes constitutive but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> ligand-inducible phosphorylation</scope> and inhibits ligand-inducible degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further analysis reveals that the inducible phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha maps to two serines in the N terminus of the protein ( residues 32 and 36 ) and that the mutation of either residue is sufficient to abolish ligand-induced degradation , whereas both residues must be mutated to abolish inducible phosphorylation of the protein .</sentence>
