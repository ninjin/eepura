<sentence id="0">Positive and negative regulation of IL-2 gene expression : role of multiple regulatory sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) is an important lymphokine required in the process of T cell activation , proliferation , clonal expansion and differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The IL-2 gene displays both T cell specific and inducible expression : it is only expressed in CD4+ T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Several cis-acting regulatory sites are required for induction of the IL-2 gene after stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we have analysed the function of these cis-acting regulatory sites in the context of the native IL-2 enhancer and promoter sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results of this study <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the NFAT ( -276 to -261 ) , the distal octamer ( -256 to -248 ) and the proximal octamer ( -75 to -66 ) sites not only act as enhancers of IL-2 gene transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation , but also have a silencing effect on IL-2 gene expression in resting cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Two other sites display disparate effects on IL-2 gene expression in different T leukemia cell lines : the distal purine box ( -291 to -277 ) and the proximal purine box sites ( -145 to -128 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , the AP-1 ( -186 to -176 ) and the kappa B sites ( -206 to -195 ) respond to different cellular activation in EL4 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The AP-1 site mediated the response to PMA stimulation while the kappa B site responded to IL-1 stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the regulation of IL-2 gene expression is a complex process and multiple cis-acting regulatory sites interact to exert different effects in T cells representative of alternative stages of differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
