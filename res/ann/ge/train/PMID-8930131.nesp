<sentence id="0">The Oct-2 transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Oct-2 transcription factor is a member of the POU ( Pit-Oct-Unc ) family of transcription factors and is expressed only in B lymphocytes and in neuronal cells but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in other cell types</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The primary RNA transcript of the gene is subject to alternative splicing to yield different variants which can either activate or repress gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The forms produced in B lymphocytes have a predominantly activating effect on gene expression whereas those produced in neuronal cells have a predominantly inhibitory effect and can repress the expression of both the herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes and the cellular tyrosine hydroxylase gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus Oct-2 plays an important role in the regulation of cellular gene expression in both B cells and neuronal cells as well as in the control of viral latency .</sentence>
