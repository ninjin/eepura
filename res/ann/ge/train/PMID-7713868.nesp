<sentence id="0">Platelet-activating factor stimulates transcription of the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor in monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Correlation with an increased kappa B binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Human peripheral blood monocytes responded to stimulation of platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) with up-regulation of the transcript for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) , a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This function of PAF was observed at nanomolar concentrations of the ligand , starting at 30 min after stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The PAF-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA was accompanied by an increase in kappa B binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="0"> These functions of PAF <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to be mediated through the cell surface PAF receptors</scope> , as two PAF receptor antagonists , WEB 2086 and L-659,989 , blocked both the up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity induced by PAF .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The antagonists , however , had <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pretreatment of monocytes with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of PAF , whereas cholera toxin had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> inhibitory effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor for NF-kappa B activation , markedly reduced PAF-stimulated kappa B binding activity as well as up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">potential</cue> role of PAF in HB-EGF expression</scope></scope> and provide evidence that this stimulation <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> occur through increased kappa B binding activity</scope> .</sentence>
