<sentence id="0">The DNA binding domain of the A-MYB transcription factor is responsible for its B cell-specific activity and binds to a B cell 110-kDa nuclear protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression studies as well as the use of transgenic animals have demonstrated that the A-MYB transcription factor plays central and specific role in the regulation of mature B cell proliferation and/or differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Furthermore , it is highly expressed in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> participate in the pathogenesis of this disease</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have therefore investigated the transcriptional activity of A-MYB and its regulation in several human lymphoid cell lines using co-transfection assays and show that A-MYB is transcriptionally active in all the B cell lines studied , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In particular the best responder cell line was the Burkitt 's cell line Namalwa .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The activity of A-MYB in B and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> T cells</scope> was observed when either an artificial construct or the c-MYC promoter was used as a reporter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the functional domains responsible for DNA binding , transactivation , and negative regulation , previously characterized in a fibroblast context , were found to have similar activity in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The region of A-MYB responsible for the B cell specific activity was defined to be the N-terminal 218 amino acids containing the DNA binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , a 110-kDa protein has been identified in the nuclei of all the B , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> T</scope> , cell lines that specifically binds to this A-MYB N-terminal domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">hypothesize</cue> that this 110-kDa protein <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be a functionally important B cell-specific co-activator of A-MYB</scope></scope> .</sentence>
