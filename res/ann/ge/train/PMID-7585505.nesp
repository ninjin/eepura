<sentence id="0">The normal cell cycle activation program is exploited during the infection of quiescent B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">B lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation are maintained in a non-proliferative state .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Antigen recognition stimulates limited proliferation , whereas infection with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) results in continual proliferation and the outgrowth of immortal cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Because it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">not clear</cue> at which point in cell cycle the peripheral B lymphocytes are arrested</scope> , we characterized the expression of several cell cycle-associated genes in quiescent and stimulated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that the expression of four cell genes , cdc-2 , cyclin E , CD23 , and cyclin D2 , are up-regulated approximately 100-fold as a result of EBV-mediated immortalization .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Because these genes play a positive role in cell proliferation , we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that this regulatory switch contributes to controlling entry into the cell cycle</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transient stimulation of quiescent B lymphocytes with either a cocktail of anti-CD40 , anti-IgM , and IL4 , or EBV results in the rapid expression of the same four genes , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that , after infection , EBV exploits the normal program of B-lymphocyte cell cycle activation</scope> .</sentence>
