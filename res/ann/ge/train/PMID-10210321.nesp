<sentence id="0">Unexpected and coordinated expression of Spi-1 , Fli-1 , and megakaryocytic genes in four Epo-dependent cell lines established from transgenic mice displaying erythroid-specific expression of a thermosensitive SV40 T antigen .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Most erythroleukemic cell lines established in vitro coexpress erythrocytic and megakaryocytic markers that often are associated with expression of Spi-1 and/or Fli-1 transcription factors known as transactivators of megakaryocyte-specific promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we examined the possibility of establishing new cell lines keeping strictly erythroid-specific properties in vitro through the targeted and conditional immortalization of erythrocytic progenitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For that purpose , we established several lines of transgenic mice displaying erythroid-specific expression of a thermosensitive SV40 T antigen .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As expected , these transgenic mice developed splenomegaly due to the massive amplification of Ter 119 positive erythroid nucleated cells expressing T antigen .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Despite this drastic effect in vivo , the in vitro immortalization of erythropoietin-dependent erythroid progenitors unexpectedly occurred at low frequency , and all four cell lines established expressed both erythrocytic ( globins ) and megakaryocytic markers ( glycoprotein IIb , platelet factor 4 ) as well as Spi-1 and Fli-1 transcripts at permissive temperature .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Switching the cells to the nonpermissive temperature led to a marked increase in globin gene expression and concomitant decrease in expression of Spi-1 , Fli-1 , and megakaryocytic genes in an erythropoietin-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , enhanced expression of Spi-1 and Fli-1 genes already was detected in the Ter 119 positive cell population of transgenic mice spleen in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , like normal Ter 119 erythroid cells , these Ter 119 positive cells from transgenic mice still expressed high levels of beta-globin and very low or undetectable glycoprotein IIb and platelet factor 4 megakaryocytic transcripts .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , these data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> the unexpected expression of megakaryocytic genes is a specific property of immortalized cells that cannot be explained only by enhanced expression of Spi-1 and/or Fli-1 genes</scope> .</sentence>
