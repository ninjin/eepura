<sentence id="0">Evidence for lowered induction of nuclear factor kappa B in activated human T lymphocytes during aging .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factor NF kappa B ( nuclear factor kappa B ) is induced in T lymphocytes from young individuals following activation with a variety of stimuli including anti-CD3 , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In contrast , activated T lymphocytes from older individuals show a significant reduction in the induction of NF kappa B in response to the same stimuli .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0">The age-related decline in induction of NF kappa B <cue type="neg" id="0">could not</cue> be attributed to alteration in the composition of subunits</scope> , p50 and p65 were found to be the predominant subunits of induced NF kappa B in T cells from young as well as elderly donors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , similar levels of NF kappa B were found in the cytosols of unactivated T cells from both young and elderly donors <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that precursor levels of NF kappa B remain unaltered during aging</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that an age-associated decline in the induction of NF kappa B in activated T cells from elderly individuals <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be attributable to altered regulation of the inhibitor , I kappa B</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> play an important role in immune dysregulation accompanying aging</scope></scope> .</sentence>
