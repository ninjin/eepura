<sentence id="0">Induction of a functional vitamin D receptor in all-trans-retinoic acid-induced monocytic differentiation of M2-type leukemic blast cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Different types of acute myeloid leukemia blast cells were induced to differentiate in vitro with all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and vitamin D3 ( VD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">M0/M1 leukemic cells are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> sensitive to differentiating agents</scope> , whereas M3 leukemic cells are induced to undergo granulocytic differentiation after ATRA treatment but are <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> sensitive to VD</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">M2 leukemic blast cells behave differently because they undergo monocytic differentiation with both the differentiation inducers .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To gain some insight into the maturation of M2-type leukemic cells , we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying monocytic differentiation induced by ATRA and VD in spontaneous M2 blast cells as well as in Kasumi-1 cells ( an acute myeloid leukemia M2-type cell line ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> ATRA as well as VD efficiently increases the nuclear abundance of VD receptor ( VDR ) and promotes monocytic differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">VDR is functionally active in ATRA-treated Kasumi-1 cells because it efficiently heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor , binds to a DR3-type vitamin D-responsive element , and activates the transcription of a vitamin D-responsive element-regulated reporter gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with these findings , VD-responsive genes are induced by ATRA treatment of Kasumi-1 cells , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that the genetic program underlying monocytic differentiation is activated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="4"> The molecular mechanism by which ATRA increases the nuclear abundance of a functional VDR is still <cue type="spec" id="4">unknown</cue></scope> , but our data clearly <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> the M2 leukemic cell context is only permissive of monocytic differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
