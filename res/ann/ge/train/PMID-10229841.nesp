<sentence id="0">Signaling through the lymphotoxin-beta receptor stimulates HIV-1 replication alone and in cooperation with soluble or membrane-bound TNF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The level of ongoing HIV-1 replication within an individual is critical to HIV-1 pathogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Among host immune factors , the cytokine TNF-alpha has previously been shown to increase HIV-1 replication in various monocyte and T cell model systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we demonstrate that signaling through the TNF receptor family member , the lymphotoxin-beta ( LT-beta ) receptor ( LT-betaR ) , also regulates HIV-1 replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , HIV-1 replication is cooperatively stimulated when the distinct LT-betaR and TNF receptor systems are simultaneously engaged by their specific ligands .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , in a physiological coculture cellular assay system , we show that membrane-bound TNF-alpha and LT-alpha1beta2 act virtually identically to their soluble forms in the regulation of HIV-1 replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="0"> cosignaling via the LT-beta and TNF-alpha receptors is <cue type="spec" id="0">probably</cue> involved in the modulation of HIV-1 replication and the subsequent determination of HIV-1 viral burden in monocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Intriguingly , surface expression of LT-alpha1beta2 is up-regulated on a T cell line acutely infected with HIV-1 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a positive feedback loop between HIV-1 infection , LT-alpha1beta2 expression , and HIV-1 replication</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Given the critical role that LT-alpha1beta2 plays in lymphoid architecture , we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">speculate</cue> that LT-alpha1beta2 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be involved in HIV-associated abnormalities of the lymphoid organs</scope></scope> .</sentence>
