<sentence id="0">The human myelomonocytic cell line U-937 as a model for studying alterations in steroid-induced monokine gene expression : marked enhancement of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated interleukin-1 beta messenger RNA levels by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The active metabolite of vitamin D , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25-(OH)2D3 ] , is a potent regulator of human monocyte/macrophage function in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To establish a model for 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of human monocyte monokine synthesis , three human cell lines ( U-937 , THP-1 , and HL-60 ) were examined for : 1 ) the presence of functional 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors ; 2 ) the accumulation of interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) mRNA and IL-1 beta protein in response to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ; and 3 ) the regulation of this response by 1,25-(OH)2D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">All three cell lines expressed vitamin D receptor and had increased levels of IL-1 beta mRNA in response to LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Preincubation of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 augmented IL-1 beta mRNA levels only in U-937 and HL-60 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">From these data , and taking into consideration their state of differentiation and relative ease of culture , U-937 was chosen over HL-60 and THP-1 as the cell line we further characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In U-937 cells , optimum time and dose of pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 were determined to be 12-24 h at a receptor saturating concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 ( 10 nM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Preincubation of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on the time course of IL-1 beta mRNA appearance in response to LPS</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , exposure of U-937 cells to 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased by 200 % the level of IL-1 beta mRNA detected and decreased by three orders of magnitude the concentration of LPS required to achieve steady state mRNA levels equivalent to those observed in U-937 cells <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> preincubated with the hormone.2+o</scope></sentence>
