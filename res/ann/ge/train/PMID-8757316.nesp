<sentence id="0">Alpha 4 beta 1 ( CD49d/CD29 ) integrin costimulation of human T cells enhances transcription factor and cytokine induction in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of altered sensitivity to anti-CD3 stimulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The integrin alpha 4 beta 1 can provide a costimulus to induce IL-2 secretion and IL-2R expression leading to enhanced proliferation of purified , peripheral blood T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Similar to expression of IL-2 , we demonstrated that recombinant vascular-cell adhesion molecule-1 , when co-immobilized with anti-CD3 mAb , significantly enhanced the induction of transcription factors NF-AT , AP-1 , and NF-kappa B as determined by electromobility shift assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">alpha 4 beta 1 ligation alone had <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on transcription factor binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The requirements for induction of transcription factors reflected the requirements for the secretion of multiple cytokines , including IL-2 , TNF-alpha , IFN-gamma , and granulocyte macrophage-CSF .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast to freshly isolated T cells , in vitro-cultured T cells did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> require costimulation for cytokine secretion in response to anti-CD3 alone</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Comparison of the dose response to anti-CD3 stimulation demonstrated that half-maximal induction of IL-2 was achieved using the same dose of anti-CD3 for both freshly isolated and cultured T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , the dose of OKT3 required to achieve half-maximal activation was the same using PMA or different concentrations of alpha 4 beta 1 ligands .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , costimulation by alpha 4 beta 1 ligands was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> due to stabilization of the interaction of the cells with its substrate</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We conclude , rather , that alpha 4 beta 1 in freshly isolated T cells delivers a distinct signal that synergizes early with signals initiated by TCR/CD3 ligation to induce DNA binding of multiple transcription factors required for cytokine gene induction .</sentence>
