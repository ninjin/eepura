<sentence id="0">Oxidative stress suppresses transcription factor activities in stimulated lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Effects of oxidative stress on stimulation-dependent signal transduction , leading to IL-2 expression , were studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Purified quiescent human blood T lymphocytes were subjected to : ( i ) acute exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; ( ii ) chronic exposure to hydrogen peroxide ; and ( iii ) acute exposure to ionizing radiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The cells were then stimulated for 6 h. DNA-binding activities ( determined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) of three transcription factors : NFkappaB , AP-1 and NFAT , were abolished in the lymphocytes by all three modes of oxidative stress .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The lymphocytes exhibited lipid peroxidation only upon exposure to the lowest level of hydrogen peroxide used ( 20 microM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">All three modes of oxidative stress induced catalase activity in the lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The only exception was hydrogen peroxide at 20 microM , which did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> induce catalase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that : ( i ) suppression of specific transcription factor functions can <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> serve as a marker of exposure to oxidative stress and its effects on human lymphocytes</scope> ; ( ii ) lipid peroxidation is only detectable in human lymphocytes upon exposure to weak oxidative stress which does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> induce catalase activity</scope> ; ( iii ) therefore , transcription factor DNA-binding activities are more sensitive to oxidative stress than lipid peroxidation .</sentence>
