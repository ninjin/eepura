<sentence id="1">The regulation of NF-kappa B activation following the triggering of HLA-DR antigens by mAb L243 has been studied at various times in Raji cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a strong increase of NF-kappa B DNA binding after triggering of HLA-DR antigens .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using TNF-alpha-activity neutralizing antibodies , the authors demonstrated that the upregulation of NF-kappa B was found to depend , at later time point , on an autocrine effect of TNF-alpha secreted following triggering of HLA-DR antigens .</sentence>
