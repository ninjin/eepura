<sentence id="0">Overexpression of HSF2-beta inhibits hemin-induced heat shock gene expression and erythroid differentiation in K562 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Acquisition of heat shock factor 2 ( HSF2 ) DNA binding activity is accompanied by induced transcription of heat shock genes in hemin-treated K562 cells undergoing erythroid differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies revealed that HSF2 consists of two alternatively spliced isoforms , HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta , whose relative abundance is developmentally regulated and varies between different tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the molar ratio of HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta isoforms is crucial for the activation of HSF2</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the HSF2 isoforms play functionally distinct roles during the hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation</scope> , we generated cell clones expressing different levels of HSF2-alpha and HSF2-beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that in parental K562 cells , the HSF2-alpha isoform is predominantly expressed and HSF2 can be activated upon hemin treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , when HSF2-beta is expressed at levels exceeding those of endogenous HSF2-alpha , the hemin-induced DNA binding activity and transcription of heat shock genes are repressed , whereas overexpression of HSF2-alpha results in an enhanced hemin response .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the hemin-induced accumulation of globin , known as a marker of erythroid differentiation , is decreased in cells overexpressing HSF2-beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that HSF2-beta acts as a negative regulator of HSF2 activity during hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells</scope> .</sentence>
