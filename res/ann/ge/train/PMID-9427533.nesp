<sentence id="0">Competent transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in cell-free extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum groups B and D in an optimized RNA transcription assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human autosomal recessive disease , xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) , can result from mutations in any one of seven genes , designated XPA through XPG .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Of these , the XPB and XPD genes encode proteins that are subunits of a general transcription factor , TFIIH , involved in both nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and initiation of mRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In humans , mutation of the XPB or XPD gene impairs NER , resulting in hyper-sensitivity to sunlight and greatly increased skin tumor formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> transcription deficiency has been demonstrated in either XP-B or XP-D</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have employed an optimized cell-free RNA transcription assay to analyze transcription activity of XP-B and XP-D .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although the growth rate was normal , the XP-B and XP-D cells contained reduced amounts of TFIIH .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Extracts prepared from XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells exhibited similar transcription activity from the adenovirus major late promoter when compared to that in extracts from normal cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , we conclude that the XP-B and XP-D lymphoblastoid cells do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> have impaired RNA transcription activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We consider the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> consequences of the reduced cellular content of TFIIH for the clinical symptoms in XP-B or XP-D patients</scope> , and discuss a ' conditional phenotype ' that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> involve an impairment of cellular function only under certain growth conditions</scope> .</sentence>
