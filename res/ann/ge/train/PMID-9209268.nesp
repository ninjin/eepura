<sentence id="0">Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B by beta-amyloid peptides and interferon-gamma in murine microglia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An increasing body of evidence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that amyloid-beta ( A beta ) peptides and microglia are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In an effort to further elucidate the biological effects of A beta towards microglia , we investigated the ability of A beta peptides to activate nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B in the N9 murine microglial cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Co-stimulation of microglia with suboptimal concentrations of A beta(25-35) and 100 U/ml IFN gamma resulted in the detection of a specific NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel mobility shift assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This response required at least 120 min to be evident and supershift experiments revealed that the NF-kappa B complex contains both RelA and p50 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Accordingly , immunoblot experiments showed that amongst NF-kappa B/Rel proteins , RelA and p50 are mobilized to the nucleus following microglial cell stimulation with A beta(25-35) plus IFN gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Higher concentrations of A beta(25-35) were effective by themselves in inducing NF-kappa B activation , both in the N9 microglial cell line and in rat primary microglia , as well as in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">For purposes of comparison , microglia were also stimulated with bacterial LPS , a known NF-kappa B inducer .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">As expected , LPS strongly induced the formation of two NF-kappa B DNA-binding activities , one of which was identified as RelA/p50 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The LPS response was also more rapid , as it was already evident by 40 min and remained sustained for up to 3 h. Collectively , these findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> NF-kappa B activation <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> constitute one of the mechanisms underlying the inducible expression of kappa B-dependent genes in microglia stimulated <scope type="spec" id="3"> by A beta peptides and IFN gamma , <cue type="spec" id="3">or</cue> by LPS</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
