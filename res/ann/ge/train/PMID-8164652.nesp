<sentence id="0">Function of NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites in the major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain promoter is dependent on cell-specific binding of different NF-kappa B/Rel subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The promoter of the human major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant-chain gene ( Ii ) contains two NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites located at -109 to -118 ( Ii kappa B-1 ) and -163 to -172 ( Ii kappa B-2 ) from the transcription start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report here that the differential function of each of these NF-kappa B/Rel sites in several distinct cell types depends on cell-specific binding of NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Ii kappa B-1 is a positive regulatory element in B-cell lines and in the Ii-expressing T-cell line , H9 , but acts as a negative regulatory element in myelomonocytic and glia cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In vivo protein-DNA contacts are detectable at Ii kappa B-1 in cell lines in which this site is functional as either a positive or negative regulator .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays determine that members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors can bind to this site in vitro and that DNA-binding complexes that contain p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlate with positive regulation whereas the presence of p50 correlates with negative regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Ii kappa B-2 is a site of positive regulation in B-cell lines and a site of negative regulation in H9 T cells , myelomonocytic , and glial cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In vivo occupancy of this site is observed only in the H9 T-cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Again , in vitro supershift studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> the presence of p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlates with positive function whereas the presence of only p50 and p52 correlates with negative function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="1"> This differential binding of specific NF-kappa B/Rel subunits is <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to mediate the disparate functions of these two NF-kappa B/Rel binding sites</scope> .</sentence>
