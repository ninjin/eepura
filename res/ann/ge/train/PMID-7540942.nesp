<sentence id="0">Cross-linking of CD30 induces HIV expression in chronically infected T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD30 , a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , is expressed constitutively on the surface of the human T cell line ACH-2 , which is chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV)-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate that cross-linking CD30 with an anti-CD30-specific monoclonal antibody , which mimics the described biological activities of the CD30 ligand ( CD30L ) , results in HIV expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">CD30 cross-linking does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> alter proliferation of ACH-2 cells</scope> and <scope type="neg" id="1">the induction of HIV expression is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> mediated by endogenous TNF alpha/beta</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , cross-linking of CD30 leads to NF-kappa B activation and enhanced HIV transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , CD30-CD30L interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a kappa B-dependent pathway that is independent of TNF .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This mechanism <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be important in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected CD4+ T cells , especially in lymphoid organs where cell to cell contact is conducive to receptor-ligand interactions</scope> .</sentence>
