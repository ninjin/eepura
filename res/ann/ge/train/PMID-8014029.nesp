<sentence id="0">Increased interleukin 2 transcription in murine lymphocytes by ciprofloxacin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The fluoroquinolone antibiotic , ciprofloxacin ( cipro ) , induces hyperproduction of interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) in stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL-2 and IL-2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated ( T cell mitogens or alloantigens ) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL-4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin ( 5-80 micrograms/ml ) as compared to control cells <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> antibiotics</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , in contrast to human lymphocytes , IFN-gamma production was inhibited and IFN-gamma mRNA levels were unaffected at 24 h and only slightly upregulated at 48 and 72 h of culture in murine splenocytes incubated with cipro ( 20 micrograms/ml ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">EL-4 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter and enhancer region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Analysis of CAT activity revealed that cipro enhanced IL-2 gene induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , EL-4 cells incubated with ciprofloxacin showed an early peak and more activated nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT-1 ) as compared to control cells <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> antibiotics</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Cipro did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affect the nuclear transcription factors AP-1 or NFIL-2A</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , cipro inhibited IFN-gamma synthesis , but enhanced IL-2 production in murine lymphocytes by means of influencing NFAT-1 and causing an increased IL-2 transcription .</sentence>
