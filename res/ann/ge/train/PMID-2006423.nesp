<sentence id="0">Isolation of a rel-related human cDNA that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> encodes the 65-kD subunit of NF-kappa B</scope> [ published erratum appears in Science 1991 Oct 4 ; 254(5028):11 ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A DNA probe that spanned a domain conserved among the proto-oncogene c-rel , the Drosophila morphogen dorsal , and the p50 DNA binding subunit of NF-kappa B was generated from Jurkat T cell complementary DNA with the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and degenerate oligonucleotides .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This probe was used to identify a rel-related complementary DNA that hybridized to a 2.6-kilobase messenger RNA present in human T and B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In vitro transcription and translation of the complementary DNA resulted in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular size of 65 kilodaltons ( kD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The translated protein showed weak DNA binding with a specificity for the kappa B binding motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This protein-DNA complex comigrated with the complex obtained with the purified human p65 NF-kappa B subunit and binding was inhibited by I kappa B-alpha and -beta proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , the 65-kD protein associated with the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B and the kappa B probe to form a complex with the same electrophoretic mobility as the NF-kappa B-DNA complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore the rel-related 65-kD protein <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> represent the p65 subunit of the active NF-kappa B transcription factor complex</scope> .</sentence>
