<sentence id="0">Human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene regulation in phorbol ester stimulated T and B cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The minimal region of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) gene promoter necessary for its transcriptional induction by phorbol esters ( PMA ) in human T and B lymphocyte cell lines has been localized between -52 and +89 nucleotides ( nt ) relative to the gene 's transcriptional start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Comparison of these sequences to those required to mediate virus or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the gene reveal significant differences , and thus , the sequence requirements for PMA induction are distinct from those that mediate induction by virus or LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although three sites in the TNF-alpha promoter ( kappa 1 , kappa 2 , and kappa 3 ) specifically bind the transcription factor NF-kappa B in lymphoid nuclear extracts , TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> correlate with NF-kappa B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , kappa 1-kappa 3 can each be deleted from the TNF-alpha promoter with little effect on the gene 's inducibility by PMA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA , like its induction by virus and LPS , <scope type="neg" id="1">is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> primarily mediated by NF-kappa B</scope> , but rather is mediated through other sequences and protein factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Surprisingly , multimers of kappa 1-kappa 3 can confer PMA inducibility on a heterologous promoter in a B ( Raji ) , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> a T ( HUT78 ) cell line</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However they are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> functional on a truncated TNF-alpha promoter</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> promoter context and cell type specificity influence the PMA inducible function of these NF-kappa B binding sites</scope> .</sentence>
