<sentence id="0"><scope type="spec" id="1"> mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases and methyl-CpG-binding proteins <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> be associated with IRF-4 promoter methylation</scope></scope></sentence>
<sentence id="1">Since abundance of DNMT and MBP contribute to promoter regulation via methylation ( 25,26,28 ) , we studied their mRNA expression to investigate a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> mechanism for the observed methylation differences in the IRF-4 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To this end , we did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> detect a significant difference in DNMT ( DNMT1 , DNMT3A and DNMT3B ) or MBP ( MBD1 , MBD2 , MBD4 and MeCP ) mRNA expression between IRF-4-positive and -negative cells</scope> ( Figure 5D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In fact , all analyzed cells had moderate to high mRNA levels of these tested DNMT/MBPs and differences in expression were <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> correlated with IRF-4 status</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicate</cue> a distinct cause of the methylation differences in IRF-4-positive and -negative cells <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">rather than</cue> changes in the DNMT and MBP mRNA transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
