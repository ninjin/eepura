<sentence id="0">Lactobacilli and vaginal host defense : activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat , cytokine production , and NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lactobacilli , a component of the normal vaginal flora , can activate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) in the Jurkat T lymphocyte and THP-1 macrophage cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Activation of the LTR in Jurkat cells was strongly enhanced by vanadate and inhibited by catalase , implicating H2O2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast , activation in THP-1 cells occurred in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of vanadate</scope> and was unaffected by catalase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The active material partitioned into the phenol layer on hot aqueous phenol extraction .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Lactobacilli also increased tumor necrosis factor-alphaand interleukin-1betaproduction and activated NF-kappaB in THP-1 cells and increased tumor necrosis factor-alphaproduction by human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Human vaginal fluid specimens had comparable properties , which correlated with their bacterial content .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> the presence in vaginal fluid of agent(s) derived from indigenous bacteria that can activate the HIV-1 LTR , cytokine production , and NF-kappaB in cells of macrophage lineage , with <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> influence on vaginal physiology and host defense</scope></scope> .</sentence>
