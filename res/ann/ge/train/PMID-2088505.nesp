<sentence id="0">A novel T-cell trans-activator that recognizes a phorbol ester-inducible element of the interleukin-2 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene promoter is recognized by several cell-type-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators that integrate information transmitted by various signaling systems leading to IL-2 production and T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using a combination of transfection , protein-DNA binding , and in vitro transcription methods , we have discovered the novel T-cell-specific transcriptional activator TCF-1 ( for T-Cell Factor-1 ) , which recognizes a T-cell-specific response element ( TCE ) located within the IL-2 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although the TCE is similar in sequence to a consensus NF kappa B site , several criteria <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> TCF-1 is distinct from NF kappa B. However , like NF kappa B , TCF-1 activity is induced by phorbol esters and other T-cell activators</scope> .</sentence>
