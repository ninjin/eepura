<sentence id="1">Application of a " formamide free " and thus " material preserving " in situ hybridization technique using the cDNA of the myf3 gene revealed the following results : Human rhabdomyosarcoma cells , characterized by a high expression of myf3 show intensive hybridization signals in their interphase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">RNase treatment prior to hybridization considerably reduces the size of this signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In comparison , isolated nuclei of human lymphocytes in which <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> need for the expression of this gene exists</scope> , show barely hybridization signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Correspondingly , RNase treatment had <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on hybridization pattern at all</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In conclusion an increased transcription efficiency of a cell type specific gene is accompanied by a higher hybridization accessibility in the corresponding cell nuclei .</sentence>
