<sentence id="0">Evidence for a trans-acting activator function regulating the expression of the human CD5 antigen .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interspecies somatic cell hybrids were generated by fusing the mouse T-lymphoma cell line , BW5147 , with normal human T lymphocytes at different stages of differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Thymocytes , activated peripheral T lymphocytes , or an activated T-cell clone were used as human partners , respectively , in three independent fusions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Irrespective of the human cell partner used for fusion , a certain number of hybrids lost CD5 surface expression over a period of time in culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis at the phenotype and genetic level showed that <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of CD5 expression</scope> was due <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">neither</cue> to segregation of human autosome 11 , on which the CD5 gene has been mapped , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">nor</cue> to deletion of the CD5 structural gene</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , loss of CD5 surface expression correlated with the absence of specific mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Since these hybrids preferentially segregate human chromosomes , these results indicate the existence of a non-syntenic trans-active locus , or loci , positively controlling the expression of the human CD5 gene .</sentence>
