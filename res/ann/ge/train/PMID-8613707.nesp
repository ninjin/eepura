<sentence id="0">Transcriptional basis for hyporesponsiveness of the human inducible nitric oxide synthase gene to lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The work reported here resolves , at the level of gene regulation , the controversy as to <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether or</cue> not human monocytes/macrophages can produce nitric oxide ( NO ) when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , with or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> co-stimulation by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Studies included structural comparison of the promoters for human and mouse inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) genes , transfection and assay of human and mouse iNOS promoter regions in response to LPS +/- IFN-gamma , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays of kappa B response elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Two explanations for hyporesponsiveness of the human iNOS promoter to LPS +/- IFN-gamma were found : ( 1 ) multiple inactivating nucleotide substitutions in the human counterpart of the enhancer element that has been shown to regulate LPS/IFN-gamma induced expression of the mouse iNOS gene ; and ( 2 ) and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of one or more nuclear factors in human macrophages ( e.g. , an LPS-inducible nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel complex )</scope> , that is ( are ) required for maximal expression of the gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The importance of resolution of this controversy is that future research in this area <cue type="spec" id="3">should</cue> be directed toward the understanding of alternative mechanisms that <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">can</cue> result in the successful production of NO</scope></scope> .</sentence>
