<sentence id="0">Platelet-activating factor induces phospholipid turnover , calcium flux , arachidonic acid liberation , eicosanoid generation , and oncogene expression in a human B cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of the inflammatory response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Studies of the actions of platelet-activating factor have centered mainly around neutrophils , monocytes , and platelets .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this report we begin to uncover the influence of platelet-activating factor on B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Employing the EBV-transformed human B cell line SKW6.4 , we demonstrate that platelet-activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M. The inactive precursor , lyso-platelet-activating factor , at a concentration as high as 10(-7) M had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on any of the membrane phospholipids</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also show that platelet-activating factor from 10(-12) to 10(-6) M induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels , whereas lyso-platelet-activating factor was again ineffective .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We further demonstrate the impact of platelet-activating factor binding to B cells by measuring platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , platelet-activating factor was capable of inducing transcription of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally we explored the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> role of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation</scope> demonstrating that endogenous 5-lipoxygenase activity modulates platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">perhaps</cue> acting at the level of phospholipase A2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In summary , platelet-activating factor is shown here to have a direct and profound effect on a pure B cell line .</sentence>
