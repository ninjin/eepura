<sentence id="0">Impaired induction of c-fos/c-jun genes and of transcriptional regulatory proteins binding distinct c-fos/c-jun promoter elements in activated human T cells during aging .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The activation of transcriptional factor c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 is essential for normal T cell responsiveness and is often impaired in T cells during aging .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> aberrancies in the regulation of c-fos/c-jun at the mRNA <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> protein level <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> underlie the age-associated impairments of AP-1 in human T cells</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Whereas T cells from young subjects stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD3epsilon mAb OKT3 plus PMA or with the lectin PHA plus PMA demonstrated considerable increases in c-Fos protein expression , the expression of c-Fos but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> c-Jun</scope> was markedly reduced in stimulated T cells from certain elderly subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , RNase protection assays revealed that anti-CD3/PMA-stimulated T cells from a substantial proportion of elderly subjects exhibited decreased levels of c-fos and/or c-jun mRNA compared to T cells from young subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , the levels of nuclear regulatory proteins recognizing the AP-1 consensus TRE motif , the proximal c-jun TRE-like promoter element , and the c-fos serum response element ( SRE ) were determined in resting and stimulated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although the stimulation of T cells from young subjects resulted in coordinated increases of nuclear protein complexes binding the AP-1 TRE , c-jun TRE , and c-fos SRE DNA sequence motifs , age-related reductions in the activation of AP-1 were accompanied by decreased levels of c-jun TRE and c-fos SRE binding complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , the nuclear protein complexes binding the SRE motif induced in activated T cells of young and elderly subjects contained serum response factor and Elk-1 pointing toward age-related defects in the activation of transcriptional regulatory proteins distinct from c-jun/AP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that underlying aberrancies in the induction of c-fos/c-jun as well as their nuclear regulatory proteins <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> contribute to the age-related impairments of AP-1 activation in human T cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
