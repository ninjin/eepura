<sentence id="1">We evaluated the expression and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B subunits in human peripheral blood monocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Constitutive DNA binding activity consisting of p50 homodimers was detected in nuclear extracts from both cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An additional complex composed of p50/RelA(p65) heterodimers appeared only in nuclear extracts from 7-day MDMs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Immunoblot analysis showed that the p50 subunit was constitutively expressed in monocytes and MDMs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , the RelA(p65) subunit was barely detectable in monocytes , but its level increased markedly in MDMs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Analysis of RelA(p65) mRNA revealed that the stability of RelA(p65) mRNA was significantly higher in MDMs , compared with monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In MDMs , an upregulation of I kappa B alpha synthesis as well as the appearance of a novel M(r) 40,000 form of I kappa B alpha were also observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that macrophage differentiation results in the expression of active p50/RelA(p65) heterodimers with the capacity to activate target gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The parallel induction of I kappa B alpha synthesis <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> allow for the continuous presence of a cytoplasmic reservoir of p50/RelA(p65) complexes that are readily available for inducer-mediated stimulation</scope> .</sentence>
