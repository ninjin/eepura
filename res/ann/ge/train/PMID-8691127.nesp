<sentence id="0">Mechanisms of transactivation by nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nuclear factor of activated T cells-family proteins ( NFAT1/NFATp , NFATc , NFAT3 , and NFAT4/NFATx/NFATc3 ) play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have defined the mechanisms of transactivation by NFAT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">NFAT1 possesses two transactivation domains <scope type="neg" id="0">whose sequences are <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> conserved in the other NFAT-family proteins</scope> , and a conserved DNA-binding domain that mediates the recruitment of cooperating nuclear transcription factors even when it is expressed in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of other regions of the protein</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The activity of the NH2-terminal transactivation domain is modulated by an adjacent regulatory region that contains several conserved sequence motifs represented only in the NFAT family .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results emphasize the multiple levels at which NFAT-dependent transactivation is regulated , and predict significant differences in the architecture of cooperative transcription complexes containing different NFAT-family proteins .</sentence>
