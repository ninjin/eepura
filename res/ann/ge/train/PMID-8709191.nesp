<sentence id="0">oriP is essential for EBNA gene promoter activity in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During Epstein-Barr virus latent infection of B lymphocytes in vitro , six viral nuclear antigens ( EBNAs ) are expressed from one of two promoters , Cp or Wp , whose activities are mutually exclusive .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Upon infection , Wp is initially active , followed by a switch to Cp for the duration of latency .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , the region upstream of Cp was analyzed for the presence of cis elements involved in regulating the activities of the EBNA gene promoters in established in vitro immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It was determined that oriP , the origin for episomal maintenance during latency , is essential for efficient transcription initiation from either Cp or Wp in LCLs , as well as in some Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Deletion of the EBNA2-dependent enhancer located upstream of Cp resulted in a ca. two- to fivefold reduction in Cp activity in the LCLs assayed .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">More extensive deletion of sequences upstream of Cp , including the EBNA2-dependent enhancer , resulted in nearly complete loss of Cp activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This loss of activity was shown to correlate with deletion of two CCAAT boxes , a proximal CCAAT box located at bp -61 to -65 and a distal CCAAT box located at bp -253 to -257 , upstream of Cp. Site-directed mutagenesis of these cis elements demonstrated that Cp activity is highly dependent on the presence of a properly positioned CCAAT box , with the dependence on the distal CCAAT box apparent only when the proximal CCAAT box was deleted or mutated .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Deletion of the glucocorticoid response elements located at ca. bp -850 upstream of Cp did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> result in a significant loss in activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In general , deletions which diminished Cp activity resulted in induction of Wp activity , consistent with suppression of Wp activity by transcriptional interference from Cp. The identification of oriP and the EBNA2-dependent enhancer as the major positive cis elements involved in regulating Cp activity in LCL <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that EBNA gene transcription is largely autoregulated by EBNA 1 and EBNA 2</scope> .</sentence>
