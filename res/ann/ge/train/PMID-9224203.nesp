<sentence id="0">The role of nuclear factor-kappa B in cytokine gene regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that regulate gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is a critical transcription factor for maximal expression of many cytokines that are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases , such as adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and sepsis syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Activation and regulation of NF-kappa B are tightly controlled by a group of inhibitory proteins ( I kappa B ) that sequester NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm of immune/inflammatory effector cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">NF-kappa B activation involves signaled phosphorylation , ubiquitination , and proteolysis of I kappa B. Liberated NF-kappa B migrates to the nucleus , where it binds to specific promoter sites and activates gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The activation of NF-kappa B initiates both extracellular and intracellular regulatory events that result in autoregulation of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of NF-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Recently , activation of NF-kappa B has been linked to ARDS and has been shown to be a critical proximal step in the initiation of neutrophilic inflammation in animal models .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Activation of NF-kappa B can be inhibited in vivo by treatment with antioxidants , corticosteroids , and the induction of endotoxin tolerance .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Identification of more specific and efficacious inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> prove beneficial for the treatment of cytokine-mediated inflammatory diseases</scope> .</sentence>
