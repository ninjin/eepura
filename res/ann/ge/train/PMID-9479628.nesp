<sentence id="0">Oxidants , transcription factors , and intestinal inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It is now well appreciated that chronic gut inflammation is characterized by enhanced production of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Some of these oxidants are known to modulate the expression of a variety of genes that are involved in the immune and inflammatory responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For example , certain oxidants are known to activate the nuclear transcription factor kappa B , which regulates the expression of a variety of different adhesion molecules , cytokines , and enzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Oxidants are also known to activate another transcription factor , activator protein-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This transcription factor is composed of products from the fos and jun proto-oncogene family and <scope type="spec" id="0"> is <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be important in regulating cell growth and proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Finally , <scope type="spec" id="1"> oxidants are <cue type="spec" id="1">believed</cue> to promote intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene product is <cue type="spec" id="2">believed</cue> to inhibit this phenomenon in an antioxidant-dependent manner</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , these observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that nontoxic concentrations of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and in modulating apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
