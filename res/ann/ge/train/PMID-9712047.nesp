<sentence id="0">Cyclosporin A-resistant transactivation of the IL-2 promoter requires activity of okadaic acid-sensitive serine/threonine phosphatases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression of the IL-2 gene requires activation of T cells through stimulation of the TCR and costimulation through accessory receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have found recently that okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases are involved in a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway that selectively transmits costimulatory signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we analyzed <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> activities of these phosphatases are necessary for the expression of the IL-2 gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In both activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and activated tumorigenic T cell lines , IL-2 gene expression was blocked at the transcriptional level by okadaic acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The transcription factors active at the IL-2 promoter were differentially influenced : upon down-modulation of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases , transactivation by octamer , NF-kappa B , and NF of activated T cells proteins was abrogated , while transactivation by AP-1 proteins was even enhanced .</sentence>
