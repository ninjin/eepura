<sentence id="0">NF-kappa B activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha in the Jurkat T cell line is independent of protein kinase A , protein kinase C , and Ca(2+)-regulated kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappa B is a DNA-binding regulatory factor able to control transcription of a number of genes , including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In T cells , NF-kappa B is activated upon cellular treatment by phorbol esters and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present work , we investigated the molecular events leading to NF-kappa B activation by TNF alpha in a human T cell line ( Jurkat ) and its subclone JCT6 , which presents a deficiency in the PKA transduction pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that in both cell lines , both phorbol ester and TNF alpha were able to activate NF-kappa B. Phorbol activation was positively modulated by Ca2+ influx while TNF alpha activation was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , while PMA activation was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor staurosporin , the TNF alpha effect was unchanged .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">TNF alpha did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> activate cAMP production</scope> and <scope type="neg" id="2">its signal was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> modulated by cAMP activators</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , cAMP activators did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> activate NF-kappa B in Jurkat cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , TNF alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation was found to be mediated by <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">none</cue> of the major signal-mediating kinases such as protein kinase C ( PKC ) , protein kinase A , or Ca(2+)-regulated kinases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated NF-kappa B activation by both TNF alpha and PKC , by a mechanism that increases NF-kappa B/I kappa B dissociation <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">without</cue> affecting the NF-kappa B translocation step</scope> .</sentence>
