<sentence id="0">Immortalization of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax mutants expressed in a functional molecular clone .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transcriptional trans-activator Tax has been demonstrated to have transforming activity in multiple cell culture and transgenic-mouse models .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition to activating transcription from the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) through the cyclic AMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor ( CREB/ATF ) family of transcription factors , Tax activates the expression of multiple cellular promoters through the NF-kappaB pathway of transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The Tax mutants M22 and M47 have previously been demonstrated to selectively abrogate the ability of Tax to activate transcription through the NF-kappaB or CREB/ATF pathway , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These mutations were introduced in the tax gene of the ACH functional molecular clone of HTLV-1 , and virus produced from the mutant ACH clones was examined for the ability to replicate and immortalize primary human lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While virus derived from the clone containing the M47 mutation retained the ability to immortalize T lymphocytes , the M22 mutant lost the ability to immortalize infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> activation of the CREB/ATF pathway by Tax is dispensable for the immortalization of T cells by HTLV-1 , whereas activation of the NF-kappaB pathway <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be critical</scope></scope> .</sentence>
