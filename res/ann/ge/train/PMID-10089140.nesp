<sentence id="0">Reduction of tumour necrosis factor alpha expression and signalling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia upon treatment with desferrioxamine .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent evidence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> the rate of progression of the HIV-1 disease is significantly reduced in thalassaemia major patients upon treatment with high doses of desferrioxamine ( DFX )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The authors have previously demonstrated that in vitro exposure of mononuclear cells to DFX decreases the bioavailability of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) which has a stimulatory effect on HIV-1 replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , therefore , TNF-alpha bioavailability from mononuclear cells isolated from 10 patients with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia given DFX as compared to 10 untreated subjects has been evaluated .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Evidence is presented showing that DFX treatment reduces TNF-alpha bioavailability ( P<0.05 ) by inhibiting its steady state ( P<0.05 ) and by enhancing its inactivation through binding to soluble TNF-alpha receptor type II ( P<0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also show that DFX treatment limits the in vivo activation of NF-kappaB , a transcription factor involved in both TNF-alpha gene transcription and TNF-alpha signalling ( P<0.005 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We conclude that TNF-alpha bioavailability and signalling are impaired in patients upon DFX treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This mechanism <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> contribute to delayed progression of the HIV-1 infection in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
