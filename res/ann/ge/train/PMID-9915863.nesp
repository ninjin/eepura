<sentence id="0">Role of Egr-2 in up-regulation of Fas ligand in normal T cells and aberrant double-negative lpr and gld T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We previously identified a Fas ligand regulatory element ( FLRE ) in the Fas ligand ( fasL ) promoter that binds Egr family proteins and demonstrated that Egr-3 ( PILOT ) but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> Egr-1 ( NGFI-A , Krox-24 , Tis-8 , and Zif-268 )</scope> induces transcription of fasL .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The aberrant CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells from lpr/lpr and gld/gld mice , which have mutations in the genes encoding Fas and FasL , respectively , have an activated phenotype and constitutively express high levels of fasL mRNA , prompting us to ask what role if any the FLRE and Egr family proteins have in this aberrant expression of fasL .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Unstimulated MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gld CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells constitutively contained high levels of two proteins that bound to the FLRE .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Supershift analysis revealed these proteins to be Egr-1 and Egr-2 ( Krox-20 ) ; <scope type="neg" id="1">Egr-3 was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> detected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activation of normal lymph node cells resulted in increased expression of Egr-1 , -2 , and -3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As with egr-3 , expression of egr-2 was blocked by cyclosporin A. Although overexpressed Egr-1 was ineffective , overexpressed Egr-2 was as potent as Egr-3 in inducing fasL promoter-dependent reporter constructs in T cell hybridomas and HeLa cells , and both up-regulated endogenous fasL mRNA in HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">FasL-dependent reporter constructs in MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gld CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells were constitutively active , and this activity was largely prevented by mutation of the critical Egr family binding element .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , Egr-2 , in addition to Egr-3 , regulates FasL expression in activated normal T cells , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> Egr-2 is <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to play a direct role in aberrant fasL up-regulation in lpr/lpr and gld/gld CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells</scope> .</sentence>
