<sentence id="0">Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts encoded by the murine p105 NF-kappa B gene generates I kappa B gamma isoforms with different inhibitory activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The gene encoding the 105-kDa protein ( p105 ) precursor of the p50 subunit of transcription factor NF-kappa B also encodes a p70 I kappa B protein , I kappa B gamma , which is identical to the C-terminal 607 amino acids of p105 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that alternative RNA splicing generates I kappa B gamma isoforms with properties different from those of p70 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">One 63-kDa isoform , termed I kappa B gamma-1 , which <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> 59 amino acids C-terminal to ankyrin repeat 7</scope> , has a novel 35-amino acid C terminus encoded by an alternative reading frame of the p105 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A 55-kDa isoform , I kappa B gamma-2 , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> the 190 C-terminal amino acids of p70I kappa B gamma</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast to p70I kappa B gamma , which is a cytoplasmic protein , I kappa B gamma-1 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus , whereas I kappa B gamma-2 is predominantly nuclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The I kappa B gamma isoforms also display differences in specificity and affinity for Rel/NF-kappa B proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">While p70I kappa B gamma inhibits p50- , p65- , and c-Rel-mediated transactivation and/or DNA binding , both I kappa B gamma-1 and I kappa B gamma-2 are specific for p50 and have different affinities for this subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> in I kappa B gamma-1 and I kappa B gamma-2 of a protein kinase A site whose phosphorylation modulates p70I kappa B gamma inhibitory activity</scope> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="4"> alternative RNA splicing <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be used to generate I kappa B gamma isoforms that respond differently to intracellular signals</scope></scope> .</sentence>
