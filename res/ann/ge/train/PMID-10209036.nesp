<sentence id="1">T lymphocytes express several low molecular weight transmembrane adaptor proteins that recruit src homology (SH)2 domain-containing intracellular molecules to the cell membrane via tyrosine-based signaling motifs .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We describe here a novel molecule of this group termed SIT ( SHP2 interacting transmembrane adaptor protein ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">SIT is a disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After tyrosine phosphorylation by src and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> syk protein tyrosine kinases</scope> SIT recruits the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Overexpression of SIT in Jurkat cells downmodulates T cell receptor- and phytohemagglutinin-mediated activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) by interfering with signaling processes that are <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">probably</cue> located upstream of activation of phospholipase C</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , <scope type="neg" id="2">binding of SHP2 to SIT is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> required for inhibition of NF-AT induction</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that SIT not only regulates NF-AT activity but also controls NF-AT unrelated pathways of T cell activation involving SHP2</scope> .</sentence>
