<sentence id="0">Induction of Bcl-x(L) expression by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax through NF-kappaB in apoptosis-resistant T-cell transfectants with Tax .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to play a pivotal role in immortalization of T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have recently shown that the expression of Tax protected the mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 against apoptosis induced by interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) deprivation and converted its growth from being IL-2 dependent to being IL-2 independent .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we demonstrate that constitutive expression of bcl-xl but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> bcl-2 , bcl-xs , bak , bad , or bax</scope> was associated with apoptosis resistance after IL-2 deprivation in CTLL-2 cells that expressed Tax .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transient-transfection assays showed that bcl-x promoter was transactivated by wild-type Tax .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Similar effects were observed in mutant Tax retaining transactivating ability through NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Deletion or substitution of a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> NF-kappaB binding site identified in the bcl-x promoter</scope> significantly decreased Tax-induced transactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This NF-kappaB-like element was able to form a complex with NF-kappaB family proteins in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , Tax-induced transactivation of the bcl-x promoter was also diminished by the mutant IkappaBalpha , which specifically inhibits NF-kappaB activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that constitutive expression of Bcl-x(L) induced by Tax through the NF-kappaB pathway contributes to the inhibition of apoptosis in CTLL-2 cells after IL-2 deprivation</scope> .</sentence>
