<sentence id="0">Isolation of CD4+ T Cells and of Splenic DC and Cell Culture for T Cell Phenotype Differentiation</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T cells were sorted for CD4+CD62Lhi , CD4+CD62LhiCD25==- = = , or CD4+CD44loCD25==- = = to > 98 % on a Moflo cytometer ( Cytomation ) as before ( Shoemaker et====al. , 2006 ; Veldhoen et====al. , 2009 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In most cases , experiments were reproduced with each type of purified CD4+ T====cell population with similar results obtained .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Splenic DCs were prepared as described ( Hosken et====al. , 1995 ) , and sort purified CD11c+ cells were added to the T====cell culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Purified DO11.10 CD4+ T====cells ( 1 = = x = = 105 cells/ml ) were cultured as before ( Hosken et====al. , 1995 ) , in a total volume of 1 ml cRPMI medium in a 48-well plate , with splenic DCs ( 2 = = x = = 104 cells/ml ) , and varying amounts of OVA and of IL-12 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">APC-independent differentiation of naive CD4+ T====cells into Th1 and Th2 cells used stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and appropriate cytokine conditions , and control Th1 and Th2 cells were cultured as described before ( Hosken et====al. , 1995 ; Shoemaker et====al. , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Culture conditions for Th17 cells were as described before ( Veldhoen et====al. , 2006 ) .</sentence>
