<sentence id="0">Oncogenic forms of NOTCH1 lacking either the primary binding site for RBP-Jkappa or nuclear localization sequences retain the ability to associate with RBP-Jkappa and activate transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Truncated forms of the NOTCH1 transmembrane receptor engineered to resemble mutant forms of NOTCH1 found in certain cases of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma ( T-ALL ) efficiently induce T-ALL when expressed in the bone marrow of mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Unlike full-sized NOTCH1 , two such truncated forms of the protein either <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> a major portion of the extracellular domain ( DeltaE )</scope> or consisting only of the intracellular domain ( ICN ) were found to activate transcription in cultured cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">presumably</cue> through RBP-Jkappa response elements within DNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both truncated forms also bound to the transcription factor RBP-Jkappa in extracts prepared from human and murine T-ALL cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transcriptional activation required the presence of a weak RBP-Jkappa-binding site within the NOTCH1 ankyrin repeat region of the intracellular domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Unexpectedly , <scope type="neg" id="2">a second , stronger RBP-Jkappa-binding site , which lies within the intracellular domain close to the transmembrane region and significantly augments association with RBP-Jkappa , was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> needed for oncogenesis or for transcriptional activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">While ICN appeared primarily in the nucleus , DeltaE localized to cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that intranuclear localization is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> essential for oncogenesis or transcriptional activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In support of this interpretation , mutation of putative nuclear localization sequences decreased nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activation by membrane-bound DeltaE .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Transcriptional activation by this mutant form of membrane-bound DeltaE was approximately equivalent to that produced by intranuclear ICN .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data are most consistent with NOTCH1 oncogenesis and transcriptional activation being independent of association with RBP-Jkappa at promoter sites .</sentence>
