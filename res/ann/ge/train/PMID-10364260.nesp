<sentence id="0">Human alveolar macrophages are markedly deficient in REF-1 and AP-1 DNA binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although many functions of human alveolar macrophages are altered compared with their precursor cell , the blood monocyte ( monocyte ) , <scope type="neg" id="0">the reason(s) for these functional changes have <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been determined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We recently reported that human alveolar macrophages do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> express AP-1 DNA binding activity</scope> ( Monick , M. M. , Carter , A. B. , Gudmundsson , G. , Geist , L. J. , and Hunninghake , G. W. ( 1998 ) Am. J. Physiol .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">275 , L389-L397 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To determine why alveolar macrophages do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> express AP-1 DNA binding activity</scope> , we first showed that there was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> a decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN proteins that make up the AP-1 complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">There was , however , a significant difference in the amounts of the nuclear protein , REF-1 ( which regulates AP-1 DNA binding by altering the redox status of FOS and JUN proteins ) , in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , in vitro differentiation of monocytes to a macrophage-like cell resulted in decreased amounts of REF-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , addition of REF-1 from activated monocytes to alveolar macrophage nuclear proteins resulted in a marked increase in AP-1 DNA binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These studies strongly <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the process of differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages is associated with a loss of REF-1 and AP-1 activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This observation <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> explain , in part , some of the functional differences observed for alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes</scope> .</sentence>
