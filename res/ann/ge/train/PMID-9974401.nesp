<sentence id="0">Oleic acid inhibits endothelial activation : A direct vascular antiatherogenic mechanism of a nutritional component in the mediterranean diet .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Because oleic acid is implicated in the antiatherogenic effects attributed to the Mediterranean diet , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> this fatty acid can modulate endothelial activation , ie , the concerted expression of gene products involved in leukocyte recruitment and early atherogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We incubated sodium oleate with human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 0 to 72 hours , followed by coincubation of oleate with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor , interleukin (IL)-1alpha , IL-1beta , IL-4 , Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for a further 6 to 24 hours .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) , E-selectin , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was monitored by cell surface enzyme immunoassays or flow cytometry , and steady-state levels of VCAM-1 mRNA were assessed by Northern blot analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">At 10 to 100 micromol/L for > 24 hours , oleate inhibited the expression of all adhesion molecules tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">After a 72-hour incubation with oleate and a further 16-hour incubation with oleate plus 1 microg/mL LPS , VCAM-1 expression was reduced by > 40 % compared with control .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Adhesion of monocytoid U937 cells to LPS-treated endothelial cells was reduced concomitantly .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Oleate also produced a quantitatively similar reduction of VCAM-1 mRNA levels on Northern blot analysis and inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation on electrophoretic mobility shift assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Incubation of endothelial cells with oleate for 72 hours decreased the relative proportions of saturated ( palmitic and stearic ) acids in total cell lipids and increased the proportions of oleate in total cell lipids <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> significantly changing the relative proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Although less potent than polyunsaturated fatty acids in inhibiting endothelial activation , oleic acid <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> contribute to the prevention of atherogenesis through selective displacement of saturated fatty acids in cell membrane phospholipids and a consequent modulation of gene expression for molecules involved in monocyte recruitment</scope> .</sentence>
