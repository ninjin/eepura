<sentence id="0">Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of erythroid gene expression in anthracycline-induced differentiation of human erythroleukemic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Aclacinomycin ( ACLA ) and doxorubicin ( DOX ) were used at subtoxic concentrations to induce erythroid differentiation in the human leukemic cell line K562 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Cell hemoglobinization was accompanied by the increased expression of genes encoding gamma-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , an enzyme of heme synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By using run-on assays , ACLA was shown to induce an enhancement of the transcription of erythroid genes , including gamma-globin , PBGD , erythropoietin receptor , and GATA-1 transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , in DOX-treated cells , the transcription rate of these genes was unchanged in comparison with control cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , inhibition of mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> DOX induced an increased stability of PBGD and GATA-1 mRNAs , whereas ACLA did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affect the half-lives of these mRNAs</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Because the increase in erythroid mRNA steady-state level in anthracycline-treated cells was inhibited by cycloheximide , this <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that transcriptional activation in ACLA-treated cells and mRNA stabilization in DOX-treated cells were dependent on de novo protein synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , GATA-1 protein level was shown to be increased in ACLA-treated but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> in DOX-treated cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="4"> These two anthracyclines , although closely related in their structures , <cue type="spec" id="4">appeared</cue> to act as differentiation inducers by distinct mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Indeed , erythroid gene expression was demonstrated to be regulated transcriptionally by ACLA and mainly posttranscriptionally by DOX .</sentence>
