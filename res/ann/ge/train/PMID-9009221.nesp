<sentence id="0">Nuclear factor-kappaB activation in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide is inhibited by fibroblast conditioned medium and exogenous PGE2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be crucially involved in the gene activation of several cytokines , including tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previously , we showed that fibroblast conditioned medium ( FCM ) is able to inhibit both TNF mRNA accumulation and protein release in peripheral blood-derived human monocytes ( PBM ) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study we have investigated the effect of FCM on the LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB , by means of electrophoretic shift assay ( EMSA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We provide evidence that FCM strongly inhibits the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in PBM .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , we show that exogenous PGE2 mimics the NF-kappaB inhibitory effect of FCM .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the other hand , FCM produced in the presence of indomethacin does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> inhibit NF-kappaB activation by LPS</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results lend further support to the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesis</cue> that inflammatory and immune responses of monocytes/macrophages <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be modulated at the molecular level by signals originating from tissue structural cells such as fibroblasts</scope></scope> .</sentence>
