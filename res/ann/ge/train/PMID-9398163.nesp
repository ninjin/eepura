<sentence id="0">ATF1 and CREB trans-activate a cell cycle regulated histone H4 gene at a distal nuclear matrix associated promoter element .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Proteins of the ATF/CREB class of transcription factors stimulate gene expression of several cell growth-related genes through protein kinase A-related cAMP response elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The promoter activity of cell cycle regulated histone H4 genes is regulated by at least four principal cis-acting elements which mediate G1/S phase control and/or enhancement of transcription during the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using protein-DNA interaction assays we show that the H4 promoter contains two ATF/CREB recognition motifs which interact with CREB , ATF1 , and ATF2 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> with ATF4/CREB2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One ATF/CRE motif is located in the distal promoter at the nuclear matrix-associated Site IV , and the second motif is present in the proximal promoter at Site I. Both ATF/CRE motifs overlap binding sequences for the multifunctional YY1 transcription factor , which has previously been shown to be nuclear matrix associated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Subnuclear fractionation reveals that there are two ATF1 isoforms <scope type="spec" id="1"> which <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to differ with respect to DNA binding activity and partition selectively between nuclear matrix and nonmatrix compartments , consistent with the role of the nuclear matrix in regulating gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Site-directed mutational studies demonstrate that Site I and Site IV together support ATF1- and CREB-induced trans-activation of the H4 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , our data establish that ATF/CREB factors functionally modulate histone H4 gene transcription at distal and proximal promoter elements .</sentence>
