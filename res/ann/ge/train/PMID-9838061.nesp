<sentence id="1">The anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a are involved in the regulation of cytokine production .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study the capability of C5a and C3a to induce transcription factor activation was examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">C5a and C3a stimulation of human peripheral blood monocytes resulted in nuclear expression of a DNA binding activity with specificity to the kappaB sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The p50 and p65 proteins , constituents of the prototypic nuclear factor kappaB , were identified as components of the DNA-protein complexes by anti-peptide antibodies in gel supershift assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">C5a induced kappaB binding activity was detected 15 min after agonist stimulation , peaked at 30-40 min , and remained detectable at 2 h. Binding to kappaB sequence was accompanied by an initial decrease and subsequent increase in the cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha levels , as detected by Western blotting using an anti-IkappaBalpha antibody .</sentence>

<sentence id="7">Neither of the two toxins affected kappaB binding activity induced by TNFalpha in the same cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">imply</cue> a <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potential</cue> role of the anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a in regulating leukocytes gene expression through G protein-coupled transcription factor activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
