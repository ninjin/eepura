<sentence id="0">Expression of LAZ3/BCL6 in follicular center ( FC ) B cells of reactive lymph nodes and FC-derived non-Hodgkin lymphomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chromosomal translocation resulting in abnormal expression of the LAZ3/BCL6 gene in B cells has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore we studied the expression pattern of LAZ3/BCL6 by in situ hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotide probes in frozen tissue sections from five reactive lymph nodes and 38 B cell and non-B NHL .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , we investigated the expression of LAZ3/BCL6 by Northern blot analysis on multiple human tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The LAZ3/BCL6 transcript was found in a variety of tissues , including skeletal muscle , peripheral blood leukocytes , and weakly in normal lymph nodes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the tumor samples , expression of LAZ3/BCL6 was observed in 68 % of all B cell NHL and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">none</cue> of the non-B lymphomas</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">All cases of follicular , mixed small and large cell lymphomas showed LAZ3/BCL6 expression confined to the neoplastic follicles .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A follicular expression pattern was also found in all non-malignant reactive lymph nodes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Hence , the expression of LAZ3/BCL6 does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> correlate to malignancy</scope> , but reflects the origin of B cells from the germinal centers .</sentence>
