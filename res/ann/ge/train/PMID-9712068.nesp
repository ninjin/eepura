<sentence id="0">Inducible nitric oxide : an autoregulatory feedback inhibitor of vascular inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inducible nitric oxide ( iNO ) is produced at sites of vascular inflammation by resident and nonresident vascular wall cells , but <scope type="spec" id="0"> its role in the inflammatory process is <cue type="spec" id="0">not known</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we show that a novel function of iNO is to terminate inflammatory processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We find that iNO produced by murine macrophage-like cells , RAW264.7 , can inhibit cytokine-induced endothelial cell activation in a separated and mixed endothelial-RAW264.7 coculture system .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both iNO production and endothelial VCAM-1 expression were induced simultaneously with bacterial LPS and murine-specific IFN-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Inhibition of iNO synthase ( iNOS ) activity with N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine in endothelial-RAW264.7 cocultures , stimulated with murine-specific IFN-gamma and LPS , decreased iNO production by 86 % , augmented VCAM-1 and iNOS expression in endothelial and RAW264.7 cells , respectively , and increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transient transfection studies using various VCAM-1 promoter constructs demonstrated that inhibitory effects of iNO on VCAM-1 gene transcription were mediated , in part , by inhibitory effects of iNO on kappa B cis-acting elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Immunofluorescence studies using an Ab to the RelA ( p65 ) subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B revealed that iNO inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B. These studies <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> iNO attenuates iNOS expression in macrophages and inhibits monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that endogenously derived iNO <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be an important autoregulatory inhibitor of vascular inflammation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
