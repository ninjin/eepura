<sentence id="0">Expression of transcription factor genes after influenza A virus infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Infection of human monocytes with influenza A virus induces a broad range of proinflammatory cytokines and mononuclear cell attracting chemokines before the infected cells undergo apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The underlying mechanisms by which the corresponding genes are transcriptionally initiated after virus infection are still poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Activation of NF-kappa B <cue type="spec" id="1">seems</cue> to play an important role in the regulation of many proinflammatory cytokine genes</scope> , but cannot be the only mechanism , since several cytokine genes <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> respective binding sites in their promoter regions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Therefore , we additionally investigated other transcription factors of <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> importance</scope> such as CREB , CTF , OTF-1 , and OTF-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To explore long-term regulatory mechanisms , we investigated the induction of transcription factors on the gene expression level which <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be important to substitute for metabolized transcription factor proteins after their activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We identified a cell-type-specific differential response : CREB , CTF , OTF-1 , OFT-2 , and NF-kappa B genes were strongly induced 1 to 4 hours after influenza A virus infection in the monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 , while in freshly prepared human monocytes <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> significant changes were detected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In infected monocytes , which die by apoptosis , the expression of CREB , CTF , and OTF-2 was rather suppressed 8 hours after infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In conclusion , <scope type="spec" id="5"> the long-term regulation of transcription factor gene expression in non-proliferating cells <cue type="spec" id="5">seems</cue> to be of minor importance after influenza infection</scope> since in apoptosisprone cells an immediate availability of transcription factor proteins is required .</sentence>
