<sentence id="0">Regulation of the Ets-related transcription factor Elf-1 by binding to the retinoblastoma protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The retinoblastoma gene product ( Rb ) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this report , it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">After T cell activation , the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1 , which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This regulated interaction <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells</scope> .</sentence>
