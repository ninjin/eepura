<sentence id="0">Inhibitor ( IK ) of IFN-gamma induced HLA class II antigens expression also inhibits HLA class II constitutive expression in the human Raji B cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens is constitutive in professional antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) but can also be induced by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) on the majority of the non professional APCs ( e.g. fibroblasts ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have recently characterised a new factor called IK which is an efficient inhibitor of IFN-gamma induction of MHC class II antigens expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we demonstrate a novel role for IK in MHC class II expression since over-expression of this protein by stable transfection into human B cells led to a total disappearance of constitutive MHC class II mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) is necessary for both constitutive and IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expressions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Examination of CIITA mRNA in IK stably transfected clones revealed a marked reduction of CIITA mRNA transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together these results demonstrate that the IK protein plays a key role in the constitutive expression of MHC class II antigens and that inhibition induced by IK is upstream of CIITA in this regulatory pathway .</sentence>
