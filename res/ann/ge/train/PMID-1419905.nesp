<sentence id="0">Activation of NF-kappa B by interleukin 2 in human blood monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We report here that interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its consensus sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain ( p55 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Similarly , IL-2 activates NF-kappa B in the human monocytic cell line U 937 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in resting human T-cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This effect is detectable within 15 min and peaks 1 h after exposure to IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Enhanced NF-kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF-kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence ( -291 to -245 ) of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , IL-2 is capable of increasing transcript levels of the p50 gene coding for the p50 subunit of the NF-kappa B transcription factor , whereas mRNA levels of the p65 NF-kappa B gene remained unchanged .</sentence>
