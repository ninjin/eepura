<sentence id="0">The role of Rel/NF-kappa B proteins in viral oncogenesis and the regulation of viral transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Rel/NF-kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that consists of multiple polypeptide subunits , and is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms that involve protein-protein interactions , phosphorylation , ubiquitination , proteolytic degradation , and nucleocytoplasmic translocation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The sophisticated control of Rel/NF-kappa B activity is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> surprising</scope> since this transcription factor is involved in a wide array of cellular responses to extracellular cues , associated with growth , development , apoptosis , and pathogen invasion .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus , it is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> unexpected that <scope type="spec" id="2"> this versatile cellular homeostatic switch <cue type="spec" id="2">would</cue> be affected by a variety of viral pathogens , which have evolved mechanisms to utilize various aspects of Rel/NF-kappa B activity to facilitate their replication , cell survival and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibly</cue> evasion of immune responses</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This review will cover the molecular mechanisms that are utilized by mammalian oncogenic viruses to affect the activity of Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors and the role of Rel/NF-kappa B in the regulation of viral gene expression and replication .</sentence>
