<sentence id="0">Functional roles of the transcription factor Oct-2A and the high mobility group protein I/Y in HLA-DRA gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The class II major histocompatibility complex gene HLA-DRA is expressed in B cells , activated T lymphocytes , and in antigen-presenting cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , HLA-DRA gene expression is inducible in a variety of cell types by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2A plays a critical role in HLA-DRA gene expression in class II-positive B cell lines , and that the high mobility group protein ( HMG ) I/Y binds to multiple sites within the DRA promoter , including the Oct-2A binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Coexpression of HMG I/Y and Oct-2 in cell lines <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> Oct-2</scope> results in high levels of HLA-DRA gene expression , and in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal that HMG I/Y stimulates Oct-2A binding to the HLA-DRA promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , Oct-2A and HMG I/Y <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> synergize to activate HLA-DRA expression in B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By contrast , Oct-2A is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> involved in the IFN-gamma induction of the HLA-DRA gene in HeLa cells</scope> , but antisense HMG I/Y dramatically decreases the level of induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that distinct sets of transcription factors are involved in the two modes of HLA-DRA expression , and that HMG I/Y <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be important for B cell-specific expression</scope> , and is essential for IFN-gamma induction .</sentence>
