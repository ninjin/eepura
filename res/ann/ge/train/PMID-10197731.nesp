<sentence id="1">Nuclear Factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) is a critical regulator of several genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Treatment of T cells with a variety of stimuli , including TNF-alpha , leads to the translocation of the active p65-50 heterodimer to the nucleus , albeit at a lower level in T cells from the elderly .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate here that pretreatment with PAO results in the inhibition of NFkappaB induction in TNF-alpha treated T cells , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> a role for PAO-sensitive phosphatase in the activation of the NFkappaB via this pathway in human T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , it demonstrates that aging does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> influence the sensitivity of this phosphatase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment with DMP prior to treatment with PAO and TNF abolishes the inhibition induced by PAO , in T cells from both young and old donors , alike .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Finally , we demonstrate that a <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">failure</cue> to degrade IkappaB-alpha in cytosols of TNF-treated T cells pretreated with PAO</scope> is due to its interference with the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> due to its inhibitory effect on proteasomal degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data collectively <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that PAO interferes with the phosphorylation and the regulated degradation of IkappaB-alpha , induced by TNF , <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> affecting the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome</scope> , independent of age</scope> .</sentence>
