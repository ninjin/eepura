<sentence id="0">Induction of Mn SOD in human monocytes <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> inflammatory cytokine production by a mutant endotoxin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Endotoxin selectively induces monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> affecting levels of Cu , Zn SOD , catalase , or glutathione peroxidase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , little is known about the structure-activity relationship and the mechanism by which endotoxin induces Mn SOD .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study we demonstrated that a mutant Escherichia coli endotoxin <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacking</cue> myristoyl fatty acid at the 3' R-3-hydroxymyristate position of the lipid A moiety</scope> retained its full capacity to coagulate Limulus amoebocyte lysate compared with the wild-type E. coli endotoxin and markedly stimulated the activation of human monocyte nuclear factor-kappaB and the induction of Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , in contrast to the wild-type endotoxin , it <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">failed</cue> to induce significant production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha by monocytes</scope> and did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggest</cue> that 1 ) lipid A myristoyl fatty acid , although it is important for the induction of inflammatory cytokine production by human monocytes , is <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> necessary for the induction of Mn SOD</scope> , 2 ) endotoxin-mediated induction of Mn SOD and inflammatory cytokines are regulated , at least in part , through different signal transduction pathways , and 3 ) <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">failure</cue> of the mutant endotoxin to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha production</scope> is , at least in part , due to its inability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase</scope> .</sentence>
