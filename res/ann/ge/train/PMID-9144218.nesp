<sentence id="0">An enhancer-blocking element between alpha and delta gene segments within the human T cell receptor alpha/delta locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T cell receptor ( TCR ) alpha and delta gene segments are organized within a single genetic locus but are differentially regulated during T cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">An enhancer-blocking element ( BEAD-1 , for blocking element alpha/delta 1 ) was localized to a 2.0-kb region 3' of TCR delta gene segments and 5' of TCR alpha joining gene segments within this locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">BEAD-1 blocked the ability of the TCR delta enhancer ( Edelta ) to activate a promoter when located between the two in a chromatin-integrated construct .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that BEAD-1 functions as a boundary that separates the TCR alpha/delta locus into distinct regulatory domains controlled by Edelta and the TCR alpha enhancer , and that it prevents Edelta from opening the chromatin of the TCR alpha joining gene segments for VDJ recombination at an early stage of T cell development</scope> .</sentence>
