<sentence id="0">The ubiquitous octamer-binding protein(s) is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">All immunoglobulin genes contain a conserved octanucleotide promoter element , ATGCAAAT , which has been shown to be required for their normal B-cell-specific transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Proteins that bind this octamer have been purified , and cDNAs encoding octamer-binding proteins have been cloned .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Some of these proteins ( referred to as OTF-2 ) are lymphoid specific , whereas at least one other , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> more</scope> ( referred to as OTF-1 ) , is found ubiquitously in all cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The exact role of these different proteins in directing the tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes is <cue type="spec" id="1">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have identified two human pre-B-cell lines that contain extremely low levels of OTF-2 yet still express high levels of steady-state immunoglobulin heavy-chain mRNA in vivo and efficiently transcribe an immunoglobulin gene in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Addition of a highly enriched preparation of OTF-1 made from one of these pre-B cells or from HeLa cells specifically stimulated in vitro transcription of an immunoglobulin gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , <scope type="spec" id="2"> OFT-1 <cue type="spec" id="2">appeared</cue> to have approximately the same transactivation ability as OTF-2 when normalized for binding activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that OTF-1 , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> OTF-2</scope> , is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes and that OTF-2 alone is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> responsible for the B-cell-specific regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
