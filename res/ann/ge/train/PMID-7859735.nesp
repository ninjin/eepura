<sentence id="0">Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of human leukemic cells is caused by the repressive function of the glucocorticoid receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes , which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in various diseases including leukemia</scope> , depends on the glucocorticoid receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="neg" id="1">the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A prevailing <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesis</cue> postulates induction of so-called ' lysis genes ' by the activated receptor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we show that an activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant is as effective as the wild-type receptor in repression of AP-1 activity , inhibition of interleukin-2 production , inhibition of c-myc expression and induction of apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor , whose repressive functions but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> target site specificity</scope> , are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">rather than</cue> activation</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival</scope> .</sentence>
