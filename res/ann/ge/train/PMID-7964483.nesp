<sentence id="0">One gene , two transcripts : isolation of an alternative transcript encoding for the autoantigen La/SS-B from a cDNA library of a patient with primary Sjogrens ' syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A cDNA library was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of an autoimmune patient with primary Sjogrens ' syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The cDNA library was screened with the patients own autoimmune serum being monospecific for the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thereby an alternative type of La mRNA was identified that differed from the known La mRNA due to an exchange of the exon 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sequencing of the genomic region between the exons 1 and 2 showed that the alternative 5'-end is a part of the intron .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , the presence of an alternative promoter site , which exists within the intron downstream of the exon 1 , became evident .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In consequence , the alternative La mRNA is the result of a promoter switching combined with an alternative splicing mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the intron , further transcription factor binding sites , including a NF-kappa B element , were identified leading to the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggestion</cue> that the expression of the gene encoding for the nuclear autoantigen La/SS-B alters in dependence on disease conditions</scope> .</sentence>
