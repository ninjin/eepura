<sentence id="0">Selective activation and functional significance of p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of leukocytes by proinflammatory stimuli selectively initiates intracellular signal transduction via sequential phosphorylation of kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of human neutrophils is known to result in activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPk ) ; however , the upstream activator(s) of p38 MAPk is unknown , and consequences of p38 MAPk activation remain largely undefined .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We investigated the MAPk kinase ( MKK ) that activates p38 MAPk in response to LPS , the p38 MAPk isoforms that are activated as part of this pathway , and the functional responses affected by p38 MAPk activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although MKK3 , MKK4 , and MKK6 all activated p38 MAPk in experimental models , only MKK3 was found to activate recombinant p38 MAPk in LPS-treated neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Of p38 MAPk isoforms studied , only p38alpha and p38delta were detected in neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">LPS stimulation selectively activated p38alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Specific inhibitors of p38alpha MAPk blocked LPS-induced adhesion , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) activation , and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Inhibition of p38alpha MAPk resulted in a transient decrease in TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation but persistent loss of TNF-alpha synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">support</cue> a pathway by which LPS stimulation of neutrophils results in activation of MKK3</scope> , which in turn activates p38alpha MAPk , ultimately regulating adhesion , NF-kappaB activation , enhanced gene expression of TNF-alpha , and regulation of TNF-alpha synthesis .</sentence>
