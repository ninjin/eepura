<sentence id="0">Thymocyte-thymic epithelial cell interaction leads to high-level replication of human immunodeficiency virus exclusively in mature CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(+) thymocytes : a critical role for tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">This work aims at identifying the thymocyte subpopulation able to support human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication under the biological stimuli of the thymic microenvironment .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this report we demonstrate that interaction with thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) induces a high-level replication of the T-tropic primary isolate HIV-1(B-LAIp) exclusively in the mature CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(+) thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) , secreted during this interaction , are critical cytokines for HIV long terminal repeat transactivation through NF-kappaB-dependent activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TNF is the major inducer of NF-kappaB and particularly of the p50-p65 complex , whereas IL-7 acts as a cofactor by sustaining the expression of the p75 TNF receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The requirement for TNF is further confirmed by the observation that the inability of the intermediate CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(-) thymocytes to replicate the virus is associated with a defect in TNF production during their interaction with TEC and correlates with the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in these freshly isolated thymocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Addition of exogenous TNF to the intermediate thymocyte cultures induces NF-kappaB activity and is sufficient to promote HIV replication in the cocultures with TEC .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The other major subpopulation expressing the CD4 receptor , namely , the double-positive ( DP ) CD4(+) CD8(+) CD3(+/-) thymocytes , despite the entry of the virus , do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> produce a significant level of virus</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">presumably</cue> because they are unresponsive to TNF and IL-7</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , these data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that in vivo , despite an efficient entry of the virus in all the CD4(+) subpopulations , <scope type="spec" id="4"> a high viral load <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be generated exclusively within the mature CD4(+) CD8(-) CD3(+) subset of thymocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , under conditions of inflammatory response after infection , TNF <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">might</cue> also be present in the intermediate thymocyte compartment , leading to efficient HIV replication in these cells</scope> .</sentence>
