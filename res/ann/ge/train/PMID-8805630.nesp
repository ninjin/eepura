<sentence id="0">Multifactor cis-dominant negative regulation of IL-2 gene expression in anergized T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="neg" id="0">The molecular mechanism underlying IL-2 transcriptional blockade in anergic T cell clones is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> fully understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To examine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> an active negative regulatory process occurs</scope> , we created a reporter construct containing as an enhancer four copies of the NF-AT site and one copy of the octamer site ( 4X NF-AT-Oct ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This construct was only slightly reduced ( 1.3-fold ) in its expression when stimulated under anergic conditions , while a whole mouse IL-2 enhancer construct showed a reduction of 4.3-fold .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Addition of the -176 to -96 sequence to the 4X NF-AT-Oct construct did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> impart the ability to be affected by anergy</scope> , but addition of the -236 to -96 sequence did , demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the -150 AP-1 binding site ( -152 to -147 ) is required to mediate the effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutational studies of the -236 to -96 sequence <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> the presence of both the -130 AP-1-like site ( -187 to -181 ) and the -150 proximal AP-1 site were necessary to observe anergy</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Because <scope type="neg" id="4">the -180 site is <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> required for trans-activation</scope> , it was <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possible</cue> to confirm by mutation in the normal mouse IL-2 enhancer that this site is absolutely essential for anergy induction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The simplest model to explain these results is that anergy is mediated by a complex of multiple transcription factors that exert a cis-acting dominant negative regulatory effect on the trans-activation of the IL-2 gene .</sentence>
