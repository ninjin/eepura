<sentence id="0">Cell-specific expression of helix-loop-helix transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The E2A gene encodes transcription factors of the helix-loop-helix family that are implicated in cell-specific gene expression as part of dimeric complexes that interact with E box enhancer elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has previously been shown that transcripts of the E2A gene can be detected in a wide range of cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have now examined expression of the mouse E2A gene at the protein level using polyclonal antisera directed against distinct portions of the E2A protein to probe blots of cellular extracts .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A 73 kDa protein was identified by this analysis : this protein is highly enriched in cell lines of B lymphoid origin as compared to pancreatic beta-cells and fibroblast cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The detection of this protein selectively in extracts of lymphoid cells correlates with the presence of the E box-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 in these cells ; this binding activity was previously shown to be efficiently recognized by antiserum directed against E2A gene products .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transfection of cells with full length E2A cDNA leads to appearance of protein co-migrating with the 73 kDa protein on SDS gel electrophoresis and co-migrating with LEF1/BCF1 on mobility shift analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results are consistent with the view that the DNA-binding activity LEF1/BCF1 is a homodimer of E2A proteins ; <scope type="spec" id="1"> the selective appearance of this <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> cell-specific transcription factor</scope> in B lymphoid cells <cue type="spec" id="1">seems</cue> to be attributable , at least in part , to the elevated E2A protein concentrations in these cells</scope> .</sentence>
