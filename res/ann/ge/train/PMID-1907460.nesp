<sentence id="0">Inhibition of HIV-1 replication and NF-kappa B activity by cysteine and cysteine derivatives .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">HIV-1 proviral DNA contains two binding sites for the transcription factor NF-kappa B. HIV-1-infected individuals have , on average , abnormally high levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) and abnormally low plasma cysteine levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We therefore investigated the effects of cysteine and related thiols on HIV-1 replication and NF-kappa B expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The experiments in this report show that cysteine or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) raise the intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) level and inhibit HIV-1 replication in persistently infected Molt-4 and U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , inhibition of HIV-1 replication appears <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> to be directly correlated with GSH levels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Cysteine and NAC also inhibit NF-kappa B activity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase ( CAT ) gene expression under control of NF-kappa B binding sites in uninfected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that the cysteine deficiency in HIV-1-infected individuals <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> cause an over-expression of NF-kappa B-dependent genes and enhance HIV-1 replication</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="3"> NAC <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be considered for the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals</scope> .</sentence>
