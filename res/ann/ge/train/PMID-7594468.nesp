<sentence id="0">Regulation of IkB alpha phosphorylation by PKC- and Ca(2+)-dependent signal transduction pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin , a target of FK506 and CsA , synergizes with PKC-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B in T cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> this synergy is present in other cell types and the mechanism(s) by which these two pathways lead to NF-kappa B activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While this synergy is present in other cell types , in the monocytic cell line U937 calcineurin is also sufficient to activate NF-kappa B. Having previously shown that Ca(2+)- and PKC-dependent pathways synergize by accelerating the degradation of IkB alpha , we focused on the regulation of IkB alpha phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">While PKC-dependent pathways sequentially result in the phosphorylation and in an incomplete degradation of IkB alpha in T cell lines , co-activation of Ca(2+)-dependent pathways accelerates the rate of IkB alpha phosphorylation and results in its complete degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activation of Ca(2+)-dependent pathways alone do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> result in the phosphorylation and/or degradation of IkB alpha in Jurkat T or in U937 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Treatment of T cells with the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X abrogates the PMA-induced IkB alpha phosphorylation/degradation irrespective of activation of Ca(2+)-dependent pathways , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB alpha induced by TNF-alpha , a PKC-independent stimulus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Contrary to the interaction with PKC , Ca(2+)-dependent pathways synergize with TNF-alpha not at the level of IkB alpha phosphorylation , but at the level of its degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> Ca(2+)-dependent pathways , including the phosphatase calcineurin , participate in the regulation of NF-kappa B in a cell specific fashion and synergize with PKC-dependent and -independent pathways at the level of IkB alpha phosphorylation and degradation</scope> .</sentence>
