<sentence id="0">Oxidant-regulation of gene expression in the chronically inflamed intestine .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It is becoming increasingly apparent that the chronic gut inflammation observed in the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases ( e.g. ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) is associated with enhanced production of leukocyte-derived oxidants .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide are known to activate certain transcription factors such as nuclear transcription factor kappa beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Nuclear transcription factor kB ( NF-kappa B ) is a ubiquitous transcription factor and pleiotropic regulator of numerous genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This transcription factor is activated via the selective phosphorylation , ubiquination and degradation of its inhibitor protein I-kB thereby allowing translocation of NF-kappa B into the nucleus where it upregulates the transcription of a variety of adhesion molecules ( e.g. ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 ) , cytokines ( TNF , IL-1 , IL-6 ) and enzymes ( iNOS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The proteolytic degradation of the post-translationally modified I-kappa B is known to be mediated by the 26S proteasome complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Based upon work from our laboratory , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that inhibition of NF-kappa B activation produces significant anti inflammatory activity <scope type="spec" id="1"> which <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be mediated by the inhibition of transcription of certain pro-inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules</scope></scope> .</sentence>
