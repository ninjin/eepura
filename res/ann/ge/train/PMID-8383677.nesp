<sentence id="0">Stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta production in human monocytes by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In human monocytes , the inhibitors of these phosphatases , okadaic acid and calyculin A , were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-1 alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The increased mRNA accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the interleukin-1 genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Stimulation of interleukin-1 gene transcription <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be caused by the stimulation of transcription factor activities , including those of AP-1 , by these protein phosphatase inhibitors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Okadaic acid increased the synthesis of the interleukin-1 beta precursor and mature forms and their secretion .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of IL-1 beta convertase mRNA accumulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of interleukin-1 beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , the phosphorylation of the precursor interleukin-1 alpha cytokine was increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in human monocytes and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that these two phosphatases play important roles in regulating interleukin-1 production</scope> .</sentence>
