<sentence id="0">[ Regulation of transcription of the interleukin-2 gene in B-lymphocytes ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Since most B cell clones immortalized with EBV virus <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> be induced to produce interleukin-2 , a typical T cell cytokine</scope> , we studied the role of different elements of the IL-2 promoter in such clones by transfection .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It was found , in particular , that the element TCEd , which binds the transcription factor NF-kB , is very active in all three B clones tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This element has <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> activity in T cells of the Jurkat line</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The NFATd element , which binds the transcription factor NFAT-1 and is very active in T cells , is only weakly active in one B clone and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> at all in another</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Different elements thus contribute to IL-2 promoter activity in different cells .</sentence>
