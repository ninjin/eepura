<sentence id="0">A novel SP-1 site in the human interleukin-1 beta promoter confers preferential transcriptional activity in keratinocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) in non-monocytic cells , we constructed a series of reporter plasmids with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to various parts of the human IL-1beta promoter and performed transient transfection experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We identified a promoter segment that activates transcription most efficiently in keratinocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) with a 43-mer oligonucleotide derived from the functionally identified cis-acting element revealed specific complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By competition analysis with transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by immunosupershift , <scope type="spec" id="0"> transcription factor SP-1 <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> a closely related protein</scope> was shown to bind to this regulatory element .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The closest match to the known SP-1 consensus sequence within the respective region is a TCCCCTCCCCT motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutation of this motif almost completely , and specifically , abolished the binding of two low-mobility complexes and led to a 95 % decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct IL-1beta ( -170/+108 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Likewise , activation of this reporter construct by tumor necrosis factor-alpha depended on the SP-1 site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These observations <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that a so-far-unrecognized SP-1 site in the human IL-1beta promoter <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in keratinocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
