<sentence id="0">Effects of glucocorticoids on transcription factor activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on inflammatory and immune responses , and this <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be through the modulation of transcription factor binding to DNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The interaction of the transcription factors , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , and cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) with DNA and glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gel mobility shift assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TNF-alpha , IL-1 beta and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) treatment increased AP-1 and NF kappa B DNA binding by up to 200 % but decreased CREB binding ( 38 % ) over a 60-min time course .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in glucocorticoid response element binding and a concomitant 40-50 % decrease in AP-1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and cytokine or PMA treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of GR , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> to reduced amounts of the other transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that in these cells GR within the nucleus interacts with cytokine-stimulated transcription factors by the process of cross coupling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be an important molecular site of steroid action</scope> .</sentence>
