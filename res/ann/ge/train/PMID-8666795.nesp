<sentence id="0">Induction of CIITA and modification of in vivo HLA-DR promoter occupancy in normal thymic epithelial cells treated with IFN-gamma : similarities and distinctions with respect to HLA-DR-constitutive B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this study , the IFN-gamma induction of MHC class II gene expression in primary cultures of thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) was analyzed .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This cellular system offers the advantage that MHC class II induction is studied in a " physiologic " cell lineage that , as a result of this expression within the thymus , <scope type="spec" id="0"> is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to participate to the selection and maturation of the T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It was found that the MHC class II gene expression was associated with the de novo transcription of the gene encoding the CIITA trans-activator , a crucial MHC class II gene regulatory factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , the anatomy of interaction between the MHC class II DRA promoter and corresponding binding factors was analyzed by in vivo DNAse I footprint .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It was found that treatment with IFN-gamma induces changes in the occupancy of the DRA gene regulatory sequences by nuclear factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The resulting occupancy displays strong similarities with the one observed in the MHC class II-constitutive B cells , represented by both the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji and normal tonsil- derived B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , some peculiar differences were observed between the TEC , either IFN-gamma-induced or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> , and the constitutive B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that both common mechanisms , such as the one mediated by the CIITA trans-activator , and distinct tissue-specific constraints contribute to the transcriptional control of constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
