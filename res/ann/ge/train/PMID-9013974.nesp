<sentence id="0">Inhibitory effect of growth hormone on TNF-alpha secretion and nuclear factor-kappaB translocation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several studies have pointed to a link between immune and endocrine systems , including a regulatory function of GH on monocyte activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The present study demonstrates that human THP-1 promonocytic cells , engineered by gene transfer to constitutively produce human growth hormone ( hGH ) , secreted depressed amounts of TNF-alpha in response to challenge by LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The effect of GH <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to occur in an autocrine fashion</scope> , since <scope type="spec" id="1"> the inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha secretion by constitutive GH production <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> be abolished in the presence of anti-hGH mAb</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The GH-induced inhibitory effect was also observed using normal human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Inhibition of TNF-alpha production by THP-1-hGH-transfected cells cultured in the presence of LPS is dependent on a selective pathway , since <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> inhibition of TNF-alpha production was observed when cells were cultured in the presence of PMA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inhibition of TNF-alpha secretion by LPS-stimulated THP-1-hGH cells was associated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The capacity of GH to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by monocytes <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> altering other pathways leading to TNF-alpha production</scope> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be of <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">potential</cue> relevance in septic shock</scope></scope> , since GH is available for clinical use .</sentence>
