<sentence id="0">The B cell-specific nuclear factor OTF-2 positively regulates transcription of the human class II transplantation gene , DRA .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The promoter of the major histocompatibility class II gene DRA contains an octamer element ( ATTTGCAT ) that is required for efficient DRA expression in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several DNA-binding proteins are known to bind this sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The best characterized are the B cell-specific OTF-2 and the ubiquitous OTF-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This report directly demonstrates that OTF-2 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> OTF-1</scope> regulates the DRA gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In vitro transcription analysis using protein fractions enriched for the octamer-binding protein OTF-2 demonstrate a positive functional role for OTF-2 in DRA gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , OTF-1-enriched protein fractions did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect DRA gene transcription</scope> although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Recombinant OTF-2 protein produced by in vitro transcription/translation <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> also enhance DRA gene transcription in vitro</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In vivo transient transfection studies utilizing an OTF-2 expression vector resulted in similar findings : that OTF-2 protein enhanced DRA gene transcription , and that this effect requires an intact octamer element .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Together these results constitute the first direct evidence of a positive role for the lymphoid-specific octamer-binding factor in DRA gene transcription .</sentence>
