<sentence id="0">GATA transcription factors associate with a novel class of nuclear bodies in erythroblasts and megakaryocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The nuclear distribution of GATA transcription factors in murine haemopoietic cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Specific bright foci of GATA-1 fluorescence were observed in erythroleukaemia cells and primary murine erythroblasts and megakaryocytes , in addition to diffuse nucleoplasmic localization .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These foci , which were preferentially found adjacent to nucleoli or at the nuclear periphery , did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> represent sites of active transcription or binding of GATA-1 to consensus sites in the beta-globin loci</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of intensely labelled structures <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to represent the GATA-1 foci seen by immunofluorescence</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The GATA-1 nuclear bodies differed from previously described nuclear structures and there was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> co-localization with nuclear antigens involved in RNA processing or other ubiquitous ( Spl , c-Jun and TBP ) or haemopoietic ( NF-E2 ) transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , GATA-2 and GATA-3 proteins also localized to the same nuclear bodies in cell lines co-expressing GATA-1 and -2 or GATA-1 and -3 gene products .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This pattern of distribution is , thus far , unique to the GATA transcription factors and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> a protein-protein interaction with other components of the nuclear bodies via the GATA zinc finger domain</scope> .</sentence>
