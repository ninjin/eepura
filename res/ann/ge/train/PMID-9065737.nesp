<sentence id="0">Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During the course of serious bacterial infections , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) interacts with monocyte/macrophage receptors , resulting in the generation of inflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transcription factor NF-kappaB is crucial in activating the transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this paper , we demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappaB by LPS in a promonocytic cell line ( U937 ) followed a rather slow kinetics , depending on the rate of IkappaB-alpha inhibitor hydrolysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">No</cue> degradation of p105 and p100 inhibitors was observed under these conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The transduction pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells involved the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , as demonstrated by the concomitant inhibitory effects of antioxidants on NF-kappaB activation and the emission of a fluorescent probe reacting intracellularly with hydrogen peroxide .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This ROS pathway was also characterized by the use of other inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This finding <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates that</cue> phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase are also involved</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <scope type="neg" id="2">the NF-kappaB activation pathway involving the acidic sphingomyelinase of the endolysosomial membrane did <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="3">seem</cue> to participate in the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in U937 cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
