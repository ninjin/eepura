<sentence id="0">The expression of c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc genes is regulated by heat shock in human lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The effect of heat shock on the expression of the nuclear protooncogenes c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc was studied in human lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Heat shock caused an increase in c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels and a decrease in c-myc mRNA levels in pre-B ( Hyon ) and T ( DND-41 ) cell lines as well as in freshly isolated normal human thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The changes in the mRNA levels of these protooncogenes in Hyon cells were most pronounced at 42 and 43 degrees C ; kinetic analysis demonstrated that the changes could be detected within 30 min of heat shock .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Altered transcription of c-fos and c-myc genes was the primary effect of heat shock .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Secondarily , heat shock of Hyon cells stabilized the c-myc mRNA level by increasing its half-life from 24 to 45 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The overall effect of heat shock on c-myc mRNA level , however , was a marked inhibition of its transcription .</sentence>
