<sentence id="0">RP1 , a new member of the adenomatous polyposis coli-binding EB1-like gene family , is differentially expressed in activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cross-linking of the CD3 and CD28 molecules on T lymphocytes represents one of the most effective signals for T lymphocyte activation and triggering of their cytotoxic effector function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To identify genes that are expressed in T cells after stimulation , mRNA from T lymphocytes that had been activated by the simultaneous stimulation of the CD3 and CD28 trigger molecules was transcribed for a differential mRNA display analysis into cDNA and was compared with cDNA from CD28- or CD3-activated or resting lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Differential expression was confirmed subsequently by Northern blot analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One of the cDNA fragments expressed specifically in CD3- and CD28-activated T cells was designated RP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The predictive protein-coding region of RP1 had a significant homology to members of the recently found adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) protein-binding EB1 gene family , which codes for yet <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> protein(s)</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Bacterially expressed RP1 protein revealed specific binding to wild-type but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> to mutated APC protein</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The rapid up-regulation of RP1 mRNA in properly activated T cells <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that this gene <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> belong to the immediate/early gene family , which controls the signal transduction cascade downstream of the TCR</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">As the expression level of the RP1 gene in activated T cells and a spectrum of tumor-derived cell lines correlates with the proliferative status of the cells , members of the EB1-like gene family <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> not only be involved in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancers</scope> but <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> also play a role in the proliferative control of normal cells</scope> .</sentence>
