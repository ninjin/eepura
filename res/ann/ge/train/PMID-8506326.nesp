<sentence id="0">Molecular basis of a multiple lymphokine deficiency in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously reported that the T lymphocytes of a child with severe combined immunodeficiency are defective in the transcription of several lymphokine genes that include IL2 , IL3 , IL4 , and IL5 , which encode interleukins 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ( IL-2 , -3 , -4 , and -5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the defect in the patient 's T lymphocytes involved a trans-acting factor common to the affected lymphokine genes</scope> , we examined the ability of nuclear factors from the patient 's T lymphocytes to bind response elements present in the regulatory region of IL2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Nuclear factor NF-kB , activation protein 1 ( AP-1 ) , OCT-1 , and NF-IL-2B binding activity were normal .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , the binding of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) to its response element in the IL2 enhancer and to an NF-AT-like response element present in the IL4 enhancer was abnormal .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To ascertain <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the abnormal NF-AT binding activity was related to an impaired function</scope> , we transfected patient and control T lymphocytes with constructs containing the reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) under the control of the entire IL2 regulatory region or of multimers of individual enhancer sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CAT expression directed by the IL2 regulatory region or by a multimer of the NF-AT-binding site was markedly lower in the patient relative to controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , CAT gene expression directed by a multimer of the OCT-1 proximal (OCT-1p)-binding site was equivalent in patient and controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> an abnormality of/or influencing NF-AT <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> underlie the multiple lymphokine deficiency in this patient</scope></scope> .</sentence>
