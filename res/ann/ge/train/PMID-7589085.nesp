<sentence id="0">CD30 ligation induces nuclear factor-kappa B activation in human T cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD30 is a recently described member of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this report , we show that following incubation of L540 cells ( Hodgkin 's disease-derived , T cell-like , CD30+ cells ) with the agonistic anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) M44 and M67 , two nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B DNA binding activities were induced in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel retardation assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The effect of the mAb towards NF-kappa B activation was rapid , as it occurred within 20 min , and was sustained for up to 6 h. By comparison , an isotype-matched antibody had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on NF-kappa B activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , in human T helper ( Th ) clones functionally characterized as being of the type 0 , type 1 and type 2 ( 28 % , < 1 % und 93 % CD30+ , respectively ) , the extent of CD30-mediated NF-kappa B activation correlated with the proportion of CD30+ cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In all cell lines investigated , the NF-kappa B complexes induced following CD30 engagement were shown to contain p50 NF-kappa B1 , p65 RelA , and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> other transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Collectively , our results demonstrate that nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kappa B rank among the short-term cellular responses elicited following CD30 ligation .</sentence>
