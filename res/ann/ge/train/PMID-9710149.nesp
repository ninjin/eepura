<sentence id="0">Dimethyldithiocarbamate inhibits in vitro activation of primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Dithiocarbamates ( DTC ) , a diverse group of industrial and therapeutic chemicals , have been reported to inhibit , enhance or have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on the immune system</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These apparent inconsistencies reflect the complexity of the DTCs biological activities and are <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">probably</cue> due in part to differences in dose , route of exposure , animal species used and/or specific compound tested</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The studies described herein were undertaken to investigate the immunotoxicity of one member of this family , dimethyldithiocarbamate ( DMDTC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We demonstrate that 0.1-0.5 microM DMDTC inhibits TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB in primary human CD4+ T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="2">This inhibition is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> accompanied by a loss in viability</scope> , and DMDTC-treated T cells retain other active signaling pathways throughout the exposure duration .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The inhibition of NF-kappaB is apparently permanent as DMDTC-treated T cells did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> regain normal TNF-alpha activation , even after 72 h in culture</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="6"> DMDTC does <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="6">appear</cue> to alter NF-kappaB directly</scope></scope> as pre-incubation of nuclear extracts with DMDTC does <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> diminish binding activity of this protein</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We further demonstrate that 0.1-0.5 microM DMDTC inhibits intracellular IL-2 production and decreases surface expression of CD25 ( the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor ) in T cells stimulated with phorbol ester .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data demonstrate that DMDTC is a potent immunosuppressive compound in vitro .</sentence>
