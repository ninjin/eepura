<sentence id="0">Methylation-sensitive enzymes do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> cut specific sites in the IRF-4 promoter in hematopoietic cells</scope></sentence>
<sentence id="1">To further investigate promoter methylation as a regulatory mechanism of IRF-4 gene expression , restriction-PCR-assays were performed ( 20,24 ) , where <scope type="spec" id="2"> only methylated DNA <cue type="spec" id="2">would</cue> <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> be cut enabling subsequent PCR amplification and vice versa</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Genomic DNA from leukemic cells Jurkat , CML-T1 , U-937 , K-562 , EM-2 and BV-173 was digested with the methylation-sensitive enzymes HpaII , Bsh1236I and HaeII-isochizomer Bsp143II .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">EcoRI , which has <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> recognition site within the IRF-4 promoter</scope> , and the methylation-resistant enzyme MspI served as controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Two separate amplification reactions were performed , generating two fragments , F1 and F2 ( Figure 3A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">After digestion with HpaII and Bsp143II a sufficient PCR amplification of F1 and F2 was detected in DNA from IRF-4-negative Jurkat , CML-T1 , U-937 , K-562 and EM-2 cells , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> a promoter methylation ( and restriction protection ) at the respective recognition sites ( Figure 3B and C )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Notably , in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells digestion with the methylation-sensitive enzymes completely inhibited amplification of F1 and F2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In IRF-4-positive BV-173 cells a HpaII , but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> a Bsh1236I digestion</scope> , significantly reduced the amplifiable DNA message of F2 ( Figure 3C ) , whereas <scope type="neg" id="6">amplification of F1 was <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> affected</scope> ( Figure 3B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">implied</cue> that IRF-4 transcription in SD-1 and BV-173 cells is associated with less promoter methylation ( in BV-173 especially at HpaII sites ) as compared with the tested IRF-4-negative cells</scope> .</sentence>
