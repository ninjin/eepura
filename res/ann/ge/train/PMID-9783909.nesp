<sentence id="0">Differential RNA display identifies novel genes associated with decreased vitamin D receptor expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To characterize further the function of the intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , we have developed stable transfectant variants of a vitamin D-responsive cell line ( U937 ) which express either decreased or increased numbers of VDR .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study we have analyzed changes in gene expression associated with this variable VDR expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Initial experiments <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> a 50 % decrease in VDR levels was associated with a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation and a similar rise in c-myc mRNA expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Further studies were carried out using differential RNA display ( DD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sequence analysis of DD products revealed two cDNAs with identity to known gene products : the catalytic sub-unit of DNA-protein kinase ( DNA-PK(CS) ) , and the peroxisomal enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV ( 17beta-HSD IV ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Northern analysis confirmed that expression of both mRNAs was reduced in cells with decreased numbers of VDR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Down-regulation of 17beta-HSD IV mRNA expression was associated with enhanced estradiol inactivation by U937 cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a link between estrogenic pathways and cell proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Further Northern analyses <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> there was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> significant change in 17beta-HSD IV or DNA-PK(CS) mRNA levels following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3</scope> , although expression of both genes varied with changes in cell proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that , in addition to its established role as a hormone-dependent trans-activator , VDR <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> influence gene expression by ligand-independent mechanisms</scope></scope> .</sentence>
