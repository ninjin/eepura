<sentence id="0">NF-kappa B/Rel family members regulating the ICAM-1 promoter in monocytic THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A kappa B-site was identified in the promoter of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) gene , which is involved in regulation of ICAM-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and glucocorticoids .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now report on the transcription factors which bind and transactivate this enhancer sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In vitro , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the ICAM-1 kappa B site <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to bind RelA and c-Rel homodimers as well as heterodimers with NF-kappa B1 , but weakly NF-kappa B1 homodimers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , both RelA and c-Rel , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> NF-kappa B1</scope> , were shown to transactivate an ICAM-1 kappa B-reporter construct .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In monocytic THP-1 cells TNF-alpha induced two nuclear complexes which in vitro bound to the ICAM-1 kappa B site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using antibodies in an electrophoretic mobility supershift assay , one of these complexes was shown to contain NF-kappa B1 and RelA , and to bind with higher affinity to the consensus kappa B site in the HIV long terminal repeat .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The second complex contained RelA , and exhibited higher affinity towards the ICAM-1 kappa B than to the HIV kappa B site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The glucocorticoid receptor was shown to repress activity of both the RelA homodimer and the NF-kappa B1/RelA heterodimer .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We argue that in vivo <scope type="spec" id="2"> RelA homodimers are <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to play a dominant role in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 transcription in monocytic cells</scope> .</sentence>
