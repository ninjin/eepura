<sentence id="0">Identification of a novel factor that interacts with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain promoter and stimulates transcription in conjunction with the lymphoid cell-specific factor OTF2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The tissue-specific expression of the MOPC 141 immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene was studied by using in vitro transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">B-cell-specific transcription of this gene was dependent on the octamer element 5'-ATGCAAAG-3 ' , located in the upstream region of this promoter and in the promoters of all other immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The interaction of purified octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 ( OTF1 and OTF2 ) with the MOPC 141 promoter was studied by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Purified OTF1 from HeLa cells and OTF1 and OTF2 from B cells bound to identical sequences within the heavy-chain promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The OTF interactions we observed extended over the heptamer element 5'-CTCAGGA-3 ' , and it <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> that the binding of the purified factors involves cooperation between octamer and heptamer sites in this promoter</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition to these elements , we identified a second regulatory element , the N element with the sequence 5'-GGAACCTCCCCC-3 ' .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The N element could independently mediate low levels of transcription in both B-cell and HeLa-cell extracts , and , in conjunction with the octamer element , it can promote high levels of transcription in B-cell extracts .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The N element bound a transcription factor , NTF , that is ubiquitous in cell-type distribution , and NTF was distinct from any of the previously described proteins that bind to similar sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Based on these results , we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> that NTF and OTF2 interactions ( both with their cognate DNA elements and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibly</cue> at the protein-protein level</scope> ) <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be critical to B-cell-specific expression</scope> and that these interactions provide additional pathways for regulating gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
