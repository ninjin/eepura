<sentence id="0">Transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc expression by protein synthesis-dependent and -independent pathways in a human T lymphoblastic tumor cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We show that in the human T lymphoblastic tumor cell line Molt4 c-myc mRNA and protein expression is down-regulated after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide , to phorbol myristate acetate , or to the calcium ionophore A23187 , which raises the intracellular calcium concentration .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A block to RNA elongation is largely responsible for decreased c-myc transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although negative regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide takes place even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide , the phorbol myristate acetate effect is blocked to some extent only by cycloheximide .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The calcium ionophore-induced c-myc suppression , however , strictly requires de novo protein synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , two different negative regulatory pathways are involved in c-myc regulation : one which is independent and one which depends on de novo protein synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The latter one <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be mediated by a rapidly calcium-dependent induced gene product</scope> .</sentence>
