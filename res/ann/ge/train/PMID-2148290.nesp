<sentence id="0">Lymphoid specific gene expression of the adenovirus early region 3 promoter is mediated by NF-kappa B binding motifs .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A primary site of infection by human adenoviruses is lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , analysis of the viral control elements and <scope type="neg" id="0">the cellular factors that regulate adenoviral gene expression in lymphocytes has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been reported</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The adenovirus early region 3 ( ES ) gene products are involved in the maintenance of viral persistence by complexing with the class I MHC antigens , thus preventing their cell surface expression with a resultant decrease in host immunologic destruction .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> different cellular factors were involved in E3 regulation in lymphocytes as compared with HeLa cells</scope> , both DNA binding and transfection analysis with the E3 promoter in both cell types were performed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These studies detected two novel domains referred to as L1 and L2 with a variety of lymphoid but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> HeLa extracts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Each of these domains possessed strong homology to motifs previously found to bind the cellular factor NF-kappa B. Transfections of E3 constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene revealed that mutagenesis of the distal NF-kappa B motif ( L2 ) had minimal effects on promoter expression in HeLa cells , but resulted in dramatic decreases in expression by lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , mutagenesis of proximal NF-kappa B motif ( L1 ) had minimal effects on gene expression in both HeLa cells and lymphoid cells but resulted in a small , but reproducible , increase in gene expression in lymphoid cells when coupled to the L2 mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Reversing the position and subsequent mutagenesis of the L1 and L2 domains <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicated that</cue> the primary sequence of these motifs <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">rather than</cue> their position in the E3 promoter</scope> was critical for regulating gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
