<sentence id="0">Control of NF-kappa B activity by the I kappa B beta inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcription factor NF-kappa B is maintained in an inactive cytoplasmic state by I kappa B inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In mammalian cells , I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta proteins have been purified and shown to be the inhibitors of NF-kappa B through their association with the p65 or c-Rel subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , we have isolated a third NF-kappa B inhibitor , I kappa B epsilon ( 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Upon treatment with a large variety of inducers , I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta are proteolytically degraded , resulting in NF-kappa B translocation into the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we show that in E29.1 T cell hybridoma I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are equally associated with p65 and that I kappa B beta is degraded in response to TNF alpha in contrast to what has been originally published .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our data also <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that , unlike I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta is constitutively phosphorylated and resynthesized as a hypophosphorylated form</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of slow migrating forms of I kappa B beta following stimulation</scope> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that the phosphorylation does not necessarily constitute the signal-induced event which targets the molecule for proteolysis</scope> .</sentence>
