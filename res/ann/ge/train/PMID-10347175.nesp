<sentence id="0">SLP-76 and Vav function in separate , but overlapping pathways to augment interleukin-2 promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">SLP-76 and Vav , two hematopoietic cell specific molecules , are critical for T cell development and activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Following T cell antigen receptor stimulation , SLP-76 and Vav both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and associate with each other via the SH2 domain of Vav and phosphorylated tyrosines of SLP-76 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Furthermore , SLP-76 and Vav have a synergistic effect on interleukin (IL)-2 promoter activity in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this report , we show that two tyrosines , Tyr-113 and Tyr-128 , of SLP-76 are required for its binding to Vav , both in vitro and in intact cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Surprisingly , we find also that <scope type="neg" id="0">the interaction between SLP-76 and Vav is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for their cooperation in augmenting IL-2 promoter activity</scope> , as <scope type="spec" id="1"> the two molecules <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to function in different signaling pathways upstream of IL-2 gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Overexpression of SLP-76 in the Jurkat T cell line potentiates the activities of both nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , overexpression of Vav leads to enhanced nuclear factor of activated T cells activity <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> affecting AP-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Additionally , overexpression of Vav , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> SLP-76</scope> , augments CD28-induced IL-2 promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the synergy between SLP-76 and Vav in regulating IL-2 gene expression reflects the cooperation between different signaling pathways</scope> .</sentence>
