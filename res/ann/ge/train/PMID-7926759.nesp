<sentence id="0">An active v-abl protein tyrosine kinase blocks immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangement .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lymphoid cells transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus have provided one of the classic models for study of early B-cell development and immunoglobulin rearrangement .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy-chain locus but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> their light chain genes</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that an active v-abl protein interferes with this differentiation step</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To test this hypothesis , light-chain gene structure was examined in pre-B cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of the Abelson virus and in derivatives that survive at the nonpermissive temperature because they express a human BCL-2 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our studies reveal that inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase triggers high-frequency rearrangement of kappa and lambda light-chain genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These events are accompanied by marked increases in the expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These increases occur in the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of protein synthesis</scope> but are dependent on inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As documented in the accompanying paper ( Klug et al. , this issue ) , an active v-abl protein also suppresses the activity of NF-kappa B/rel and expression controlled by the kappa intron enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together these data demonstrate that the v-abl protein specifically interferes with light-chain gene rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of B-cell differentiation and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating RAG gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
