<sentence id="0">Transcription factor activation in lymphokine activated killer cells and lymphocytes from patients receiving IL-2 immunotherapy .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Administration of the cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) can result in therapeutic benefits for individuals with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we report an analysis of the transcription factor families AP-1 , Sp1 , NF-kappaB , and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) in cancer patients ' lymphocytes before and after IL-2 immunotherapy , as assessed by a gel-shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An in vitro surrogate of IL-2 immunotherapy is the incubation of fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from healthy individuals in IL-2 for several days , resulting in the production of lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) activity in these cultures .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One purpose of this study was to describe the profile of transcription factor activation in these different populations , and assess <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the patterns observed correlated with functional differences in these cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Prior to in vivo IL-2 administration , the typical binding pattern of transcription factors in PBMC from patients resembled that seen in fresh PBMC from healthy individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Over a 3-week course of IL-2 therapy , in most patients the binding patterns of AP-1 , Sp1 , and NF-kappaB proteins changed to resemble those seen in PBMC activated by IL-2 in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , the cells obtained from IL-2-treated patients did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> have low-level constitutive expression of STAT binding factors</scope> as did LAK cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">When these patient cells were further stimulated by IL-2 in vitro , additional differences in STAT induction patterns were noted .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data provide further information on the molecular events occurring in immune cells generated through in vivo and in vitro administration of IL-2 , and further document that there is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> a precise congruence between PBMC activated in vivo and in vitro by IL-2</scope> .</sentence>
