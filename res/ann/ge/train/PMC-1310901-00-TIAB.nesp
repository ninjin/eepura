<sentence id="0">Down-regulation of interferon regulatory factor 4 gene expression in leukemic cells due to hypermethylation of CpG motifs in the promoter region</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although the bcr-abl translocation has been shown to be the causative genetic aberration in chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , there is mounting evidence that the deregulation of other genes , such as the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 ( IRF-4 ) , is also implicated in the pathogenesis of CML .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Promoter methylation of CpG target sites or direct deletions/insertions of genes are mechanisms of a reversible or permanent silencing of gene expression , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Therefore , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> IRF-4 promoter methylation or mutation <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be involved in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Whereas promoter mutations or structural rearrangements could be excluded as a cause of altered IRF-4 expression in hematopoietic cells , the IRF-4 promoter methylation status was found to significantly influence IRF-4 transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">First , treatment of IRF-4-negative lymphoid , myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation-inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase of IRF-4 mRNA and protein levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Second , using a restriction-PCR-assay and bisulfite-sequencing we identified specifically methylated CpG sites in IRF-4-negative but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in IRF-4-positive cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Third , we clearly determined promoter methylation as a mechanism for IRF-4 down-regulation via reporter gene assays , but did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> detect an association of methylational status and mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases or methyl-CpG-binding proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , these data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> CpG site-specific IRF-4 promoter methylation as a <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">putative</cue> mechanism of down-regulated IRF-4 expression in leukemia</scope></scope> .</sentence>
