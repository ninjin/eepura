<sentence id="0">Regulation of CD14 expression during monocytic differentiation induced with 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD14 , a monocyte/macrophage receptor for the complex of LPS and LPS binding protein , is a differentiation marker for the monocyte/macrophage lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have analyzed the regulation of CD14 expression during 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VitD3)-induced monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using FACS , Northern blotting , and nuclear run-on analyses , we demonstrate that the up-regulation of CD14 expression during monocytic cell maturation is regulated mainly at the level of gene transcription , and that new protein synthesis is required for CD14 induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have recently cloned the CD14 5' upstream sequence and demonstrated its tissue-specific promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using stable transfection of the monocytoid U937 cell line with a series of deletion mutants of the CD14 5' upstream sequence coupled to a reporter gene construct , we show that bp -128 to -70 is the critical region for the induction of CD14 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This region contains two binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A 3-bp mutation at the distal Sp1-binding site not only eliminates Sp1 interaction , but also abolishes most of the VitD3 induction of CD14 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detect a direct interaction of the CD14 distal Sp1-binding site with the vitamin D3 receptor and its partner , the retinoid X receptor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data demonstrate that VitD3 induces CD14 indirectly through some intermediary factor , and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> a critical role for Sp1 in this process</scope> .</sentence>
