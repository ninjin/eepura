<sentence id="0">IL-2-independent activation and proliferation in human T cells induced by CD28 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although the role of CD28 in T cell costimulation is firmly established , the mechanisms by which it exerts its costimulatory actions are less clear .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In many circumstances it is difficult to distinguish the effects of CD28 from subsequent actions of cytokines , such as IL-2 , on T cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report a model of CD28 costimulation using PMA plus the natural ligand CD80 that resulted in very limited stimulation of IL-2 , as evidenced by both cytokine production and IL-2 promoter stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Promoter assays revealed CD28-dependent effects on both NF-kappaB and AP-1 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> on NF-AT or the intact IL-2 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , T cell proliferation was completely resistant to the actions of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover T cell proliferation was unaffected by the addition of blocking Abs to both IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor , demonstrating that this form of costimulation by CD28 was independent of IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also investigated the effects of stimulating T cell blasts with CD80 alone and found that there was a limited requirement for IL-2 in this system .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that CD28 costimulation can cause substantial T cell proliferation in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of IL-2</scope> , which is driven by a soluble factor independent of NF-AT transactivation .</sentence>
