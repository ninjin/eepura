<sentence id="0">Induction of nuclear factor kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes by anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Monoclonal antibodies against either monomorphic or polymorphic determinants of class I antigen induced in PBMC and highly purified T lymphocytes the nuclear activity of NF-kappa B/Rel complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These included both p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers , recognized by specific antibodies in EMSA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The induced complexes were detectable in extracts of cells incubated with anti-class I monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) for 1.5 h ; the induction was maximal at 5 h , persistent at 16 h and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no longer</cue> observed at 40 h. The mAb failed to induce NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in cells incubated in the presence of 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin , an inhibitor of I kappa B-alpha degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Together , these results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that class I triggering can induce the activity of NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in peripheral blood T lymphocytes , thereby modulating the expression of genes regulated by these transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
