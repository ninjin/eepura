<sentence id="0">Modulation of the expression of the IFN-gamma receptor beta-chain controls responsiveness to IFN-gamma in human peripheral blood T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IFN-gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN- gamma <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> alter immune responsiveness to Ag. In this work</scope></scope> , we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL-2 are unresponsive to IFN-gamma , as determined by a <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of activation of jak kinases</scope> and the transcription factor , STAT1(alpha) , a signal transducer and activator of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lack</cue> of expression of the beta- chain ( accessory factor ) of the IFN-gamma receptor</scope> , while at the same time maintaining IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Expression of the beta-chain can be restored by secondary TCR ligation or PMA treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">T cell blasts treated with PMA are now responsive to IFN-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">When freshly isolated , highly enriched ( > 98 % ) T cells are examined for IFN-gamma responsiveness ; these cells can respond to IFN-gamma and express beta-chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore , as T cells progress from primary TCR activation through IL-2-dependent proliferation , followed by secondary TCR stimulation , their responsiveness to IFN-gamma varies , and this <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response</scope> .</sentence>
