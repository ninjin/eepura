<sentence id="0">Transactivation by CIITA , the type II bare lymphocyte syndrome-associated factor , requires participation of multiple regions of the TATA box binding protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CIITA is a positive regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex gene transcription that has been found to be defective in one of the five complementation groups of class II major histocompatibility complex-negative cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Its N-terminal region is capable of activating transcription from a reporter gene when fused to a DNA binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have investigated the mechanism of transactivation mediated by the CIITA activation domain by studying its role in the process of transcription initiation and elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Specifically the altered specificity TBP ( TATA box binding protein ) assay has been used to analyze the response of the CIITA activation domain to mutations in TBP known to disrupt its interaction with its associated general factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transactivation by CIITA was extremely sensitive to a mutation in TBP that in yeast is known to abolish VP16-mediated transcription but leaves basal transcription unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A TBP mutant defective in interaction with TBP-associated factor TAFII250 also <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to mediate transactivation through the CIITA activation domain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Certain interactions between TBP and general factors that are specifically required for acidic activation domains were also required for CIITA-mediated transactivation to reach its full potential .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , like VP16 , CIITA was able to stimulate elongation of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Overall the mechanism of transactivation by the human B-cell-specific CIITA is very similar to that mediated by the herpes virus transactivator VP16 in the ways that have been tested .</sentence>
