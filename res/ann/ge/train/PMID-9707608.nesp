<sentence id="0">Epstein-Barr virus-transforming protein latent infection membrane protein 1 activates transcription factor NF-kappaB through a pathway that includes the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase and the IkappaB kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent infection membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) is a constitutively aggregated pseudo-tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) that activates transcription factor NF-kappaB through two sites in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One site is similar to activated TNFRII in associating with TNFR-associated factors TRAF1 and TRAF2 , and the second site is similar to TNFRI in associating with the TNFRI death domain interacting protein TRADD .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TNFRI has been recently shown to activate NF-kappaB through association with TRADD , RIP , and TRAF2 ; activation of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ( NIK ) ; activation of the IkappaB alpha kinases ( IKKalpha and IKKbeta ) ; and phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IkappaB alpha phosphorylation on Ser-32 and Ser-36 is followed by its degradation and NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this report , we show that NF-kappaB activation by LMP1 or by each of its effector sites is mediated by a pathway that includes NIK , IKKalpha , and IKKbeta .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Dominant negative mutants of NIK , IKKalpha , or IKKbeta substantially inhibited NF-kappaB activation by LMP1 or by each of its effector sites .</sentence>
