<sentence id="0">An IRF-1-dependent pathway of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in mitogen-activated T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to DNA damage-induced apoptosis , a response which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> serve as a form of ' altruistic suicide '</scope> to counter their intrinsic high potential for mutation and clonal expansion .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to regulate this type of apoptosis in thymocytes , but <scope type="spec" id="1"> an as yet unknown , p53-independent pathway(s) <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to mediate the same event in mitogen-activated mature T lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show DNA damage-induced apoptosis in these T lymphocytes is dependent on the antioncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus two different anti-onco-genic transcription factors , p53 and IRF-1 , are required for distinct apoptotic pathways in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also show that mitogen induction of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme ( ICE ) gene , a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3 , is IRF-1-dependent .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Ectopic overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the endogenous gene for ICE and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis .</sentence>
