<sentence id="0">Induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression in monocytic cells by Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Because candidiasis and cryptococcosis are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons , the effect of Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans on HIV expression in monocytic cells was examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Stimulation of the latently HIV-infected myelomonocytic cell line OM-10.1 with C. neoformans and C. albicans in the presence of pooled human serum caused a ratio-dependent increase in HIV production .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Induction of HIV by C. neoformans was enhanced by anti-capsular antibody , while induction by both organisms was inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In THP-1 cells transfected with HIV plasmid constructs , both organisms induced transcription from the HIV long terminal repeat that was dependent on intact NF-kappaB binding sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , C. neoformans and C. albicans enhance HIV expression in monocytic cells through a TNF-alpha- and NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In HIV-infected patients , such enhancement <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> further impair host immunity</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> accelerate the course of HIV disease</scope> .</sentence>
