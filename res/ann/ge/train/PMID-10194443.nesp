<sentence id="0">Regulation of the megakaryocytic glycoprotein IX promoter by the oncogenic Ets transcription factor Fli-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glycoprotein ( GP ) IX is a subunit of the von Willebrand receptor , GPIb-V-IX , which mediates adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium of damaged blood vessels .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous characterization of the GPIX promoter identified a functional Ets site that , when disrupted , reduced promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the Ets protein(s) that regulated GPIX promoter expression was unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , transient cotransfection of several GPIX promoter/reporter constructs into 293T kidney fibroblasts with a Fli-1 expression vector shows that the oncogenic protein Fli-1 can transactivate the GPIX promoter when an intact GPIX Ets site is present .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , Fli-1 binding of the GPIX Ets site was identified in antibody supershift experiments in nuclear extracts derived from hematopoietic human erythroleukemia cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Comparative studies showed that Fli-1 was also able to transactivate the GPIbalpha and , to a lesser extent , the GPIIb promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Immunoblot analysis identified Fli-1 protein in lysates derived from platelets .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , expression of Fli-1 was identified immunohistochemically in megakaryocytes derived from CD34(+) cells treated with the megakaryocyte differentiation and proliferation factor , thrombopoietin .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="1"> Fli-1 is <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to regulate lineage-specific genes during megakaryocytopoiesis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
