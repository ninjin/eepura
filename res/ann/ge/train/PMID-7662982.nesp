<sentence id="0">TCL1 oncogene activation in preleukemic T cells from a case of ataxia-telangiectasia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The TCL1 oncogene on human chromosome 14q32.1 is involved in chromosome translocations [ t(14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q32.1 ) and t(7 ; 14 ) ( q35 ; q32.1 ) ] and inversions [ inv14(q11 ; q32.1 ) ] with TCR alpha/beta loci in T-cell leukemias , such as T-prolymphocytic ( T-PLL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is also involved in T- acute and- chronic leukemias arising in cases of ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) , an immunodeficiency syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Similar chromosomal rearrangements occur also in the clonally expanded T cells in AT patients before the appearance of the overt leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have analyzed the expression of TCL1 mRNA and protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) from four AT cases and from healthy controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that the TCL1 gene was overexpressed in the PBLs of an AT patient with a large clonal T-cell population exhibiting the t(14 ; 14 ) translocation but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in the lymphocytes of the other cases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Fluorescence in situ hybridization of the TCL1 genomic locus to lymphocyte metaphases from the AT patient with the T-cell clonal expansion showed that the breakpoint of the t(14 ; 14 ) translocation lies within the TCL1 locus and is accompanied by an inverted duplication of the distal part of chromosome 14 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> TCL1 is activated in preleukemic clonal cells as a consequence of chromosome translocation involving sequences from the TCR locus at 14q11</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Deregulation of TCL1 is the first event in the initiation of malignancy in these types of leukemias and represents a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potential</cue> tool for clinical evaluation</scope> .</sentence>
