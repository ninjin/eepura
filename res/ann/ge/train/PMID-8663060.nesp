<sentence id="0">Tissue-specific activity of the gammac chain gene promoter depends upon an Ets binding site and is regulated by GA-binding protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The gammac chain is a subunit of multiple cytokine receptors ( interleukin (IL)-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 ) , the expression of which is restricted to hematopoietic lineages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A defect in gammac leads to the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by a block in T cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to better characterize the human gammac promoter and define the minimal tissue-specific promoter region , progressive 5'-deletion constructs of a segment extending 1053 base pairs upstream of the major transcription start site were generated and tested for promoter activity in various hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The -1053/+34 construct allowed promoter activity only in cells of hematopoietic origin , and tissue specificity was conserved in all other constructs tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The region downstream of -90 appeared critical for basal promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It contains two <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> Ets binding sites conserved in the murine gammac promoter gene</scope> , one of which was found essential for functional promoter activity as determined by mutational analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The functional Ets binding site was found to bind Ets family proteins , principally GA-binding protein and Elf-1 and could be transactivated by GABPalpha and -beta synergistically .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> , as already reported for the IL2Rbeta promoter , GA-binding protein is an essential component of gammac basal promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Although GABP expression is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> restricted to the hematopoietic lineage</scope> , its interaction with other specific factors <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the gammac gene</scope> .</sentence>
