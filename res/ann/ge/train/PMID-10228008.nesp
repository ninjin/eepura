<sentence id="0">The evolutionarily conserved sequence upstream of the human Ig heavy chain S gamma 3 region is an inducible promoter : synergistic activation by CD40 ligand and IL-4 via cooperative NF-kappa B and STAT-6 binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Germline C gamma gene transcription is a crucial event in the process that leads to switch DNA recombination to IgG , but its regulation in the human is poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We took advantage of our monoclonal model of germinal center B cell differentiation , IgM+ IgD+ CL-01 cells , to define the role of the I gamma 3 evolutionarily conserved sequence ( ECS ) in the germline transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The I gamma 3 ECS lies upstream of the major I gamma 3 transcription initiation site and displays more than 90 % identity with the corresponding human I gamma 1 , I gamma 2 , and I gamma 4 regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Reporter luciferase gene vectors containing the human gamma 3 ECS were used to transfect CL-01 cells , which have been shown to undergo Smu-->S gamma 3 DNA recombination , upon engagement of CD40 by CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) and exposure to IL-4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In these transfected CL-01 cells , CD40:CD40L engagement and exposure to IL-4 synergistically induced gamma 3 ECS-dependent luciferase reporter gene activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Targeted mutational analysis demonstrated that a tandem NF-kappa B/Rel binding motif is critical for the gamma 3 ECS responsiveness to both CD40L and IL-4 , while a STAT-6-binding site is additionally required for IL-4 inducibility .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that p50/p65/c-Rel and STAT-6 are effectively induced by CD40L and IL-4 , respectively , and bind to specific DNA motifs within the ECS .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These partially overlapping CD40L and IL-4 responsive elements are functionally cooperative as the disruption of one of them prevents synergistic promoter activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , the gamma 3 ECS is an inducible promoter containing cis elements that critically mediate CD40L and IL-4-triggered transcriptional activation of the human C gamma 3 gene .</sentence>
