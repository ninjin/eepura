<sentence id="0">Distinct DNase-I hypersensitive sites are associated with TAL-1 transcription in erythroid and T-cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The tal-1 gene , frequently activated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , is expressed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages during normal hematopoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression , we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> tal-1 rearrangements</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of apparent genomic alteration of the locus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Methylation studies <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> the tal-15 ' GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island , hypomethylated in normal cells , and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Five major DNase-I hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped in the tal-1 locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">HS I , IV , and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absent</cue> in Hela</scope> , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="5"> this region <cue type="spec" id="5">might</cue> be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat , and greatly enhanced in DU528 , a T-cell line that bears a t ( 1 ; 14 ) and initiates tal-1 transcription within exon 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that distinct regulatory elements are associated with the use of the different tal-1 promoters</scope> .</sentence>
