<sentence id="0">Mycobacterium tuberculosis mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan can induce NF-kappaB-dependent activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic , extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The major goal of this study was to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV-1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These experiments are of prime importance considering that CD4-expressing T lymphocytes represent the major virus reservoir in the peripheral blood of infected individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1 LTR-dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The implication of protein tyrosine kinase(s) , protein kinase A and/or protein kinase C was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression using herbimycin A and H7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It was also determined , using electrophoresis mobility shift assays , that M. tuberculosis ManLAM led to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">M. tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the luciferase gene placed under the control of the wild-type , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> the kappaB-mutated , HIV-1 LTR region</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription was found to be independent of the autocrine or paracrine action of endogenous TNF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that M. tuberculosis can upregulate HIV-1 expression in T cells and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">could</cue> thus have the potential to influence the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection</scope></scope> .</sentence>
