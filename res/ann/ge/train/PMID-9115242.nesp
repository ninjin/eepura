<sentence id="0">Transcriptional induction of collagenase-1 in differentiated monocyte-like ( U937 ) cells is regulated by AP-1 and an upstream C/EBP-beta site .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this report , we demonstrate that the AP-1 site and a distal promoter element regulate transcriptional induction of collagenase-1 during monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression constructs containing regions of the human collagenase-1 promoter were stably or transiently transfected into U937 cells , and reporter activity was assessed at various times after the onset of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-mediated differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Rapid and strong induction of promoter activity was lost in constructs with a mutant AP-1 element ; however , at 16-96 h post-PMA , the mutant collagenase-1 promoter displayed AP-1 independent PMA-mediated transactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The AP-1 mutant constructs also showed delayed transcriptional activation in PMA-treated fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Western and supershift analyses <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> functional Jun and Fos proteins were present in nuclear extracts of PMA-differentiated U937 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Promoter deletion constructs demonstrated the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> role of distal promoter sequences in regulating collagenase-1 transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In particular , Western , supershift , and promoter deletion analyses <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> a role for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta ( C/EBP-beta ) binding site between -2010 and -1954 in regulating transcription of collagenase-1 in monocytic cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that distinct regulatory elements , acting somewhat independently of each other , control expression of collagenase-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , our data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> that the rapid PMA-mediated induction of collagenase-1 transcription is controlled by a mechanism distinct from that regulating the sustained expression of this proteinase in activated macrophages</scope> .</sentence>
