<sentence id="0">Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by combination of a novel inhibitor of TNF-alpha with AZT .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The small molecule S9a was derived from an established tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) inhibitor ( Canventol ) by replacement of the isopropylidine group with a phenyl ring .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">S9a at 10 to 100 nM inhibited HIV production as potently as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine ( AZT ) , an inhibitor of viral reverse transcriptase .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Furthermore , S9a and AZT in combination , at noncytoxic concentrations strongly inhibited HIV-1 replication that was more than additive and substantially prolonged the appearance of virus both in acutely infected CD4+ lymphocytes ( SupT ) in culture and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) infected with a primary HIV-1 isolate .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">S9a inhibited TNF-alpha promoter-driven reporter gene activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It was <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">proposed</cue> that the mechanism of antiviral action of S9a was on the host cell , by blocking TNF-alpha transcription via a Tat-induced tar-independent loop , which decreases downstream NF-kappaB activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">S9a was superior to the first generation compound Canventol , which was superior to the natural compound sarcophytol A , demonstrating that further structure-based enhancement of potency of these compounds is feasible .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This study <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> a therapeutic approach against AIDS by application of two drugs , one against a cellular and the other a viral target</scope> , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> provide an approach to the problem of frequent emergence of resistant variants to combinations of drugs that target only HIV genes</scope> .</sentence>
