<sentence id="0">Inducible binding to the c-fos serum response element during T cell activation is regulated by a phosphotyrosine-containing protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The proto-oncogene c-fos is an immediate-early gene , and one of the first genes transcribed after stimulation of most cells with a variety of ligands .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Fos expression <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be a pivotal event in converting ligand-receptor interactions at the membrane into functional modulation of cell phenotype</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The serum response element ( SRE ) in the c-fos regulatory region participates in induction of transcription by various growth factors and by phorbol esters and subsequent squelching of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that an inducible protein complex ( Band A ) binds to SRE DNA within 10 min after mitogenic stimulation of human PBL-T , and becomes nondetectable by 60 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Band A contains the serum response factor plus additional factor(s) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A protein that is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue in resting PBL-T suppresses binding of a component of Band A to the SRE motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Upon stimulation of the cells , this protein <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no longer</cue> prevents binding of DNA by Band A</scope> , and suppression of binding is restored within 30 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The phosphorylated tyrosine residue itself is important for the protein-protein interaction .</sentence>
