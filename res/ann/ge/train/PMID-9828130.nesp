<sentence id="0">Cloning of ARE-containing genes by AU-motif-directed display .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A procedure suitable for cloning labile mRNAs that contain AU motifs is presented ( AU-DD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These motifs are regulatory sequences within the so-called AU-rich elements ( AREs ) often found in 3' untranslated regions of genes such as cytokines , proto-oncogenes , and transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">AU-DD is an AU-motif-directed differential display that permits the identification of ARE-containing genes differentially expressed after cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It has been applied to peripheral blood monocytes and a T cell clone to isolate 59 cDNA fragments associated to activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Fourteen percent of isolated fragments belong to already known genes that certainly are cytokines and transduction/transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The remaining 86 % correspond to unknown genes of which 92 % have been confirmed to be differentially expressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data demonstrate the efficiency of the system and support the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">notion</cue> that numerous genes falling into those categories remain unidentified and that they can be cloned by this method</scope> .</sentence>
