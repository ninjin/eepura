<sentence id="0">Lymphocytes from CML patients <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> a 47 kDa factor having affinity for a genomic sterol regulatory sequence</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Deranged cellular cholesterol homeostasis has been widely recognized in the initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Since the human genomic sterol regulatory element ( SRE ) has been shown to regulate various key genes involved in this phenomenon , the present study revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects , as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , this factor appeared when these CML patients achieved complete haematological remission ( CHR ) through alpha-interferon therapy .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , an inverse relationship was also observed between the LDL receptor gene expression at the transcriptional level and the binding affinity of this 47 kDa protein factor to the SRE sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Based upon these results we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that this factor <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> have a role in pathophysiology of chronic myeloid leukaemia</scope></scope> .</sentence>
