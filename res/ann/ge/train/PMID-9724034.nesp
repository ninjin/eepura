<sentence id="0">Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and regulation of NF-kappaB activity in human leukemic T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was investigated in glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 and resistant ICR27TK.3 human leukemic T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Following glucocorticoid treatment of 6TG1.1 cells , chromatin fragmentation was observed after a delay of 24 h. Fragmentation was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> observed in ICR27TK.3 cells containing mutant glucocorticoid receptors ( L753F ) that are activation-deficient but retain the ability to repress AP-1 activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">Nor</cue> was fragmentation observed after treatment with RU38486</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> <scope type="neg" id="2">repression of AP-1 activity is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> involved</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As described in other systems , fragmentation required ongoing protein synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide anytime during the first 18 h of steroid treatment was as effective in blocking chromatin fragmentation as inhibition for the entire period , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that synthesis of a component with a rapid turnover rate is required</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Dexamethasone treatment completely blocked 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate induction of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) activity and elicited an increase in the amount of immunoreactive IkappaB alpha in sensitive 6TG1.1 cells but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> in resistant ICR27TK.3 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , mild detergent treatment of cell extracts <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicated that</cue> a substantial amount of cytoplasmic NF-kappaB is complexed with <scope type="spec" id="7"> IkappaB alpha <cue type="spec" id="7">or</cue> some other inhibitory factor</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggest</cue> that induction of a labile inhibitory factor such as IkappaB alpha <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> contribute to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
