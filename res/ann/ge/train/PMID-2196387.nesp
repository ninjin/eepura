<sentence id="0">Inducible nuclear factor binding to the kappa B elements of the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer in T cells can be blocked by cyclosporin A in a signal-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to exert its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the expression of a distinct set of lymphokine genes which are induced upon T-cell activation , among them the gene coding for interleukin-2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , the activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is partially suppressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying suppression by CsA , we have investigated the effects of this drug on transcription factors in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we report that the formation of two distinct mitogen-inducible DNA-binding complexes , the kappa B complex within the HIV enhancer and the NFAT-1 complex within the interleukin-2 enhancer , is inhibited in the presence of CsA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The kappa B-binding activity with the HIV enhancer is inhibited only if it is activated via the mitogen phytohemagglutinin whereas phorbol myristate acetate-mediated activation is completely insensitive to the drug .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> a model in which functionally indistinguishable kappa B complexes can be activated via two separate pathways of signal transduction distinguishable by CsA</scope> .</sentence>
