<sentence id="0">The regulation of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter region in macrophage , T cell , and B cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The 1311-base pair human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha promoter region was fused to the luciferase ( Luc ) reporter gene and studied in a transient transfection system in three TNF producing cell lines , the U937 macrophage cell line , the MLA 144 T cell line , and the 729-6 B cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This full length promoter construct can be induced by phorbol 13-myristate acetate ( PMA ) in each of these cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis of a series of 5'-truncations showed several peaks of basal and PMA induced activity <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> the presence of several positive and negative regulatory elements</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -95 and -36 bp relative to the transcription start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Within this region , single AP-2- and AP-1- like consensus sequences were noted .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These AP-2 and AP-1 sites were each modified with a double point mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A modest ( 20-50 % ) reduction in TNF promoter activity was observed with the AP-2 site mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , mutation of the AP-1 site markedly diminished both the basal and PMA-activated promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Also co-transfections of the wild-type promoter construct with an AP-1/c-jun expression vector resulted in augmented basal and PMA-induced promoter activity .</sentence>
