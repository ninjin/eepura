<sentence id="1">Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1 ) is a 130-kD member of the Ig gene superfamily that is expressed on platelets , endothelial cells , and certain leukocyte subsets .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To examine the factors controlling vascular-specific expression of PECAM-1 , we cloned the 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene and analyzed its transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( 5'-RACE ) analysis showed that transcription initiation occurred at several closely spaced nearby sites originating approximately 204 bp upstream from the translation start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis of the sequence immediately upstream from the transcription initiation site ( TIS ) showed <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> canonical TATA or CAAT elements</scope> , however an initiator element commonly found in TATA-less promoters encompassed the TIS .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">5'-serially truncated PECAM-1 promoter segments cloned in front of a luciferase reporter drove transcription in both a lineage- and orientation-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Putative cis-acting control elements present within a 300-bp core promoter included two ets sites , an Sp1 site , tandem E-box domains , two GATA-associated sites ( CACCC ) , an AP-2 binding site , and a GATA element at -24 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Mutational analysis showed that optimal transcriptional activity required the GATA sequence at position -24 , and gel-shift assays further showed that the GATA-2 transcription factor , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> GATA-1</scope> , bound to this region of the PECAM-1 promoter .</sentence>
