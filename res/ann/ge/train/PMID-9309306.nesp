<sentence id="0">Alcohol-induced regulation of nuclear regulatory factor-kappa beta in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Acute ethanol exposure has the capacity to modulate immune functions , particularly , to down regulate monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the intracellular mechanisms for these effects of ethanol are <cue type="spec" id="0">yet to</cue> be understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Considering that nuclear regulatory factor-kappa beta ( NF-kappa B ) / Rel is a common regulatory element of the promoter region of the inflammatory cytokine genes , herein , we tested the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that acute ethanol affects NF-kappa B activation in human monocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Adherence-isolated monocytes showed constitutive DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B. A clinically relevant dose ( 25 mM ) of acute ethanol treatment in vitro increased NF-kappa B binding activity in monocytes with a preferential induction of the inhibitory , p50/p50 , NF-kappa B/Rel homodimer , and resulted in <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> induction of the p65/p50 heterodimer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , lipopolysaccharide stimulation primarily induced the p65/p50 heterodimer that has been shown to result in gene activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , such unique activation of the inhibitory p50/p50 homodimer by acute ethanol treatment <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> result in inhibition <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">rather than</cue> activation of NF-kappa B-regulated inflammatory cytokine genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consequently , these results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> affect production of inflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-1 beta , and interleukin-6 by disrupting NF-kappa B signaling in monocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
