<sentence id="0">Vitamin E therapy of acute CCl4-induced hepatic injury in mice is associated with inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxidative stress , with reactive oxygen intermediate formation , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> represent a common mechanism by which liver injury is induced by diverse etiologies</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Oxidative stress enhances nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activity , and NF-kappa B activity has been shown to enhance the expression of cytotoxic cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Acute hepatic injury caused by reactive oxygen intermediate production was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 in mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This injury was significantly inhibited by intravenous pretreatment of the mice with a water-soluble emulsion of alpha-tocopherol .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Alpha-tocopherol treatment of the mice given the CCl4 also reduced the NF-kappa B binding to levels approaching those found in normal mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In vitro treatment of a monocyte/macrophage cell line with CCl4 led to enhanced NF-kappa B binding and an increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) messenger RNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Liver specimens taken from patients with acute fulminant hepatitis had markedly increased NF-kappa B binding activity in comparison with the binding of normal livers .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data demonstrate that abolishing acute hepatic injury with alpha-tocopherol , a free radical scavenger , also eliminated increased NF-kappa B binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">It is tempting to <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">speculate</cue> that enhanced NF-kappa B expression caused by free radical production/oxidative stress <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> modulate liver injury , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">perhaps</cue> through an effect on cytotoxic cytokine synthesis</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
