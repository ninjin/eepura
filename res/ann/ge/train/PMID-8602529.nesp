<sentence id="0">A mammalian histone deacetylase related to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p [ see comments ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Trapoxin is a microbially derived cyclotetrapeptide that inhibits histone deacetylation in vivo and causes mammalian cells to arrest in the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing , and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit ( HD1 ) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p , these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription .</sentence>
