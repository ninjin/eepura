<sentence id="0">Oct2 transactivation from a remote enhancer position requires a B-cell-restricted activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previous cotransfection experiments had demonstrated that ectopic expression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Oct2 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> efficiently activate a promoter containing an octamer motif</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Oct2 expression was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">unable</cue> to stimulate a multimerized octamer enhancer element in HeLa cells</scope> , however .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have tested a variety of Oct2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing for the capability to activate an octamer enhancer in nonlymphoid cells and a B-cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our analyses show that several Oct2 isoforms can stimulate from a remote position but that this stimulation is restricted to B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This result <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates</cue> the involvement of <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">either</cue> a B-cell-specific cofactor or a specific modification of a cofactor or the Oct2 protein</scope> in Oct2-mediated enhancer activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutational analyses <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> the carboxy-terminal domain of Oct2 is critical for enhancer activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the Oct1 protein , which by itself was <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">unable</cue> to stimulate from a remote position</scope> .</sentence>
