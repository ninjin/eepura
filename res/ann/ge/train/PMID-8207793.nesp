<sentence id="0">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat upregulates interleukin-2 secretion in activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Dysregulation of cytokines secreted by T cells <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat on interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) expression , we used IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Transient expression of HIV-1 Tat induced a five- to eightfold increase in IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IL-2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Analysis of mRNA <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that Tat exerts its effect on IL-2 primarily at the transcriptional level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The NF-kappa B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> sufficient for the Tat effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The Tat-mediated increase in IL-2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or-unlike the analogous effect of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax-by cyclosporin A. The observed increase in IL-2 levels <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> facilitate virus spread from or to T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , it <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">might</cue> contribute to the hypergammaglobulinemia or , together with other cytokines found to be dysregulated , the T-helper cell dysfunctions observed in AIDS patients</scope> .</sentence>
