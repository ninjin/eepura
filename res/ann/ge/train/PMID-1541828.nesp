<sentence id="1">IL-4 secreted by activated T cells is a pleiotropic cytokine affecting growth and differentiation of diverse cell types such as T cells , B cells , and mast cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the upstream regulatory elements of the human IL-4 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A novel T cell-specific negative regulatory element ( NRE ) composed of two protein-binding sites were mapped in the 5' flanking region of the IL-4 gene : -311CTCCCTTCT-303 ( NRE-I ) and -288CTTTTTGCTT-TGC-300 ( NRE-II ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A T cell-specific protein Neg-1 and a ubiquitous protein Neg-2 binding to NRE-I and NRE-II , respectively , were identified .</sentence>
