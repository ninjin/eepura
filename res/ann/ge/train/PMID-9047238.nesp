<sentence id="0">c-Rel is a target of pentoxifylline-mediated inhibition of T lymphocyte activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> clinical use of the methyl xanthine derivative , pentoxifylline ( PF ) , for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases</scope> is being noted with increasing interest .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this paper , we studied the molecular consequences of PF treatment during lymphocyte activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that in T cells , anti-CD3-induced c-Rel expression was blocked by PF , whereas the induction of other NF-kappaB family members was not significantly affected .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , <scope type="neg" id="1">induction of NF-AT , which has the same signaling requirements as c-Rel induction , was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> inhibited by PF</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Among genes that respond to these transcription factors , IL-2 mRNA induction was suppressed by PF , whereas <scope type="neg" id="2">IL-2R(alpha) chain mRNA induction was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These observations implicated c-Rel as an IL-2 promoter factor , for which experimental support was obtained from transient transfection experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast with the observation in T cells , <scope type="neg" id="3">c-Rel induction was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> blocked by PF in B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The greater selectivity of PF , compared with FK506 , at both the molecular and cellular levels <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> prove advantageous in manipulating T cell responses in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
