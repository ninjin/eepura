<sentence id="1">Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) and interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) control the differentiation of T-helper cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we summarize studies which investigate the mechanism by which these cytokines selectively reprogramme gene expression in T-lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cytokine stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of the corresponding cytokine receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for latent , cytoplasmic transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Receptor/Stat interaction is mediated by the src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain of the corresponding Stat protein .</sentence>
