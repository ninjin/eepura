<sentence id="0">Rescue by cytokines of apoptotic cell death induced by IL-2 deprivation of human antigen-specific T cell clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The control of cell survival and cell death is of central importance in tissues with high cell turnover such as the lymphoid system .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have examined the effect of cytokines on IL-2 deprivation-induced apoptosis of human antigen-specific T helper clones with different cytokine production profiles .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that IL-2 , interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) , and IFN-beta inhibited IL-2 deprivation apoptosis in Th0 , Th1 , and Th2 clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also found that IL-2 protects T cell clones from IL-2 deprivation apoptosis accompanying active proliferation and enhanced expression of P53 , Rb and Bcl-xL proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , IFN-alpha/beta rescued T cell clones from apoptosis <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> active proliferation</scope> , and expression of apoptosis-associated proteins tested so far was unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be due to the fact that T cells treated with IL-2 contained those located in S + G2/M phases of the cell cycle , whereas the vast majority of T cells treated with IFN-alpha/beta were located in G0/G1 phase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">IFN-alpha/beta specifically induced tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation into nucleus of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 2 protein in the T cell clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , over-expression of STAT2 by transfection of the cDNA prevented apoptosis of the T cell clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our present study shows that IFN-alpha and -beta mediate anti-apoptotic effect through other pathways than that of IL-2 in growth factor deprivation apoptosis .</sentence>
