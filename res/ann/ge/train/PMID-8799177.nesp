<sentence id="0">Epstein-Barr viral latency is disrupted by the immediate-early BRLF1 protein through a cell-specific mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis , is a human herpesvirus associated with epithelial cell malignancies ( nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) as well as B-cell malignancies .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central issue in herpesvirus biology .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Epithelial cells are the major site of lytic EBV replication within the human host , and viral reactivation occurs in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It is known that expression of a single viral immediate-early protein , BZLF1 , is sufficient to initiate the switch from latent to lytic infection in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Cellular regulation of BZLF1 transcription is therefore <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to play a key role in regulating the stringency of viral latency</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Here we show that , unexpectedly , expression of another viral immediate-early protein , BRLF1 , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell-specific fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the mechanisms leading to disruption of EBV latency <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to be cell-type specific</scope> .</sentence>
