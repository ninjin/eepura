<sentence id="0">NF-kappaB activation is a critical regulator of human granulocyte apoptosis in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During beneficial inflammation , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> tissue-damaging</scope> granulocytes undergo apoptosis before being cleared by phagocytes in a non-phlogistic manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that the rate of constitutive apoptosis in human neutrophils and eosinophils is greatly accelerated in both a rapid and concentration-dependent manner by the fungal metabolite gliotoxin , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> by its inactive analog methylthiogliotoxin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This induction of apoptosis was abolished by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk , correlated with the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) , and was mimicked by a cell permeable inhibitory peptide of NF-kappaB , SN-50 ; other NF-kappaB inhibitors , curcumin and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ; and the proteasome inhibitor , MG-132 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Gliotoxin also augmented dramatically the early ( 2-6 h ) pro-apoptotic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) in neutrophils and unmasked the ability of TNF-alpha to induce eosinophil apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In neutrophils , TNF-alpha caused a gliotoxin-inhibitable activation of an inducible form of NF-kappaB , a response that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> underlie the ability of TNF-alpha to delay apoptosis at later times ( 12-24 h ) and limit its early killing effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , cycloheximide displayed a similar capacity to enhance TNF-alpha induced neutrophil apoptosis even at time points when cycloheximide alone had <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> pro-apoptotic effect</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that NF-kappaB <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> regulate the production of protein(s) which protect neutrophils from the cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data shed light on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulating human granulocyte apoptosis and , in particular , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicate that</cue> the transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in regulating the physiological cell death pathway in granulocytes</scope> .</sentence>
