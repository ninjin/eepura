<sentence id="0">Expression of PILOT , a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> transcription factor</scope> , requires two signals and is cyclosporin A sensitive in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Few known genes ( IL-2 , members of the IL-8 family , interferon-gamma ) are induced in T cells only through the combined effect of phorbol myristic acetate ( PMA ) and a Ca(2+)-ionophore , and expression of only these genes can be fully suppressed by Cyclosporin A ( CyA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have identified a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> transcription factor , designated PILOT , with an identical dual signal requirement for expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Induction of the PILOT gene is detectable in human T cells 20 min following activation in the presence of cycloheximide and is fully suppressed by CyA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The PILOT protein has a calculated M(r) of 42.6 kDa and contains three zinc fingers of the C2H2-type at the carboxyl-terminus which are highly homologous to the zinc finger regions of the transcription factors EGR1 , EGR2 , and pAT 133 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast to T cells , in fibroblasts PILOT gene expression requires only one signal ( PMA ) and <scope type="neg" id="2">is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected by CyA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This observation directly demonstrates the existence of a Ca2+ signal-dependent regulatory element obligatory for expression of some genes in T cells but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> in fibroblasts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This differential expression model will be valuable in the dissection of the dual signal pathway in T cells and the effects of CyA upon it .</sentence>
