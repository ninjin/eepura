<sentence id="0">Surfactant suppresses NF-kappa B activation in human monocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In addition to biophysical properties , pulmonary surfactant has immunomodulatory activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously demonstrated that both synthetic ( Exosurf ) and modified natural surfactant ( Survanta ) downregulated endotoxin-stimulated inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels and protein products ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha [ TNF ] , interleukin-1-beta [ IL-1 ] , interleukin-6 [ IL-6 ] ) in human alveolar macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we report that both Exosurf and Survanta suppress TNF mRNA and secretion ( 85 +/- 4 % mean percent inhibition +/- SEM by Exosurf ; 71 +/- 6 % by Survanta ) by endotoxin-stimulated THP-1 , a human monocytic cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Because surfactant downregulated inflammatory cytokine production similarly in both normal human alveolar macrophages and the THP-1 cell line , we used this cell line to investigate <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> surfactant affected transcriptional mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Specifically , we examined nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) activation because it is crucial in transcriptional regulation of many inflammatory cytokine genes including TNF , IL-1 , and IL-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that both surfactants decreased activation of NF-kappa B. The presence of both p65 and p50 NF-kappa B components in LPS-activated THP-1 cells was confirmed by specific antibody induction of supershifts in mobility assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results are the first to <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that surfactant 's suppressive effects on inflammatory cytokine production <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> involve transcriptional regulation through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
