<sentence id="0">Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors activates HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven transcription in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Elevation of the levels of circulating immune complexes frequently accompanies HIV-1 infection and is a prognostic indicator of clinical progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we report that cross-linking of Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII by adherent human IgG or by specific anti-Fc gamma R mAb activates HIV-1 gene expression in the human monocytic cell line BF24 and increased HIV RNA expression in monocytes from HIV infected patients as assayed by reverse transcription-PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In THP-1 cells , Fc gamma R cross-linking induced NF-kappa B , which is known to bind to the regulatory region of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of HIV-1 and to activate HIV-1 transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Anti-TNF-alpha antibody but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> anti-IL-1 beta antibody</scope> strongly inhibited both the induction of HIV-1-LTR-driven transcription and the induction of NF-kappa B by Fc gamma R cross-linking .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> Fc gamma R can mediate a TNF-alpha-dependent induction of HIV-1 gene transcription</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that immune complexes <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> contribute to the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection by augmenting viral replication in monocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
