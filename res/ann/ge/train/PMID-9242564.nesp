<sentence id="0">A shortened life span of EKLF-/- adult erythrocytes , due to a deficiency of beta-globin chains , is ameliorated by human gamma-globin chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using homologous recombination , both EKLF alleles in murine embryonic stem ( ES ) cells were inactivated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These EKLF-/- ES cells were capable of undergoing in vitro differentiation to form definitive erythroid colonies that were similar in size and number to those formed by wild-type ES cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the EKLF-/- colonies were poorly hemoglobinized and enucleated erythrocytes in these colonies contained numerous Heinz bodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analyses revealed that adult and embryonic globin genes were appropriately regulated , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">with the</cue> exception of beta h1-globin , which continued to be expressed at a very low level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The ratio of adult beta-globin/alpha-globin mRNA in the mutant ES cells was 1/15 of that in wild-type ES cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">When the EKLF-/- cells were injected into blastocysts , they did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> contribute at a detectable level to the mature erythrocyte compartment of the chimeric animals , based on analysis of glucose phosphate isomerase-1 ( GPI-1 ) isozymes and hemoglobins that distinguish ES cell-derived erythrocytes from host blastocyst-derived erythrocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from reticulocytes of the same chimeric animals <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that the ES cell-derived reticulocytes were present at a level of 6 % to 8 %</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> the EKLF-/- erythrocytes in adult animals <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">must</cue> be short-lived , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">apparently</cue> due to the imbalance of beta- versus alpha-globin chains</scope></scope> , leading to the precipitation of excess alpha-globin chains to form Heinz bodies</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Consistent with this hypothesis , the short life span was ameliorated by introduction into the EKLF-/- ES cells of a human LCR/gamma-globin gene , as evidenced by the presence of ES cell-derived reticulocytes as well as mature erythrocytes in the blood of the chimeric animals .</sentence>
