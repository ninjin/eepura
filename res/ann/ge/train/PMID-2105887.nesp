<sentence id="0">A factor known to bind to endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer only in lymphocytes is a ubiquitously active transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcriptional enhancer located in the first intron of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region is a major determinant of B-cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Like other enhancers , the Ig heavy chain enhancer contains several short sequence motifs that bind specific transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Each binding site contributes to the overall activity of the enhancer , however <scope type="spec" id="1"> <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> single element <cue type="spec" id="1">seems</cue> absolutely required for activity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For a better understanding of the Ig heavy chain enhancer components , we have cloned and analyzed individual sequence elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We find that the factor that binds to the E3 enhancer motif , CATGTGGC , is a ubiquitous transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It is present in an active form in both B cells and non-B cells , where it can mediate transcriptional activation in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <scope type="neg" id="2">the factor is <cue type="spec" id="4">apparently</cue> <cue type="neg" id="2">unable</cue> to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-lymphoid cells</scope></scope> : In previous experiments by others , the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor , designated NF-muE3 , was detected in B cells but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> in non-B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">From this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in B lymphocytes : ( a ) cell-specific factors such as Oct-2A and Oct-2B <scope type="neg" id="5">that are <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> expressed in most other cell types</scope> : ( b ) ubiquitous factors such as NF-kappa B that are constitutively active in B cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells ; ( c ) ubiquitously active factors , exemplified by the one binding to the E3 sequence motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This factor is present in an active form in a variety of cell types but <scope type="neg" id="6">is <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">apparently</cue> <cue type="neg" id="6">unable</cue> to bind to the endogenous Ig heavy chain enhancer in non-B cells</scope></scope> , <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">perhaps</cue> due to a non-permissive chromatin structure of the Ig heavy chain locus</scope> .</sentence>
