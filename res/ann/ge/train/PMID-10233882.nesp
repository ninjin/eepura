<sentence id="0">An essential role for NF-kappaB in human CD34(+) bone marrow cell survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcription factor , NF-kappaB , is important for T-cell activation , B-cell maturation , and human immunodeficiency virus transcription and plays a role in alternatively mediating and protecting against apoptosis in a variety of cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="neg" id="0">a role for NF-kappaB in human CD34(+) bone marrow cells has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been described</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We provide evidence here that virtually all human CD34(+) bone marrow cells express NF-kappaB that can be activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and a variety of cytokines , eg , tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin-3 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , we demonstrate that <scope type="spec" id="1"> NF-kappaB <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be required for human CD34(+) bone marrow cell clonogenic function and survival</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results offer insight into a new role for NF-kappaB in maintaining survival and function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="3"> proposed strategies involving inhibition of NF-kappaB activation as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy <cue type="spec" id="3">should</cue> be approached with caution</scope></scope> .</sentence>
