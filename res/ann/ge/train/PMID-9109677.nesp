<sentence id="0">Involvement of an SAF-like transcription factor in the activation of serum amyloid A gene in monocyte/macrophage cells by lipopolysaccharide .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Serum amyloid A ( SAA ) has been linked to atherosclerosis because of its ability to remodel high-density lipoprotein by the depletion of apolipoprotein A1 , its ability to bind cholesterol , and its presence in the atherosclerotic plaques of coronary and carotid arteries .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we investigated the induction mechanism of SAA gene in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells which play a critical role in the development of atherosclerotic fatty streak and plaque formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We and others have shown that SAA gene is induced in monocyte/macrophage cells by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By promoter function analysis , we show that the SAA promoter sequence between -280 and -226 can confer LPS responsiveness .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay detected an induced DNA-binding activity in these cells in response to LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Characterization of the DNA-binding protein by UV cross-linking , Southwestern blot , and antibody ablation/supershift assays revealed that it is similar to a recently reported nuclear factor designated SAF .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results demonstrated that LPS-mediated SAA gene induction in monocyte/macrophage cells is primarily due to the induction of SAF activity .</sentence>
