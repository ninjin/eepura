<sentence id="0">Nitric oxide-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on p21ras .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The protooncogene p21ras , a monomeric G protein family member , plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we report that nitric oxide ( NO ) activates p21ras in human T cells as evidenced by an increase in GTP-bound p21ras .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21ras demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21ras in association with GDP/GTP exchange .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling , such as NF-kappa B activation , and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These studies identify p21ras as a target of the same cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These studies identify p21ras as a target of NO in T cells and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that NO activates p21ras by an action which mimics that of guanine nucleotide exchange factors</scope> .</sentence>
