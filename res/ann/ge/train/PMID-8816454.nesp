<sentence id="0">Cloning and characterization of the beta subunit of human proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor and its involvement in transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor ( PTF ) , which binds the PSE of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed mammalian small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) genes , is essential for their transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously reported the purification of human PTF , a complex of four subunits , and the molecular cloning and characterization of PTF gamma and delta subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we describe the isolation and expression of a cDNA encoding PTF beta , as well as functional studies using anti-PTF beta antibodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Native PTF beta , in either protein fractions or a PTF-Oct-1-DNA complex , can be recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant PTF beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Immunodepletion studies show that PTF beta is required for transcription of both classes of snRNA genes in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that substantial and similar molar amounts of TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) and TFIIIB90 can weakly associate with PTF at low salt conditions , but this association is dramatically reduced at high salt concentrations .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Along with our previous demonstration of both physical interactions between PTF gamma/PTF delta and TBP and the involvement of TFIIIB90 in the transcription of class III snRNA genes , these results are consistent with the notion that a TBP-containing complex related to TFIIIB is required for the transcription of class III snRNA genes , and acts through weak interaction with the four-subunit PTF .</sentence>
