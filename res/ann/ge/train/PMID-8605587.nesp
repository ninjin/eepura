<sentence id="0">Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors inhibit phorbol myristate acetate and cytokine-induced HIV-1 expression chronically infected U1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) binding protein-1 ( r-h TBP-1 ) and recombinant human soluble dimeric TNF receptor ( rhu TNFR:Fc ) were used to determine the relative contributions of TNF to phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and cytokine-induced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication in chronically infected cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Treatment of HIV-1-infected promonocytic U1 cells with r-h-TBP-1 or rhu TNFR:Fc reduced PMA-induced HIV-1 p24 antigen production in a concentration-dependent manner , with a maximal inhibition of approximately 90 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Maximal inhibition of p24 antigen production in T-lymphocytic ACH-2 cells was 47 % with r-hTBP-1 and 42 % with rhu TNFR:Fc .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">r-hTBP-1 and rhu TNFR:Fc also decreased p24 antigen synthesized by U1 cells in response to other stimuli , including phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced supernatant , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , interleukin-6 , and TNF .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Addition of r-hTBP-1 to U1 cells during the last 4 h of a 24 h incubation with PMA still inhibited p24 antigen production by 15 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">U1 cells stimulated with 10(-7) M PMA released approximately 1 ng/ml endogenous TBP-1 with an initial peak observed at 1 h and a second peak at 24 h after PMA stimulation .</sentence>
