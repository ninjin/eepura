<sentence id="0">Targeted remodeling of human beta-globin promoter chromatin structure produces increased expression and decreased silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The chromatin structure of the human beta-globin gene locus assumes a transcriptionally-active conformation in erythroid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One feature of this chromatin reorganization is the formation of DNase 1 hypersensitive sites in the regions of active globin gene promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This reorganization requires the globin locus control region and is associated with normal expression of the beta-like globin genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> it is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> to artificially enhance the opening of the chromatin structure of a minimal beta-globin promoter</scope></scope> , we placed a 101bp , erythroid-specific DNase 1 hypersensitive site-forming element ( HSFE ) immediately upstream of the beta-globin promoter and gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This element includes binding sites for NF-E2 , AP-1 , GATA-1 and Sp-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Constructs were stably transfected into murine erythroleukemia cells and promoter chromatin structure and gene expression were analyzed .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The HSFE induced an area of enhanced DNase 1 hypersensitivity extending from the transcriptional start site to -300bp of the artificial promoter and significantly increased the proportion of beta-globin promoters in an open chromatin configuration .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulted in 3-fold increases in beta-globin gene transcription and induction , and inhibited long-term beta-globin gene silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> a relatively small cis-acting element is able to enhance remodeling of promoter chromatin structure resulting in increased beta-globin gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
