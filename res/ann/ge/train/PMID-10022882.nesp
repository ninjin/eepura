<sentence id="0">Reactive oxygen intermediate-dependent NF-kappaB activation by interleukin-1beta requires 5-lipoxygenase or NADPH oxidase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We previously reported that the role of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) in NF-kappaB activation by proinflammatory cytokines was cell specific .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the sources for ROIs in various cell types are yet to be determined and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> include 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) and NADPH oxidase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">5-LOX and 5-LOX activating protein ( FLAP ) are coexpressed in lymphoid cells but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in monocytic or epithelial cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Stimulation of lymphoid cells with interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) led to ROI production and NF-kappaB activation , which could both be blocked by antioxidants or FLAP inhibitors , confirming that 5-LOX was the source of ROIs and was required for NF-kappaB activation in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-1beta stimulation of epithelial cells did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> generate any ROIs and <scope type="neg" id="3">NF-kappaB induction was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> influenced by 5-LOX inhibitors</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , reintroduction of a functional 5-LOX system in these cells allowed ROI production and 5-LOX-dependent NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In monocytic cells , IL-1beta treatment led to a production of ROIs which is independent of the 5-LOX enzyme but requires the NADPH oxidase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This pathway involves the Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases , two enzymes <scope type="neg" id="4">which are <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> required for NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta in epithelial cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In conclusion , three different cell-specific pathways lead to NF-kappaB activation by IL-1beta : a pathway dependent on ROI production by 5-LOX in lymphoid cells , an ROI- and 5-LOX-independent pathway in epithelial cells , and a pathway requiring ROI production by NADPH oxidase in monocytic cells .</sentence>
