<sentence id="0">Erythropoietin-dependent induction of hemoglobin synthesis in a cytokine-dependent cell line M-TAT .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">M-TAT is a cytokine-dependent cell line with the potential to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We cultured M-TAT cells long term ( > 1 year ) in the continuous presence of erythropoietin ( EPO ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , or stem cell factor ( SCF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These long term cultures are referred to as M-TAT/EPO , M-TAT/GM-CSF , and M-TAT/SCF cells , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Hemoglobin concentration and gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA levels were significantly higher in M-TAT/EPO cells than in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When the supplemented cytokine was switched from GM-CSF to EPO , hemoglobin synthesis in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells increased rapidly ( within 5 h ) , and the level of GATA-1 mRNA increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , the addition of GM-CSF to the M-TAT/EPO cell culture decreased the amount of hemoglobin , even in the presence of EPO , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the EPO signal for erythroid differentiation is suppressed by GM-CSF</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , erythroid development of M-TAT cells is promoted by EPO and suppressed by GM-CSF .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results support the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that EPO actively influences the programming of gene expression required for erythroid progenitor cell differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
