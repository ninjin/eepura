<sentence id="0">Activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B by phagocytic stimuli in human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Phagocytosis represents an important physiological trigger for the inducible expression of several genes in human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we report that a DNA-binding activity primarily consisting of the classical NF-kappa B heterodimer , p50/RelA , is induced in phagocytosing neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Under these conditions , NF-kappa B activation was found to be a rapid and transient response , reaching a maximum by 10-15 min , and returning to near-basal levels by 30 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In neutrophils undergoing the phagocytosis of opsonized yeasts , the onset of NF-kappa B activation was paralleled by a decline in immunoreactive I kappa B-alpha protein levels , and the cellular I kappa B-alpha pool was replenished by 30 min , in agreement with our gel shift data .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We conclude that NF-kappa B activation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> constitute one of the mechanisms whereby the expression of kappa B-responsive genes is enhanced in phagocytosing neutrophils</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To our knowledge , this represents the first demonstration that phagocytic stimuli can induce NF-kappa B activation in human neutrophils .</sentence>
