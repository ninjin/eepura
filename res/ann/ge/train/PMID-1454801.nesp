<sentence id="0">Transcription of the hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer in erythroid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In the human genome , the erythroid-specific hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer regulates the transcription of the downstream beta-like globin genes 10-50 kilobases away .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mechanism of HS2 enhancer function is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> known</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The present study employs RNA protection assays to analyze the transcriptional status of the HS2 enhancer in transfected recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmids .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In erythroid K562 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is active , the HS2 sequence directs the synthesis of long enhancer transcripts that are initiated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">apparently</cue> from within the enhancer</scope> and elongated through the intervening DNA into the cis-linked CAT gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In nonerythroid HL-60 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is inactive , long enhancer transcripts are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> detectable</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Splitting the HS2 enhancer between two tandem Ap1 sites abolishes the synthesis of a group of long enhancer transcripts and results in loss of enhancer function and transcriptional silencing of the cis-linked CAT gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In directing the synthesis of RNA through the intervening DNA and the gene by a tracking and transcription mechanism , the HS2 enhancer <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> ( i ) open up the chromatin structure of a gene domain and ( ii ) deliver enhancer binding proteins to the promoter sequence</scope> where they <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> stimulate the transcription of the gene at the cap site</scope> .</sentence>
