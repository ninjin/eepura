<sentence id="0">GATA-1 and erythropoietin cooperate to promote erythroid cell survival by regulating bcl-xL expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for normal erythropoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">By examining in vitro-differentiated embryonic stem cells , we showed previously that in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of GATA-1</scope> , committed erythroid precursors <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">fail</cue> to complete maturation</scope> and instead undergo apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="2"> The mechanisms by which GATA-1 controls cell survival are <cue type="spec" id="2">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we report that in erythroid cells , GATA-1 strongly induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xL , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> the related proteins bcl-2 and mcl-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistent with a role for bcl-xL in mediating GATA-1-induced erythroid cell survival , in vitro-differentiated bcl-xL-/- embryonic stem cells <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">fail</cue> to generate viable mature definitive erythroid cells , a phenotype resembling that of GATA-1 gene disruption</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , we show that erythropoietin , which is also required for erythroid cell survival , cooperates with GATA-1 to stimulate bcl-xL gene expression and to maintain erythroid cell viability during terminal maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Together , our data show that bcl-xL is essential for normal erythroid development and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> a regulatory hierarchy in which bcl-xL is a critical downstream effector of GATA-1 and erythropoietin-mediated signals</scope> .</sentence>
