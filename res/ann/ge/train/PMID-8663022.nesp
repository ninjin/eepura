<sentence id="0">Octamer binding factors and their coactivator can activate the murine PU.1 ( spi-1 ) promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PU.1 ( spi-1 ) , a member of the Ets transcription factor family , is predominantly expressed in myeloid and B cells , activates many B cell and myeloid genes , and is critical for development of both of these lineages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Our previous studies ( Chen , H.M. , Ray-Gallet , D. , Zhang , P. , Hetherington , C.J. , Gonzalez , D.A. , Zhang , D.-E. , Moreau-Gachelin , F. , and Tenen , D.G. ( 1995 ) Oncogene 11 , 1549-1560 ) demonstrate that the PU.1 promoter directs cell type-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines , and that PU.1 activates its own promoter in an autoregulatory loop .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that the murine PU.1 promoter is also specifically and highly functional in B cell lines as well .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Oct-1 and Oct-2 can bind specifically to a site at base pair -55 in vitro , and this site is specifically protected in B cells in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in B cells ; an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the octamer site , and the PU.1 autoregulatory site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Finally , we show that the B cell coactivator OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B is only expressed in B cells and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in myeloid cells</scope> , and that OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B can transactivate the PU.1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This B cell restricted coactivator <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be responsible for the B cell specific expression of PU.1 mediated by the octamer site</scope> .</sentence>
