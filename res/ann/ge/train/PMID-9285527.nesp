<sentence id="0">The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD36 is required for oxidized low-density lipoprotein modulation of NF-kappaB activity by tumor necrosis factor-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The binding of oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( Ox LDL ) by monocyte-macrophages causes pleiotropic effects , including changes in gene expression , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to represent an early event in atherogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The integral membrane glycoprotein CD36 <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to play a physiological role in binding and uptake of Ox LDL by monocyte-macrophages</scope> , although <scope type="spec" id="2"> the molecular events associated with CD36-Ox LDL interaction are <cue type="spec" id="2">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To approach this issue , we used CD36 transfected Chinese hampster ovary ( CHO ) cells , exposed them to Ox LDL , and determined changes in the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We report here that Ox LDL enhanced DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts to an NF-kappaB sequence following activation of CD36-producing CHO cells with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This enhanced DNA binding activity was inhibited by coincubation of CD36 transfected cells with the human CD36-specific antibody OKM5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also determined that activation of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity required an intact carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic segment on CD36 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results support the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">idea</cue> that human CD36 mediates signal transduction events in response to Ox LDL</scope> .</sentence>
