<sentence id="0">Transcriptional repression of the interleukin-2 gene by vitamin D3 : direct inhibition of NFATp/AP-1 complex formation by a nuclear hormone receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T-lymphocyte proliferation is suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25(OH)2D3 ] , the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , and is associated with a decrease in interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , gamma interferon , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report here that 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in Jurkat cells is cycloheximide resistant , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on IL-2 expression by the vitamin D3 receptor ( VDR )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We therefore examined vitamin D3-mediated repression of activated IL-2 expression by cotransfecting Jurkat cells with IL-2 promoter/reporter constructs and a VDR overexpression vector and by DNA binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We delineated an element conferring both DNA binding by the receptor in vitro and 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression in vivo to a short 40-bp region encompassing an important positive regulatory element , NF-AT-1 , which is bound by a T-cell-specific transcription factor , NFATp , as well as by AP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="1">VDR DNA-binding mutants were <cue type="neg" id="1">unable</cue> to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo</scope> ; the VDR DNA-binding domain alone , however , bound the element but also <cue type="neg" id="2">could <scope type="neg" id="2">not</cue> repress IL-2 expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> DNA binding by VDR is necessary but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> sufficient to mediate IL-2 repression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">By combining partially purified proteins in vitro , we observed the loss of the bound NFATp/AP-1-DNA complex upon inclusion of VDR or VDR-retinoid X receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Order of addition and off-rate experiments <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> the VDR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer blocks NFATp/AP-1 complex formation and then stably associates with the NF-AT-1 element</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This direct inhibition by a nuclear hormone receptor of transcriptional activators of the IL-2 gene <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> provide a mechanistic explanation of how vitamin derivatives can act as potent immunosuppressive agents</scope> .</sentence>
