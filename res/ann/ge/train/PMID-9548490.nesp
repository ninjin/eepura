<sentence id="0">Differential induction of DNA-binding activities following CD19 cross-linking in human B lineage cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The B cell-specific cell surface molecule CD19 is expressed at all stages of B cell development , including normal plasma cells , and mediates signal transduction via interaction with cytoplasmic effector proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Cross-linking CD19 on early human B lineage cells induces the formation of a CD19/Vav/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex , tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and Vav , and activation of the Ras pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To further explore the ramifications of CD19 signaling , the current study examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> phosphorylation of Elk-1 , activation of activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , or activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) transcription factors occurred following CD19 cross-linking</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The cells used were the BLIN-1 pre-B cell line expressing low levels of cell surface mu heavy chain associated with surrogate light chain and the 1E8 immature B cell line expressing cell surface mu/kappa .</sentence>
