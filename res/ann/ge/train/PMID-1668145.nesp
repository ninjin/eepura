<sentence id="0">Every enhancer works with every promoter for all the combinations tested : <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> new regulatory pathways evolve by enhancer shuffling</scope> ?</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The promoters and enhancers of cell type-specific genes are often conserved in evolution , and hence one <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">expect</cue> that a given enhancer has evolved to work best with its own promoter</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While <scope type="spec" id="4"> this expectation <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be realized in some cases</scope> , we have <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> found evidence for it</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A total of 27 combinations of different promoters and enhancers were tested by transfection into cultured cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that the relative efficiency of the enhancers is approximately the same , irrespective of the type of promoter used , i.e. , there was <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> strong preference for any given enhancer/promoter combination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Notably , we do <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> see particularly strong transcription when the immunoglobulin kappa enhancer ( or the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer ) is used to activate a kappa gene promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">propose</cue> that a generally permissive enhancer/promoter interaction is of evolutionary benefit for higher eukaryotes</scope> : by enhancer shuffling , genes <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">could</cue> be easily brought under a new type of inducibility/cell type specificity</scope> .</sentence>
