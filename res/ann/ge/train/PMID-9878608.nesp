<sentence id="0">Reactivation of Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection from latency by expression of the ORF 50 transactivator , a homolog of the EBV R protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Kaposi 's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) , or human herpesvirus 8 , is a lymphotropic virus strongly linked to several AIDS-related neoplasms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The primary reservoir of infection consists of latently infected B lymphocytes and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> other mononuclear cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Viral reactivation from latency and spread from this lymphoid reservoir is <cue type="spec" id="1">presumably</cue> required for development of nonlymphoid tumors like KS</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that deregulated expression of a single viral gene , ORF 50 , which encodes a transactivator able to selectively upregulate delayed-early viral genes , suffices to disrupt latency and induce the lytic gene cascade in latently infected B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The identification of this gene opens the way to studies of the physiologic mechanisms controlling reactvation of KSHV from latency .</sentence>
