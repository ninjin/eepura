<sentence id="0">Involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in interleukin-8 production by human monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or Mycoplasma fermentans membrane lipoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) is a chemokine that belongs to the alpha-chemokine or CXC subfamily and is produced by a wide variety of human cells , including monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells ( PMN ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">IL-8 is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli , notably bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , but little is known about the mechanisms by which these agents mediate IL-8 induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this report , we show that Mycoplasma fermentans lipid-associated membrane proteins ( LAMPf ) induce the production of high levels of IL-8 by THP-1 ( human monocyte ) cells and PMN at the same extent as LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It was previously demonstrated that stimulation of monocytic cells with either LPS or LAMPf led to a series of common downstream signaling events , including the activation of protein tyrosine kinase and of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By using PD-98059 and SB203580 , two potent and selective inhibitors of MEK1 ( a kinase upstream of ERK1/2 ) and p38 , respectively , we have demonstrated that both ERK1/2 and p38 cascades play a key role in the production of IL-8 by monocytes and PMN stimulated with bacterial fractions .</sentence>
