<sentence id="0">Concomitant downregulation of IgH 3' enhancer activity and c-myc expression in a plasmacytoma x fibroblast environment : implications for dysregulation of translocated c-myc .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulation of immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) gene expression is controlled by a B cell-specific promoter , intronic enhancer and additional B cell-specific enhancer elements identified recently in the 3' end of the IgH locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One of the latter elements , the IgH 3' enhancer , is of particular interest : ( 1 ) it is B cell-specific and active only in late B cell development ; ( 2 ) in rodent plasmacytomas and in some human Burkitt 's lymphomas it is part of a locus control region ( LCR ) that is involved in deregulation of the c-myc oncogene as a result of translocation into the IgH locus ; and ( 3 ) it has been implicated in the mechanisms that control Ig gene class switch recombination .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have used a somatic cell hybridization approach to genetically analyse regulation of the activity of the IgH 3' enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When mouse MPC11 plasmacytoma cells , in which the IgH 3' enhancer is active , are fused with fibroblasts , Ig expression is extinguished at the level of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we show that in a MPC11 plasmacytoma x fibroblast environment , the IgH 3' enhancer is transcriptionally inactive .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we demonstrate that <scope type="neg" id="0">binding of several B cell-specific transcription factors , essential for IgH 3' enhancer activity , is <cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue></scope> , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> explain 3' enhancer inactivity</scope> , although the binding of repressors cannot be excluded .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , the high expression level of c-myc , characteristic of the parental MPC11 cells carrying the t(12 ; 15 ) translocation , is down-regulated in the hybrids to that in unfused fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , inactivation of the IgH 3' enhancer is a multifactorial process affecting several transcription factors that control the cell-specific and developmental activity of the enhancer .</sentence>
