<sentence id="0">Epstein-Barr virus binding to CD21 activates the initial viral promoter via NF-kappaB induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , an oncogenic human herpesvirus , binds to and infects normal human B lymphocytes via CD21 , the CR2 complement receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Studies of the mechanisms that enable EBV to infect nonactivated , noncycling B cells provide compelling evidence for a sequence of events in which EBV binding to CD21 on purified resting human B cells rapidly activates the NF-kappaB transcription factor , which , in turn , binds to and mediates transcriptional activation of Wp , the initial viral latent gene promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus , EBV binding to its cellular receptor on resting B cells triggers an NF-kappaB-dependent intracellular signaling pathway which is required for infection .</sentence>
