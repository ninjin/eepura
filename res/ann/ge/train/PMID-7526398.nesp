<sentence id="0">Separation of oxidant-initiated and redox-regulated steps in the NF-kappa B signal transduction pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Studies presented here show that overall NF-kappa B signal transduction begins with a parallel series of stimuli-specific pathways through which cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ) , oxidants ( hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin C ) , and phorbol ester ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) individually initiate signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These initial pathways culminate in a common pathway through which all of the stimulating agents ultimately signal NF-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We distinguish the stimuli-specific pathways by showing that the oxidative stimuli trigger NF-kappa B activation in only one of two human T-cell lines ( Wurzburg but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> Jurkat )</scope> , whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate readily stimulate in both lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> the common pathway as the simplest way of accounting for the common requirements and properties of the signaling pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We include a redox-regulatory mechanism(s) in this common pathway to account for the previously demonstrated redox regulation of NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat cells ( in which oxidants do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">n't</cue> activate NF-kappa B )</scope> ; we put tyrosine phosphorylation in the common pathway by showing that kinase activity ( inhibitable by herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 ) is required for NF-kappa B activation by all stimuli tested in both cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the cytokine-stimulated activation of NF-kappa B , and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants , these findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that intracellular redox status controls NF-kappa B activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event(s) within the common step of the NF-kappa B signal transduction pathway</scope> .</sentence>
