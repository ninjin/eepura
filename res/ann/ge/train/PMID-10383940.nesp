<sentence id="0">STAT1 activation during monocyte to macrophage maturation : role of adhesion molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human monocytes isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors show a time-dependent differentiation into macrophages upon in vitro cultivation , closely mimicking their in vivo migration and maturation into extravascular tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mediator(s) of this maturation process has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been yet defined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We investigated the involvement of signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) factors in this phenomenon and reported the specific , time-dependent , activation of STAT1 protein starting at day 0/1 of cultivation and maximally expressed at day 5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">STAT1 activity was evident on the STAT binding sequences ( SBE ) present in the promoters of genes which are up-regulated during monocyte to macrophage maturation such as FcgammaRI and ICAM-1 , and in the promoter of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , the effect of cell adhesion to fibronectin or laminin was studied to investigate mechanisms involved in STAT1 activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Compared with monocytes adherent on plastic surfaces , freshly isolated cells allowed to adhere either to fibronectin- or laminin-coated flasks exhibited an increased STAT1 binding activity both in control and in IFN-gamma-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The molecular events leading to enhanced STAT1 activation and cytokine responsiveness concerned both Y701 and S727 STAT1 phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Exogenous addition of transforming growth factor-beta , which exerts an inhibitory effect on some monocytic differentiation markers , inhibited macrophage maturation , integrin expression and STAT1 binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together these results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> STAT1 plays a pivotal role in the differentiation/maturation process of monocytes as an early transcription factor initially activated by adherence and then able to modulate the expression of functional genes , such as ICAM-1 and FcgammaRI</scope> .</sentence>
