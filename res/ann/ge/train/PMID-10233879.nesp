<sentence id="0">Transcriptional targeting of retroviral vectors to the erythroblastic progeny of transduced hematopoietic stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Targeted expression to specific tissues or cell lineages is a necessary feature of a gene therapy vector for many clinical applications , such as correction of hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We developed retroviral vectors in which the constitutive viral enhancer in the U3 region of the 3' LTR is replaced by an autoregulatory enhancer of the erythroid-specific GATA-1 transcription factor gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The replaced enhancer is propagated to the 5' LTR upon integration into the target cell genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The modified vectors were used to transduce human hematopoietic cell lines , cord blood-derived CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells , and murine bone marrow repopulating stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The expression of appropriate reporter genes ( triangle upLNGFR , EGFP ) was analyzed in the differentiated progeny of transduced stem cells in vitro , in liquid culture as well as in clonogenic assay , and in vivo , after bone marrow transplantation in lethally irradiated mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The GATA-1 autoregulatory enhancer effectively restricts the expression of the LTR-driven proviral transcription unit to the erythroblastic progeny of both human progenitors and mouse-repopulating stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="0">Packaging of viral particles , integration into the target genome , and stability of the integrated provirus are <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affected by the LTR modification</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Enhancer replacement is therefore an effective strategy to target expression of a retroviral transgene to a specific progeny of transduced hematopoietic stem cells .</sentence>
