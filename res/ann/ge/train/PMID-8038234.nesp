<sentence id="0">IL-4 down-regulates IL-2- , IL-3- , and GM-CSF-induced cytokine gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-4 , a product of the T-helper 0 ( Th0 ) and 2 ( Th2 ) subset , was originally described as a B-cell stimulatory factor and has subsequently been found to suppress IL-1 alpha , IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-alpha gene expression in monocytes stimulated with LPS , and to upregulate IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL1-RA ) gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study we investigated the effect of IL-4 on the expression of cytokine genes in monocytes evoked by other T-helper cell cytokines : IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IL-4 down-regulated mRNA accumulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta , IL-8 , and TNF-alpha in monocytes stimulated with IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IL-4 also suppressed the IL-2-induced IL-6 mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Temporal analysis of the IL-4 down-regulatory effect on the IL-2- , IL-3- , or GM-CSF-induced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in monocytes provided evidence that IL-4 acts predominantly on the post-transcriptional level .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This was supported by the observation that the down-regulatory capacity of IL-4 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">IL-4 did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> exert significant influence on the induction of expression of IL-1-RA or various CSFs by IL-2 , IL-3 , and GM-CSF</scope> .</sentence>
