<sentence id="0">Overexpression of protein kinase C-zeta stimulates leukemic cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A function for protein kinase C-zeta ( PKC-zeta ) , a member of the phorbol ester nonresponsive atypical protein kinase C subfamily , in modulating differentiation was examined in the leukemic U937 cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transfected U937 cells stably overexpressing PKC-zeta displayed a longer doubling time , lower saturation density at confluency , and an increase in adherence to plastic as compared to control cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">PKC-zeta cells expressed a more differentiated phenotype as assessed by changes in morphology , surface antigen expression , and lysosomal enzyme activities and were distinct from parental U937 cells stimulated to differentiate by exposure to phorbol esters .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast to parental U937 cells , PKC-zeta cells constitutively expressed mRNA transcripts for c-jun and a low mobility AP-1 binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , PKC-zeta overexpression stimulates a type of phenotypic differentiation that differs significantly from maturation occurring upon activation of other PKC subfamilies induced by phorbol ester treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Increased expression of the c-jun protooncogene and an increase in AP-1 binding activity in PKC-zeta cells provides a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> mechanism for explaining the altered differentiation status of this cell</scope> .</sentence>
