<sentence id="0">Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 transcription : role of the 5'-untranslated leader region ( review ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) transcription is dependent on the interaction of host-cell transcription factors with cis-regulatory DNA elements within the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Much attention has focused on the series of sequence elements upstream of the transcriptional initiation site in the U3 region of the LTR including the Sp1 and NF-kappaB binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recent studies , however , demonstrate that the transcribed 5'-untranslated leader region ( 5'-UTR ) also contains important transcriptional elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These regulatory elements situated downstream of transcription interact with constitutive and inducible transcription factors , mediate transmission of cellular activation signals , and are important for efficient HIV-1 transcription and replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The 5'-UTR contains binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 , NF-kappaB , NF-AT , IRF , and Sp1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutations in these binding sites can interfere with the viral response to cell activation signals , decrease LTR transcription , and inhibit viral replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The 5'-UTR also interacts with a specific nucleosome that is rapidly displaced during transcriptional activation of the latent provirus .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that the inducible transcription factor binding sites in the 5'-UTR comprise a downstream enhancer domain that can function <scope type="spec" id="1"> independent of , <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> in concert with</scope> , the LTR promoter to rapidly increase latent proviral transcription in response to cell activation signals</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In this review , we describe the host-cell transcription factors that interact with the 5'-UTR and discuss their role in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression .</sentence>
