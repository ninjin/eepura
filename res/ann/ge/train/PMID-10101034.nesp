<sentence id="0">Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 expression by 4-trifluoromethyl derivatives of salicylate , triflusal , and its deacetylated metabolite , 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The therapeutic potential of drugs that block the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 has been emphasized .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">When two 4-trifluoromethyl salicylate derivatives [ 2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid ( triflusal ) and its deacetylated metabolite 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid ( HTB ) ] were compared with aspirin and sodium salicylate as cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors , we observed that in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-activated human blood , triflusal , aspirin , and HTB , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> sodium salicylate</scope> , inhibited COX-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production ( IC50 = 0.16 , 0.18 , 0.39 , and > 10 mM , respectively ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , only triflusal and aspirin inhibited purified COX-2 enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To test this apparent discrepancy , we realized that HTB and triflusal ( but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">neither</cue> aspirin <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">nor</cue> salicylate )</scope></scope> produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of COX-2 protein expression in peripheral human mononuclear cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This observation was further confirmed in a rat air pouch model in vivo , in which both aspirin and triflusal inhibited PGE2 production ( ID50 = 18.9 and 11.4 mg/kg p.o. , respectively ) but only triflusal-treated animals showed a decrease in COX-2 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This different behavior <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be , at least in part , due to the ability of HTB and triflusal to block the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB to a higher extent than aspirin and sodium salicylate</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , in addition to inhibiting the COX-2 activity at therapeutic concentrations , triflusal is able to block through its metabolite HTB the expression of new enzyme , and hence the resumption of PGE2 synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Triflusal and HTB <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> exert beneficial effects in processes in which de novo COX-2 expression is involved and , in a broader sense , in pathological situations in which genes under nuclear factor-kappaB control are up-regulated</scope> .</sentence>
