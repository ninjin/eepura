<sentence id="0">HIV-1 Vpr suppresses immune activation and apoptosis through regulation of nuclear factor kappa B [ see comments ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The HIV-1 accessory gene product Vpr can influence viral pathogenesis by affecting viral replication as well as host cell transcription and proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have investigated the effects of Vpr on host cell activation and confirm that it influences cellular proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , we have also found that Vpr modulates T-cell receptor (TCR)-triggered apoptosis in a manner similar to that of glucocorticoids .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of TCR-mediated activation</scope> , Vpr induces apoptosis whereas in its presence , Vpr interrupts the expected induction of apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This regulation of apoptosis is linked to Vpr suppression of NF-kappa B activity via the induction of I kappa B , an inhibitor of NF-kappa B. Further , Vpr suppresses expression of IL-2 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF alpha and IL-4 , all of which are NF-kappa B-dependent .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The effects of Vpr could be reversed by RU486 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our finding that Vpr can regulate NF-kappa B supports the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that some aspects of viral pathogenesis are the consequence of cell dysregulation by Vpr.</scope></sentence>
