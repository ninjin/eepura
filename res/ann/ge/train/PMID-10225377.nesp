<sentence id="0">Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB by lipopolysaccharide in mononuclear leukocytes is prevented by inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In monocytes , lipopolysaccharide induces synthesis and activity of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This enzyme releases arachidonic acid and lyso-phospholipids from membranes which are metabolized to eicosanoids and platelet-activating-factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These lipid mediators increase activity of transcription factors and expression of cytokine genes <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> a function for cytosolic phospholipase A2 in signal transduction and inflammation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have shown previously that trifluoromethylketone inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 suppressed interleukin-1beta protein and steady-state mRNA levels in human lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , the subcellular mechanisms were analyzed by which trifluoromethylketones interfere with gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We found that they reduced the initial interleukin-1beta mRNA transcription rate through prevention of degradation of inhibitor-kappaB alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consequently , cytosolic activation , nuclear translocation and DNA-binding of nuclear factor-kappaB were decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Trifluoromethylketones ameliorate chronic inflammation in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , this therapeutic potency <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> reside in retention of inactive nuclear factor-kappaB in the cytosol thereby abrogating interleukin-1beta gene transcription</scope> .</sentence>
