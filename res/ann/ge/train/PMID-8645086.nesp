<sentence id="0">Heat shock induces HIV-1 replication in chronically infected promyelocyte cell line OM10.1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A long period of clinical latency before development of symptoms is characteristic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">OM10.1 , a promyelocyte cell line latently infected with HIV-1 , has been developed as a model for studying the mechanism of viral latency and the activation of virus expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that this latently infected cell line with heat shock at 42 degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high level of HIV-1 production <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> addition of any cytokines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The mechanism of activation was analyzed by using anti-TNF-alpha antibody and various inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although the TNF-alpha level in culture supernatants was below the sensitivity of an ELISA assay system , addition of anti-TNF-alpha antibody in culture medium could partially suppress the heat shock induced HIV-1 production .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Staurosporine ( PKC inhibitor ) , pentoxifylline ( NF-kappa B inhibitor ) , and Ro5-3335 ( HIV-1 Tat inhibitor ) also inhibited significantly the heat shock induced virus activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In particular , staurosporine achieved approximately 90 % inhibition of the HIV-1 antigen expression in heat shock-treated OM10.1 at a non-toxic concentration .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although <scope type="spec" id="1"> the mechanism of HIV-1 activation with heat shock has <cue type="spec" id="1">not</cue> been fully elucidated yet</scope> , it is presumed PKC plays an important role in HIV-1 activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , the present observations will provide a further insight into the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infections .</sentence>
