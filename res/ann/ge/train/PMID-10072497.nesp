<sentence id="0">N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibits primary human T cell responses at the dendritic cell level : association with NF-kappaB inhibition .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) is an antioxidant molecule endowed with immunomodulatory properties .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the effect of NAC on the induction phase of T cell responses , we analyzed its action on human dendritic cells ( DC ) derived from adherent PBMC cultured with IL-4 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We first found that NAC inhibited the constitutive as well as the LPS-induced activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In parallel , NAC was shown to down-regulate the production of cytokines by DC as well as their surface expression of HLA-DR , CD86 ( B7-2 ) , and CD40 molecules both at the basal state and upon LPS activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NAC also inhibited DC responses induced by CD40 engagement .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The inhibitory effects of NAC were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> due to nonspecific toxicity</scope> as <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">neither</cue> the viability of DC <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">nor</cue> their mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis were modified by NAC</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , we found that the addition of NAC to MLR between naive T cells and allogeneic DC resulted in a profound inhibition of alloreactive responses , <scope type="spec" id="4"> which <cue type="spec" id="4">could</cue> be attributed to a defect of DC</scope> as <scope type="neg" id="3">APC-independent T cell responses were <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> inhibited by NAC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Altogether , our results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that NAC <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">might</cue> impair the generation of primary immune responses in humans through its inhibitory action on DC</scope></scope> .</sentence>
