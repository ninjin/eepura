<sentence id="0">A lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor containing c-Rel-like proteins preferentially interacts with interleukin-6 kappa B-related motifs whose activities are repressed in lymphoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The proto-oncoprotein c-Rel is a member of the nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor family , which includes the p50 and p65 subunits of nuclear factor kappa B. We show here that c-Rel binds to kappa B sites as homodimers as well as heterodimers with p50 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These homodimers and heterodimers show distinct DNA-binding specificities and affinities for various kappa B motifs .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In particular , the c-Rel homodimer has a high affinity for interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and beta interferon kappa B sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In spite of its association with p50 in vitro , however , we found a lymphoid cell-specific nuclear factor in vivo that contains c-Rel but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> p50 epitopes</scope> ; <scope type="spec" id="1"> this factor , termed IL-6 kappa B binding factor II , <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to contain the c-Rel homodimer</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">preferentially</cue> recognizes several IL-6 kappa B-related kappa B motifs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although it has been previously shown that the IL-6 kappa B motif functions as a potent IL-1/tumor necrosis factor-responsive element in nonlymphoid cells , its activity was found to be repressed in lymphoid cells such as a Jurkat T-cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also present evidence that IL-6 kappa B binding factor II functions as a repressor specific for IL-6 kappa B-related kappa B motifs in lymphoid cells .</sentence>
