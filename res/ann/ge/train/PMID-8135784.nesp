<sentence id="0">Characterization of NF(P) , the nuclear factor that interacts with the regulatory P sequence ( 5'-CGAAAATTTCC-3 ' ) of the human interleukin-4 gene : relationship to NF-kappa B and NF-AT .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The P sequence of the human interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) gene , which was defined as a responsive element for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in Jurkat T cells , shares sequence similarity with the NF-kappa B and the NF-AT binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> NF(P) , a nuclear factor specific for the P sequence , is related to NF-kappa B and NF-AT</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">NF-kappa B ( P65 or P65/P50 heterodimer ) bound to the P sequence in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) and activated transcription through the P sequence when expression plasmids were cotransfected with P sequence-driven reporter plasmids in Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In EMSAs , NF(P) binding was inhibited by the unlabeled NF-AT binding site but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> by the unlabeled AP1 binding site</scope> and purified NF-AT contained an activity that bound to the P sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both mobility shift and sequence specificity of NF-AT were similar to those of NF(P) and only a small amount of P65 was detected in NF(P) in crude nuclear extracts .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> the component(s) of NF-AT has the potential to reconstitute NF(P) whereas NF-kappa B alone cannot account for NF(P) in crude extracts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Unlike NF-AT , NF(P) does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> contain AP1 as its DNA binding component</scope> .</sentence>
