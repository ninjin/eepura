<sentence id="0">Requirements for induction of vitamin D-mediated gene regulation in normal human B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mature human lymphocytes are unique targets of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25(OH)2D3 ) in that vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> constitutively expressed</scope> , and specific cellular activation signals are required for both the up-regulation of VDR and establishment of reactivity to the lipophilic ligand .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Treatment of B lymphocytes with the cytokine IL-4 ( IL-4 ) , in the absence of prior activation , induces a weak up-regulation of VDR expression but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">fails</cue> to generate vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE)-reactive nuclear protein complexes or to initiate the genomic transcription of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Stimulation of B lymphocytes by either ligation of CD40 Ag or cross-linking the Ig receptor is also insufficient to render B lymphocytes responsive to 1 alpha , 25(OH)2D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , <scope type="spec" id="4"> this <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">apparent</cue> <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> of response to the secosterol</scope></scope> <cue type="spec" id="4">can</cue> be overcome by stimulation of B lymphocytes with a combination of these cellular activation signals</scope> , which are sufficient to lead to G1 cell cycle progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the presence of 1 alpha , 25(OH)2D3 , <scope type="spec" id="5"> cellular activation associated with stimulation of such a progression <cue type="spec" id="5">appears</cue> to be sufficient for the up-regulation of VDR message and protein and necessary for the establishment of VDRE binding complexes and the induction of 24-hydroxylase message</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , biologic functions are modulated , in that the hormone inhibits proliferation in a subset of the activated B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These observations <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that reactivity to 1 alpha , 25(OH)2D3 is tightly regulated in B lymphocytes , requiring specific signals for its initiation</scope> .</sentence>
