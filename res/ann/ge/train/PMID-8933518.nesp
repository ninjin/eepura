<sentence id="0">Tissue and cell-type specific expression of the tuberous sclerosis gene , TSC2 , in human tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">TSC2 is a gene on chromosome 16p13.3 associated with the autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder , tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">By using a partial nucleotide sequence from the cloned TSC2 and polymerase chain reaction methodology , we constructed a digoxigenin-labeled complementary DNA probe to examine TSC2 gene expression in autopsy- or biopsy-derived human tissues by in situ hybridization .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TSC2 messenger RNA was widely expressed in various cell types throughout the body , including epithelia , lymphocytes , and cells with endocrine functions , e.g. , adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It was prominently and selectively ( within the central nervous system ) expressed in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and other motor neurons , e.g. , in spinal cord and brainstem nuclei .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Visceral TSC2 expression was comparable in autopsy tissues from patients with and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> TSC</scope> ; TSC2 messenger RNA expression was most prominent in cells with a rapid mitotic rate and turnover , e.g. , epithelia and lymphocytes , with central nervous system pyramidal cells and other neurons being an obvious exception , and/or in cells with important secretory/transport functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This widespread expression of the TSC2 gene supports the view that it encodes <scope type="spec" id="1"> a protein vital to cell growth and metabolism <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> one that functions as a tumor/growth suppressor</scope> .</sentence>
