<sentence id="1">Over the past several years , mounting evidence has shown that immune tolerance in healthy individuals can be maintained by a population of T lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As a component of this system , a protein known as Foxp3 has been shown to be absolutely required for the development and function of Tregs .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While Foxp3 plays an important role in maintaining immune tolerance by blocking T cell proliferation and production of inflammatory proteins known as cytokines , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are used by Foxp3 to accomplish these events .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The present study expands our understanding of how Foxp3 maintains a check on inappropriate immune responses by demonstrating that Foxp3 can block activation of key inducible proteins such as nuclear factor = = kappa==B ( NF-==kappa==B ) and cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since NF-==kappa==B and CREB are integrally involved in controlling cell cycle progression , inflammatory cytokine production , and the replication of numerous viruses at the level of transcription , understanding the mechanisms by which Foxp3 functions to regulate cellular and viral gene expression <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> aid in the discovery of therapeutic approaches designed to rescue the expression <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">and/or</cue> function of Foxp3</scope> , which have been found to be deficient in several autoimmune diseases and virus-induced disorders</scope> .</sentence>
