<sentence id="0">Interaction of transcription factors RFX1 and MIBP1 with the gamma motif of the negative regulatory element of the hepatitis B virus core promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The negative regulatory element ( NRE ) of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) core promoter contains three subregions which act synergistically to suppress core promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One of these subregions , NRE gamma , is active in both HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and Huh7 hepatoma cells and was found to be bound by a protein factor present in both cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that the transcription factor RFX1 can bind to NRE gamma and transactivate the core promoter through this site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutations which abrogated the gene-suppressive activity of NRE gamma prevented RFX1 from binding to NRE gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , RFX1 can bind simultaneously , most <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> as a heterodimer</scope> , with the transcription factor MIBP1 to NRE gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of a cloned MIBP1 gene for further studies</scope> , we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesize</cue> that RFX1 acts with MIBP1 to negatively regulate the core promoter activity through the NRE gamma site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The ability of RFX1 to transactivate the core promoter <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">raises the</cue> possibility that RFX1 <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> play a dual role in regulating HBV gene expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
