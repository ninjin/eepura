<sentence id="0">HLA class I-mediated induction of cell proliferation involves cyclin E-mediated inactivation of Rb function and induction of E2F activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chronic rejection of transplanted organs is manifested as atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the allograft .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HLA class I Ags have been implicated to play a major role in this process , since signaling via HLA class I molecules <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> induce the proliferation of aortic endothelial as well as smooth muscle cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we show that HLA class I-mediated induction of cell proliferation correlates with inactivation of the Rb protein in the T cell line Jurkat as well as human aortic endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb can be inhibited specifically by neutralizing Abs to basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a role for FGF receptors in the signaling process</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="3"> Signaling through HLA class I molecules induced cyclin E-associated kinase activity within 4 h in quiescent endothelial cells , and <cue type="spec" id="3">appeared</cue> to mediate the inactivation of Rb. A cdk2 inhibitor , Olomoucine , as well as a dominant-negative cdk2 construct prevented HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb ; in contrast , dominant-negative cdk4 and cdk6 constructs had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , there was <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> increase in cyclin D-associated kinase activity upon HLA class I ligation</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that cyclin E-dependent kinase activity mediates Rb inactivation , leading to E2F activation and cell proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
