<sentence id="0">Cell type- and stage-specific expression of the CD20/B1 antigen correlates with the activity of a diverged octamer DNA motif present in its promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The CD20(B1) gene encodes a B cell-specific protein involved in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Studies with 5' deletion CD20 promoter-CAT constructs have previously revealed two regions of the promoter between bases -186 and -280 and between bases -280 and -454 which contained positive regulatory elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study we identified a sequence element present in the most proximal region located between bases -214 and -201 , TTCTTCTAATTAA , which is important in the high constitutive expression of CD20 in mature B cells and the induction of CD20 in pre-B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This sequence element was referred to as the BAT box and its deletion significantly reduced the activity of a CD20 promoter-CAT construct in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mobility shift assays with various mutant probes and B cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that the core sequence TAAT was essential for binding to this site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cross competition experiments with an octamer sequence from the Ig heavy chain promoter , the BAT box , and a TA-rich sequence present in the CD21 promoter revealed that all three sequences bound the same nuclear proteins <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Southwestern blotting and UV cross-linking studies confirmed that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct-1 and Oct-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The affinity of the BAT box binding proteins for the BAT box was approximately 25-fold less than for the octamer sequence and the BAT box binding proteins dissociated from the BAT box 10-fold more rapidly than from the octamer sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Despite this lower affinity , a trimer of the BAT box sequence was as efficiently transactivated by an Oct-2 expression vector as was a trimer of the octamer sequence in HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The BAT box and Oct-2 were also implicated in the induction of CD20 in the pre-B cell line , PB-697 , via phorbol esters .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The induction of CD20 mRNA was temporally associated with induction of Oct-2 mRNA and a BAT box-deleted CD20-CAT construct , in contrast to the wild type , was poorly induced by phorbol esters .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Together these results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the BAT box binding proteins are important in the B cell specific expression of CD20 and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">perhaps</cue> CD21</scope></scope> .</sentence>
