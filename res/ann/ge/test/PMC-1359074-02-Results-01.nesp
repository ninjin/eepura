<sentence id="0">Persistent Expression of the Embryonic Globin , epsilony , in Sox6-Deficient Mice</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The epsilony globin gene was initially identified as an upregulated transcript in the p100H mouse using subtractive hybridization to identify Sox6 downstream targets .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This initial observation was confirmed in an independent knock-out allele of Sox6 [ 13 ] using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Real-time PCR was used to quantitate the expression levels of other globin genes in p100H mutant and WT mouse livers at two developmental stages , 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">As</cue> shown in Figure 1</scope> , the epsilony gene is expressed at high levels at both time points in mutant mice , in contrast to the decline in expression observed in WT mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">No</cue> difference was seen between WT and heterozygous mice</scope> ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , the expression levels of the other two embryonic globin genes ( zeta and betah1 ) are also higher in p100H homozygous mice , compared with WT mice , but to a much lesser extent than seen for epsilony globin at 18.5 dpc ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , the expression level of adult beta globin is also somewhat higher in p100H homozygous mice than in WT mice at 18.5 dpc ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Perinatal lethality of mutant mice ( <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">presumably</cue> from the heart defect [ 14 ] ) precludes us from evaluating postnatal globin expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The graphs in Figure 1 illustrate real time PCR results that were performed in triplicate ( standard deviation of the data is shown by error bars ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Because all of the assays were performed at the same time with the same internal control , the levels shown are relative levels and are thus comparable across all samples and are in agreement with previously published results for WT fetal mice [ 29 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We note that the level of epsilony expression in the livers of 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc homozygous mutant mice is statistically equivalent to the level of betamaj/min expression in the livers of 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc homozygous WT mice .</sentence>
