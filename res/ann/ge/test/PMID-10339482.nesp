<sentence id="0">Protein kinase B ( c-Akt ) , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and STAT5 are activated by erythropoietin ( EPO ) in HCD57 erythroid cells but are constitutively active in an EPO-independent , apoptosis-resistant subclone ( HCD57-SREI cells ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We found that erythropoietin ( EPO ) and stem cell factor ( SCF ) activated protein kinase B ( PKB/Akt ) in EPO-dependent HCD57 erythroid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To better understand signals controlling proliferation and viability , erythroid cells that resist apoptosis in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of EPO</scope> were subcloned and characterized ( HCD57-SREI cells ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Constitutive activations of PKB/Akt , STAT5a , and STAT5b were noted in these EPO-independent cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PI3-kinase activity was an upstream activator of PKB/Akt because the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked both constitutive PKB/Akt and factor-dependent PKB/Akt activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The LY294002 study showed that proliferation and viability of both HCD57-SREI and HCD57 cells correlated with the activity of PKB/Akt ; however , PKB/Akt activity alone did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> protect these cells from apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Treatment of HCD57 cells with SCF also activated PKB/Akt , but did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> protect from apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This result <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggested</cue> that PKB/PI3-kinase activity is necessary but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> sufficient to promote viability and/or proliferation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Constitutive STAT5 activity , activated through an <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">unknown</cue> pathway not including JAK2 or EPOR</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> act in concert with the constitutive PI3-kinase/PKB/Akt pathway to protect the EPO-independent HCD57-SREI cells from apoptosis and promote limited proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
