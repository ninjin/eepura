<sentence id="0">Nuclear factor-90 of activated T-cells : A double-stranded RNA-binding protein and substrate for the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase , PKR .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NFAT transcription factors play a central role in initiating T-cell activation through the induction of immediate-early T-cell specific genes including interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">NFAT transcription factors bind to a sequence in the IL-2 enhancer known as the antigen receptor response element 2 ( ARRE-2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Multiple proteins exhibiting ARRE-2 binding activity have been isolated , including a heterodimer from stimulated T-cell nuclear extracts consisting of Mr = 90 000 ( NF90 ) and Mr = 45 000 ( NF45 ) subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The subunits of this heterodimer have been cloned , and NF90 was found to encode a protein containing two domains <scope type="spec" id="0"> that are <cue type="spec" id="0">predicted</cue> to form motifs capable of binding to double-stranded RNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using in vitro translated polypeptides , we have demonstrated that NF90 specifically binds to double-stranded RNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , NF90 was phosphorylated in a double-stranded RNA-dependent manner <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> by the interferon-induced , double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase , PKR</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The NF90 protein was found to be expressed <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> only in T-cells</scope> , but also in nonimmune HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In HeLa cells , the protein was almost exclusively localized to the ribosome salt wash fraction of cell lysates .</sentence>
