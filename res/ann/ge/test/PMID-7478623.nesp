<sentence id="0">Bik , a novel death-inducing protein shares a distinct sequence motif with Bcl-2 family proteins and interacts with viral and cellular survival-promoting proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The survival-promoting activity of the Bcl-2 family of proteins <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be modulated by interactions between various cellular proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have identified a novel cellular protein , Bik , that interacts with the cellular survival-promoting proteins , Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL , as well as the viral survival-promoting proteins , Epstein Barr virus-BHRF1 and adenovirus E1B-19 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In transient transfection assays , Bik promotes cell death in a manner similar to the death-promoting members of the Bcl-2 family , Bax and Bak .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This death-promoting activity of Bik can be suppressed by coexpression of Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , EBV-BHRF1 and E1B-19 kDa proteins <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that Bik <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be a common target for both cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While Bik does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> show overt homology to the BH1 and BH2 conserved domains characteristic of the Bcl-2 family</scope> , it does share a 9 amino acid domain ( BH3 ) with Bax and Bak which <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a critical determinant for the death-promoting activity of these proteins</scope> .</sentence>
