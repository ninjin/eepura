<sentence id="0">Decreased concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets : effect of phosphate supplementation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Abnormal renal tubular phosphate transport is considered to be the primary defect in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( XLH ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the resistance to vitamin D treatment in XLH cannot be explained by hypophosphatemia alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Since most of the actions of vitamin D are mediated by its receptors ( VDR ) , abnormalities of VDR have been postulated in XLH .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In order to investigate this <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibility</cue> , we measured the concentration of VDR in PHA-activated peripheral mononuclear cells from 10 XLH patients</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Patients <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> phosphate supplementation</scope> showed significantly lower concentration ( 21.7 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg protein , mean +/- SEM ) compared to the normal controls ( 60.7 +/- 4.0 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the contrary , there was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> significant difference between the phosphate-supplemented patients ( 58.3 +/- 2.7 ) and controls</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">There was a significant positive correlation between VDR concentration and serum phosphate ( P less than 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In two patients , VDR was increased after daily phosphate supplementation was started .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> a decreased concentration of VDR secondary to persistent hypophosphatemia is one of the causes of vitamin D resistance in XLH</scope> .</sentence>
