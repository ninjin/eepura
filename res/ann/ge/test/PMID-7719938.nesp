<sentence id="0">The role of shared receptor motifs and common Stat proteins in the generation of cytokine pleiotropy and redundancy by IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-13 , and IL-15 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To understand the molecular bases for cytokine redundancy and pleiotropy , we have compared the Stat proteins activated in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) by cytokines with shared and distinct actions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) rapidly activated Stat5 in fresh PBL , and Stat3 and Stat5 in preactivated PBL .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IL-7 and IL-15 induced the same complexes as IL-2 , a feature explained by the existence of similar tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R beta and IL-7R that can serve as docking sites for Stat proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IL-13 Induced the same complexes as IL-4 , a finding explained by our studies implicating IL-4R as a shared component of the receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These studies demonstrate that a single cytokine can activate different combinations of Stat proteins under different physiological conditions , and also <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate</cue> two mechanisms by which distinct cytokines can activate the same Stat protein</scope> .</sentence>
