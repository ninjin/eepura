<sentence id="0">Inhibition of the differentiation of human myeloid cell lines by redox changes induced through glutathione depletion .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have investigated the effect of redox changes in vivo on the differentiation of two human myeloid cell lines , HL-60 and KG-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The glutathione-depleting agent diethyl maleate ( DEM ) prevented the development of differentiated features in response to phorbol esters , including adherence of the cells to plastic surfaces and repression of the myeloperoxidase and CD34 genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , DEM abolished phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced activation of the transcription factors AP-1 and Egr-1 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that inhibition of differentiation <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be due , at least in part</scope></scope> , to redox modifications of these proteins .</sentence>
