<sentence id="0">Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-dependent and ERK-independent pathways target STAT3 on serine-727 in human neutrophils stimulated by chemotactic factors and cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) is a latent transcription factor that is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation ( Tyr-705 ) in cells stimulated with cytokines or growth factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recent studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that one or more cytoplasmic serine kinases also phosphorylate STAT3 and are necessary for maximal gene activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we demonstrate , with a site-specific antibody , that STAT3 is phosphorylated on Ser-727 in human neutrophils stimulated with chemotactic factors ( N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and complement C5a ) , cytokines [ granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) ] , or a protein kinase C activator ( PMA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">(2-Amino-3'-methoxyphenyl)oxanaphthalen-4-one ( PD 98059 ) , an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( ERK ) activation , blocked the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by chemotactic factors or PMA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The drug was less effective on cytokines : it virtually abolished the response to GM-CSF that occurred 5 min after stimulation but only partly decreased those at 15-30 min and did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> appreciably alter responses to G-CSF regardless of incubation time</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">1-(5-Isoquinolinylsulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride ( H7 ) , an inhibitor of a putative STAT3 serine kinase , and 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulphinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) 1H-imidazole ( SB 203580 ) , an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase , did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> dampen any of these serine phosphorylation responses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that neutrophils use both ERK-dependent and ERK-independent pathways to phosphorylate Ser-727 on STAT3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The former pathway is recruited by all ERK-activating stimuli , whereas the latter pathway uses an undefined serine kinase and is recruited selectively by cytokines .</sentence>
