<sentence id="0">High expression of SOCS1 mRNA in RA CD4+ T cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-6 induces two potent inhibitors of JAKs ( SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins ) that not only act as mediators of negative feedback inhibition , but also play a major role in crosstalk inhibition by opposing other cytokine-signaling pathways [ 7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">SOCS3 has recently been shown to specifically inhibit STAT3 activation induced by IL-6 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> by IL-10</scope> , thereby regulating the divergent action of IL-6 and IL-10 [ 8,9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">On the contrary , SOCS1 is able to partially inhibit IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation and cellular responses , as well as IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 activation [ 32 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> SOCSs were involved in the defective IL-10-induced STAT3 activation of RA CD4+ T cells</scope> , the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expression in PB CD4+ T cells from active RA patients and from healthy controls were compared by semiquantitative real-time PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The RA CD4+ T cells contained higher levels of SOCS1 but lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts than did control CD4+ T cells ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">6a ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Constitutive expression of SOCS1 mRNA in RA CD4+ T cells was comparable with the expression in normal CD4+ T cells stimulated by 10 ng/ml IL-6 ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">6b ) , supporting its functional significance .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="2"> Defective IL-10-induced STAT3 activation therefore <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to be due at least in part to an abundance of SOCS1 in RA CD4+ T cells</scope> .</sentence>
