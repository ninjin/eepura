<sentence id="0">Conclusion</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD4+ T cells from active RA patients are characterized by their resistance to IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma production , due to constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation and impaired IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The defective STAT3 signaling is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> associated with SOCS1 predominance over SOCS3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="1"> These abnormalities in active RA are <cue type="spec" id="1">thought</cue> to be induced mainly after chronic exposure to high concentrations of IL-6</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="2"> The limited efficacy of IL-10 treatment of RA patients [ 50 ] <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be explained in part by the unresponsiveness to IL-10 of inflammatory cells , including T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">On the contrary , the therapeutic efficacy of anti-IL-6 receptor antibody has been reported in RA patients [ 51 ] , and one of the effects of this therapy <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be to normalize T cells through the inhibition of IL-6-dependent STAT3 activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">More specific therapy targeting STAT3 activation will be awaited ; for example , the induction of the SOCS3 gene , the efficacy of which has been demonstrated in animal models [ 37 ] .</sentence>
