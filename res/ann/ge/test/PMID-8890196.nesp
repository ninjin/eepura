<sentence id="0">CD14-mediated signal pathway of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in human gingival fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces expression of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes/macrophages via CD14 , one of the LPS receptors , which is expressed predominantly in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has been demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS ( P-LPS ) also is able to induce inflammatory cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Therefore , it is important to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> CD14 is expressed in gingival fibroblasts</scope> and to define the P-LPS-mediated signal-transducing mechanism in the cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we observed unexpectedly by immunohistochemical , Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) , and Northern ( RNA ) blotting assays that CD14 is expressed at high density in human gingival fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">P-LPS-induced expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) gene in the cells was inhibited markedly by treatment with anti-human CD14 antibody and was completely inhibited by herbimycin A , a potent inhibitor of tyrosine kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The inhibitor also dramatically inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity of and MCP-1 production by the cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , P-LPS-induced expression of the MCP-1 gene in the cells also was blocked by inhibitors of two transcription factors , i.e. , curcumin , an inhibitor of AP-1 , and pyrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor of NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Both inhibitors inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity in the culture supernatant of P-LPS-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Gel shift mobility assay showed stimulation of the AP-1 and NF-kappaB contents in P-LPS-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This study is the first to demonstrate the expression of CD14 in human gingival fibroblasts and to show that the signal-transducing pathway of P-LPS in the cells is mediated by CD14 .</sentence>
