<sentence id="0">Analysis of the modulation of transcriptional activity in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is still associated with a mortality of 60 to 80 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">AML is characterized by a block in myeloid differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBPalpha are responsible for normal myeloid differentiation from stem cells to monocytes or granulocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In particular , PU.1 induces expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) receptor and the development of monocytes , whereas C/EBPalpha increases the expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) receptor and leads to mature granulocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In AML , chromosomal aberrations result in oncoproteins such as AML1/ETO , PML/RARalpha , or activated Ras , which can deregulate genes important for normal myelopoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , AML1/ETO can bind to the transcription factor C/EBPalpha , inhibit C/EBPalpha-dependent transcription , and block granulocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , AML1/ETO can also synergize with the transcription factor AML1 to enhance the activity of the M-CSF receptor promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">On the other hand , the PML/RARalpha fusion protein causes transcriptional repression by recruiting the nuclear corepressor ( N-CoR ) histone deacetylase complex to the DNA , which results in decreased histone acetylation and a repressive chromatin organization .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Here we describe methods to investigate <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> and how signaling agonists induce myeloid differentiation and how oncoproteins <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> cause AML by modulating the activity of transcription factors that are pivotal for normal myeloid development</scope></scope> .</sentence>
