<sentence id="0">Estrogen and progesterone induction of survival of monoblastoid cells undergoing TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Induction of apoptosis of mononucleated cells is a physiological process for regulating the intensity of the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The female steroid hormones estrogen ( E2 ) and progesterone ( Prog ) are known to modulate the reactivity of the immune system ; recently it has been demonstrated that they can regulate induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells and osteoblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TNF-alpha-mediated induction of apoptosis has been well characterized in myeloid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> E2 and Prog <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> interfere with TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of the monoblastoid U937 cell line</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment with E2 or Prog increased survival and prevented apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha in both undifferentiated and macrophage-like PMA-differentiated U937 cells , as assessed by trypan blue exclusion cell counting , thymidine incorporation , AnnexinV labeling , followed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This effect can be associated with the activation of specific hormone receptors , since we observed the expression of the estrogen receptor alpha ( ER-alpha ) , ER-beta , and progesterone receptor ( PR ) mRNAs ; the ER-alpha protein expression was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , hormone-mediated survival against apoptosis was concentration dependent , reaching the half-maximal effect at 10 nM and blocked by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 in undifferentiated cells , further supporting a receptor-mediated mechanism of cell survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Other steroid receptor drugs such as Raloxifene , RU486 , or the ICI 182,780 in PMA-differentiated cells displayed agonist activity by preventing TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis as efficiently as the hormones alone , providing further evidence to the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">notion</cue> that steroid receptor drugs <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> manifest agonist or antagonist activities depending on the cellular context in which they are studied</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Treatment with E2 was also associated with a time-dependent decrease in the mRNA level of the proapoptotic Nip-2 protein , supporting the <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">hypothesis</cue> that hormone responsiveness of U937 cells is mediated by target gene transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Together , these results demonstrate that ER and PR can be activated by endogenous or exogenous ligands to induce a genetic response that impairs TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The data presented here <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that the female steroid receptors play a role in regulation of the immune response by preventing apoptosis of monoblastoid cells ; this effect <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">might</cue> have important consequences in the clinical use of steroid receptor drugs</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">--Vegeto , E. , Pollio , G. , Pellicciari , C. , Maggi , A. Estrogen and progesterone induction of survival of monoblastoid cells undergoing TNF-alpha-inuced apoptosis .</sentence>
