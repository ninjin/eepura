<sentence id="0">Does activation of the TAL1 gene occur in a majority of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ?</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A pediatric oncology group study .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Almost 25 % of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) have tumor-specific rearrangements of the TAL1 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although TAL1 expression has not been observed in normal lymphocytes , TAL1 gene products are readily detected in leukemic cells that harbor a rearranged TAL1 allele .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Hence , it has been proposed that ectopic expression of TAL1 promotes the development of T-ALL .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this report , we show that TAL1 is expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T-ALL , including many that do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> display an apparent TAL1 gene alteration</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of TAL1 was used to determine the allele specificity of TAL1 transcription in primary T-ALL cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Monoallelic expression of TAL1 was observed in the leukemic cells of all patients ( 8 of 8 ) bearing a TAL1 gene rearrangement .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In the leukemic cells of patients <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> detectable TAL1 rearrangements</scope> , TAL1 transcription occurred in either a monoallelic ( 3 of 7 patients ) or a biallelic ( 4 of 7 patients ) fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , TAL1 activation in these patients <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> result from subtle alterations in cis-acting regulatory sequences ( affecting expression of a single TAL1 allele ) or changes in trans-acting factors that control TAL1 transcription ( affecting expression of both TAL1 alleles</scope> ) .</sentence>
