<sentence id="1">IL-10 affects monocytes and T cells by driving the progression of immune responsiveness such that Th2 lymphocyte-mediated effects predominate .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this report , we show that in monocytes and T cells IL-10 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription , STAT1 alpha and STAT3 , in a differential manner such that the relative formation of homo- and heterodimers varies between the two cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , monocytes express a novel IL-10-stimulated STAT protein with an M(r) of 70 kDa that is recognized by the anti-STAT3 Ab but <scope type="neg" id="0">is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> observed in T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IL-10 treatment of both T cells and monocytes results in the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 and Jak1 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> Jak2 or Jak3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Selective modulation of immune responsiveness by IL-10 in cells such as monocytes and T cells <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> result in part from the differential activation of STAT protein pairs</scope> .</sentence>
