<sentence id="0">Sox6 Directly Silences Epsilon Globin Expression in Definitive Erythropoiesis</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Sox6 is a member of the Sox transcription factor family that is defined by the conserved high mobility group ( HMG ) DNA binding domain , first described in the testis determining gene , Sry .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that Sox6 plays a role in the development of the central nervous system , cartilage , and muscle</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the Sox6-deficient mouse , p100H , epsilony globin is persistently expressed , and increased numbers of nucleated red cells are present in the fetal circulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transfection assays in GM979 ( erythroleukemic ) cells define a 36-base pair region of the epsilony proximal promoter that is critical for Sox6 mediated repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays demonstrate that Sox6 acts as a repressor by directly binding to the epsilony promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The normal expression of Sox6 in wild-type fetal liver and the ectopic expression of epsilony in p100H homozygous fetal liver demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The present study shows that Sox6 is required for silencing of epsilony globin in definitive erythropoiesis and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> a role for Sox6 in erythroid cell maturation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , Sox6 regulation of epsilony globin <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> provide a novel therapeutical target in the treatment of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Synopsis</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Beta-globin gene switching-the transition from embryonic to fetal to adult synthesis of specific globin chains-results in hemoglobins with different affinity for oxygen .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This system is a longstanding paradigm for developmental biology and is directly relevant to human disease , since small amounts of normal embryonic or fetal beta-globins <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">can</cue> " balance " the detrimental effect of abnormal or missing adult globins in diseases such as sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In the current study , the transcription factor Sox6 was identified as a novel and crucial silencing factor of epsilon ( embryonic ) globin through a somewhat serendipitous pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The authors had previously identified a chromosomal inversion , p100H , by virtue of its effect on the pink-eyed dilution gene and found that the same inversion also disrupts the Sox6 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Using p100H mutant mice as a tool for identifying downstream targets of Sox6 , the authors discovered that epsilon-globin levels were dramatically elevated , paving the way for a series of molecular genetic experiments demonstrating that Sox6 directly binds to and normally inhibits transcription from the epsilon-globin gene promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">This work provides fundamental new insights into regulation of globin gene transcription during development , and provides new clues for manipulating globin gene transcription as an approach to treat human blood diseases .</sentence>
