<sentence id="0">CD40 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> lipopolysaccharide and anti-IgM stimulation of primary B lymphocytes</scope> , leads to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this study we analyzed the effect of CD40 stimulation on the activity and nuclear appearance of Rel/nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) factors in primary murine B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show that triggering of CD40 signaling pathway(s) by CD40 ligands expressed on L cells led to strong activation of an NF-kappaB-controlled beta-globin reporter gene in primary B lymphocytes from transgenic mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analyses of nuclear translocation of individual members of Rel proteins after CD40 induction of primary B cells showed a strong and long-lasting accumulation of RelB and , less pronounced , of c-Rel .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">LPS stimulation did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> give rise to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB and c-Rel</scope> , whereas nuclear c-Rel , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> RelB</scope> , accumulated after B cell receptor stimulation .</sentence>
