<sentence id="0">Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA )</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nuclear extracts of purified PBMCs were prepared according to a technique described by Trede et al. [ 27 ] and modified for our experimental setup [ 56 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The intensity of shifted bands was normalized to bands of unstimulated controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Competition experiments with labeled and unlabeled mutated oligos of the cytokine promoter binding sites ( see above ) were carried out in order to prevent non-specific binding to nuclear proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For such experiments , an excess ( 5-50x ) of unlabeled oligos was added to the nuclear extracts .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">For specificity of binding , supershift assays for NFkappaB with a combined p65/50 antibody were performed <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">exclude</cue> non-specific reactions</scope> , a 30-fold molar excess of Oct-1 DNA ( unrelated DNA , Table 1 ) was used , which did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> compete with specific binding</scope> .</sentence>
