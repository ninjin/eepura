<sentence id="0">Spi-C , a novel Ets protein that is temporally regulated during B lymphocyte development .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A novel Ets protein was isolated by yeast one-hybrid screening of a cDNA library made from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse splenic B cells , using the SP6 kappa promoter kappaY element as a bait .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The novel Ets protein was most closely related to PU.1 and Spi-B within the DNA binding Ets domain and was therefore named Spi-C .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , Spi-C <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> represent a novel subgroup within the Ets protein family</scope> , as it differed significantly from Spi-B and PU.1 within helix 1 of the Ets domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Spi-C was encoded by a single-copy gene that was mapped to chromosome 10 , region C. Spi-C interacted with DNA similarly to PU.1 as judged by methylation interference , band-shift and site selection analysis , and activated transcription of a kappaY element reporter gene upon co-transfection of HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Spi-C RNA was expressed in mature B lymphocytes and at lower levels in macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , pre-B cell and plasma cell lines were Spi-C-negative , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that Spi-C <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be a regulatory molecule during a specific phase of B lymphoid development</scope></scope> .</sentence>
