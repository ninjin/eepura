<sentence id="6">All cell lines examined in this group also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Most B lymphocyte lines expressed negligible levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA and protein ; however ; analysis of a lymphoid/myeloid somatic hybrid <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that suppression of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in B lymphocytes <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be a dominant characteristic</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">HL-60 cells were cultured with 10(-7) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 to 72 hours , and levels of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor and its RNA were examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="neg" id="4">Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Levels of occupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor protein increased in these HL-60 cells ; but the total number of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors decreased about 50 % at 24 hours and returned toward normal at 72 hours .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="neg" id="5">Steady-state levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA were <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> affected by terminal differentiation of HL-60 toward either granulocytes or macrophages</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Nondividing macrophages from normal individuals also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In contrast , nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals did <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> express 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA</scope> ; with stimulation of proliferation of these cells , accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased markedly .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Half-life ( t1/2 ) of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in T lymphocytes was short ( 1 hour ) as determined by measuring decay of the message after addition of actinomycin D. Consistent with this short t1/2 , accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased in cells as their protein synthesis was inhibited .</sentence>
