<sentence id="0">Inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 mRNA accumulation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells treated with sodium salicylate .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lipopolysaccharide is one of the most potent trigger substances for monocytes and macrophages causing secretion of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The nature of the nuclear factors involved in regulation of these cytokine genes is still unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ; heterodimer of p50 and p65 ) proteins have been <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> to play an important role in gene transcription of inflammatory mediators when monocytes are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as salicylates have been used to treat symptoms of inflammation , and a new mechanism of drug action was suggested recently .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Salicylates have been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced gene transcription via inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of NF-kappa B inhibitor " I kappa B " , blocking the translocation of NF-kappa B into the nuclear compartment .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , <scope type="neg" id="1">the nature of the subunit involved in this mechanism has <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> been defined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To examine the mechanisms by which salicylates affect cytokine gene transcription , the amount of active and inactive NF-kappa B and NF-kappa B mRNA , in Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells was assessed .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">High doses of sodium salicylate suppressed NF-kappa B p65 mRNA accumulation , resulting in suppression of total NF-kappa B , p50 on tissue oligonucleotide had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappa B activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The data demonstrate that the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B is inhibited by salicylate treatment and highlight the role of salicylate in the control of gene expression of inflammatory mediators .</sentence>
