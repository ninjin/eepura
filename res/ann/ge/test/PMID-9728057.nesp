<sentence id="0">Interleukin-6 production in hemorrhagic shock is accompanied by neutrophil recruitment and lung injury .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hemorrhagic shock ( HS ) initiates an inflammatory cascade that includes the production of cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils ( PMN ) and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> progress to organ <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failure</cue></scope> , inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To examine the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesis</cue> that interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) contributes to PMN infiltration and lung damage in HS</scope> , we examined the lungs of rats subjected to unresuscitated and resuscitated HS for the production of IL-6 and activation of Stat3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using semiquantitative RT-PCR , we found a striking increase in IL-6 mRNA levels only in resuscitated HS , with peak levels observed 1 h after initiation of resuscitation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Increased IL-6 protein expression was localized to bronchial and alveolar cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of protein extracts from shock lungs exhibited an increase in Stat3 activation with kinetics similar to IL-6 mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In situ DNA binding assay determined Stat3 activation predominantly within alveoli .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Intratracheal instillation of IL-6 alone into normal rats resulted in PMN infiltration into lung interstitium and alveoli , marked elevation of bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity , and increased wet-to-dry ratio .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> IL-6 production and Stat3 activation occur early in HS</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> contribute to PMN-mediated lung injury , including ARDS after HS</scope> .</sentence>
