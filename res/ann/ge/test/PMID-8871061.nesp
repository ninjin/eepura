<sentence id="0">Molecular mechanisms of steroid action : a novel type of cross-talk between glucocorticoids and NF-kappa B transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of diseases characterized by inflammation , the molecular mechanism(s) by which these hormones exert this beneficial effect in patients with asthma remains to be elucidated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , we have studied the transcriptional regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) as <scope type="spec" id="0"> adhesion molecules are <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> to play a causal role in inflammation in promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We observed that in a monocytic ( U937 ) and a bronchial epithelial ( H292 ) cell-line dexamethasone strongly suppressed basal and induced ICAM-1 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">Subsequent</cue> analysis of the human ICAM-1 promoter</scope> has revealed that both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) upregulate ICAM-1 expression through the presence of a nuclear factor ( NF-kappa B ) target sequence ( TGGAAATTCC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">No</cue> glucocorticoid recognition sequences</scope> are present in this promoter region and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the multimerized NF-kappa B sequence is transactivated by TNF-alpha upon transfection in 293 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that direct interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and nuclear factor-kappa B factors is at least a partial explanation for the effects of this hormone in inflammatory diseases</scope> .</sentence>
