<sentence id="0">Numerous cytokines , both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory , have been detected in the ST of RA , and the balance between these opposing cytokine activities regulates disease severity [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Endogenous IL-10 , produced mainly by macrophages and T cells , inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production by ST cells [ 12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> this regulatory activity <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> to be restricted during chronic inflammation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The activation of both the extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase and p38 kinase pathways , induced by TNF-alpha and IL-1 , inhibits the Jak1-STAT3 signaling pathway shared by IL-10 and IL-6 in adhered macrophages [ 13 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">More importantly , IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation is mostly undetectable in RA synovial macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This impaired IL-10 signaling is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">probably</cue> induced by chronic exposure to immune complexes in vivo</scope> , because both cell surface IL-10R1 expression and IL-10-induced Jak1 activation are suppressed in IFN-gamma-primed macrophages by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway following ligation of the IgG Fc gamma receptor [ 14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , dendritic cells from RA synovial fluids are resistant to the immunoregulatory effect of IL-10 due to decreased transport of intracellular IL-10R1 in the presence of proinflammatory cytokine stimuli such as TNF-alpha , IL-1 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [ 15 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We have demonstrated that <scope type="spec" id="3"> the resistance of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10 <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be associated with defective IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> with IL-10R1 expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Inhibitory effects of IL-10 on these inflammatory cell types are therefore differentially modulated at the signal transduction level under the inflammatory environment in RA .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In association with impaired IL-10-mediated STAT3 activation , STAT3 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated persistently ( up to 6 hours ) in freshly isolated PB and ST CD4+ T cells from RA patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">STAT3 is activated by a variety of cytokines , notably the IL-6 family of cytokines ( e.g. IL-6 , IL-11 , leukemia inhibitory factor , and oncostatin M ) and growth factors , in addition to IL-10 [ 4 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Of these cytokines , IL-6 plays a predominant role in eliciting a systemic reaction such as the acute phase response in active RA , due mainly to its abundance in the blood circulation [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Consistent with this notion , IL-6 was the major STAT3-activating factor contained in the serum of active RA patients , and the responsiveness to IL-10 was suppressed in normal CD4+ T cells after 36 hours of incubation with IL-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="5"> both the sustained STAT3 activation and the resistance to IL-10 inhibition found in RA CD4+ T cells <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be induced after chronic exposure in vivo to high concentrations of serum IL-6</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">However , it is also <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">possible</cue> that STAT3 activity could be constitutively induced in CD4+ T cells by their own IL-10 secretion , leading to the loss of sensitivity to exogenous IL-10</scope> , because RA CD4+ T cells in the ST are capable of producing significant levels of IL-10 [ 34 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">CD4+ T cells isolated from the ST of RA also showed a defect in the IL-10-induced STAT3 signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">It is most <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">probable</cue> that the resistance of CD4+ T cells to IL-10 can be even augmented after migration into the inflamed ST</scope> , because IL-6 is highly concentrated compared with the blood level [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In addition , <scope type="spec" id="9"> the involvement of other essential proinflammatory cytokines in this process was <cue type="spec" id="9">suggested</cue> by our preliminary experiments demonstrating that IL-10-mediated IFN-gamma inhibition in CD4+ T cells was reduced by pretreatment with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha</scope> , although less effectively than by IL-6 <scope type="neg" id="8">( data <cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Furthermore , IFN-gamma and IL-10 produced by CD4+ T cells themselves could be responsible for impaired IL-10 signaling in the ST , because T-cell infiltrates produce both cytokines [ 34,35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">In an autocrine fashion , IL-10 <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">may</cue> persistently stimulate STAT3 activation and IFN-gamma can induce SOCS1 protein as a crosstalk inhibitor of IL-10 signaling [ 32 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20"><scope type="spec" id="11"> The T-cell-inhibitory effect of IL-10 <cue type="spec" id="11">may</cue> therefore be modulated complicatedly upon exposure to an inflammatory environment in RA joints , where many cytokines are present substantially [ 10 ]</scope> .</sentence>
