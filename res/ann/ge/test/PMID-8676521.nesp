<sentence id="0">Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 and latent membrane protein independently transactivate p53 through induction of NF-kappaB activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">B-cell immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is dependent on permanent control of the cellular processes which normally regulate cell division and apoptosis , functions possessed by p53 in a number of normal cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In studies initiated to evaluate relationships between EBV latent genes and p53 , p53 levels were found to increase approximately 10-fold 4 to 5 days after EBV infection of purified resting human B cells ; the induced p53 was transcriptionally active .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Latent membrane protein 1 and , to a lesser extent , EBV nuclear antigen 2 mediated the increase in p53 levels via activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor .</sentence>
