<sentence id="0">C/EBP proteins activate transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in macrophages/monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Three binding sites for C/EBP proteins are found in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ( V.M. Tesmer , A.Rajadhyaksha , J.Babin , and M.Bina , Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci . USA 90:7298-7302 , 1993 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have determined the functional role of C/EBP proteins and C/EBP sites in regulating transcription from the HIV- 1 LTR in monocytes/macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Inhibition of endogenous C/EBP proteins , using either an excess of C/EBP binding sites or a trans- dominant negative inhibitor , demonstrated that C/EBP proteins are required for basal and activated levels of HIV-1 LTR transcription in the promonocytic cell line U937 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Northern ( RNA ) blots and binding assays showed that NF-IL6 is the only known C/EBP family member which is increased when U937 cells are activated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutational analyses of the HIV-1 LTR showed that one C/EBP site is required for normal LTR transcription both before and after cellular activation and that the two 3' C/EBP sites are functionally equivalent .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , transcription from crippled HIV-1 LTRs lacking C/EBP sites can still be induced following activation of U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Several models are <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> for how elevated NF-IL6 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> participate in an autostimulatory loop involving HIV infection , macrophage activation , cytokine expression , and HIV replication</scope></scope> .</sentence>
