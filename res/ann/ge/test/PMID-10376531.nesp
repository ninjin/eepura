<sentence id="0">Expression and role of PML gene in normal adult hematopoiesis : functional interaction between PML and Rb proteins in erythropoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The expression of the PML gene was investigated in purified early hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) induced to unilineage erythroid or granulocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PML mRNA and protein , while barely detectable in quiescent HPCs , are consistently induced by growth factor stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thereafter , PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation , whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In functional studies , PML expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting PML mRNA ( alpha-PML ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , early treatment ( day 0 HPCs ) with alpha-PML reduced the number of both erythroid and granulocytic colonies , whereas late treatment ( day 5 culture ) reduced erythroid , but not granulocytic , clonogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that PML is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> granulocytic maturation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The pattern of PML expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of retinoblastoma pRb 105 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Combined treatment of HPCs with alpha-PML and alpha-Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , PML and pRb 105 were co-immunoprecipitated in cellular lysates derived from erythroid precursors <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> this functional interaction <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> have a biochemical basis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> a key functional role of PML in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis : the latter phenomenon <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be related to the molecular and functional interaction of PML with pRb 105</scope></scope> .</sentence>
