<sentence id="1">In this report , we show that Sox6 is a novel factor in the complicated regulation mechanism of globin genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the Sox6 null mouse , there is a transient effect on the embryonic globin genes , zeta and betaH1 , and a persistent upregulation of the epsilony globin gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Sox6 directly regulates and binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony gene and represses the epsilony-globin gene in definitive erythropoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sox6 belongs to group D of the Sox family of proteins that includes Sox5 , 12 , 13 , and 23 [ 34 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Group D Sox proteins contain a coiled-coiled domain that mediates homo- and heterodimerization [ 6,35 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Functionally , dimerization of Sox5 and Sox6 has been shown to greatly increase the binding efficiency of the two Sox proteins to DNA that contains adjacent Sox sites [ 6 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , Sox6 binds more strongly to an HMG-box dimer motif than to a single HMG-box motif [ 5 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , it <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> that target genes for group D Sox proteins , such as Sox6 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">probably</cue> harbor pairs of HMG binding sites with a configuration compatible with binding of D-Sox protein dimers</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Indeed , in the present study , the defined Sox6 target sequence of the epsilony promoter contains two Sox/Sox6 consensus sites ( Figure 3A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Functionally , both sites are essential for Sox6 binding to the epsilony promoter and repression of its activity ( Figure 3E and 3F ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These observations <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that Sox6 binds to this sequence of the epsilony promoter either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other Sox proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Because Sox proteins recognize a short 6-bp core-binding sequence that allows for considerable degeneracy , <scope type="spec" id="3"> the specificity of their actions is <cue type="spec" id="3">thought</cue> to rely upon interactions with other transcription factors [ 36 ]</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="17">Sox proteins bind and bend linear DNA by partial intercalation in the minor groove , and can also bind to four-way junctions [ 2-4 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Therefore , one attractive model to explain how Sox6 proteins control gene expression is that they function as architectural factors bound to DNA , influencing local chromatin structure by bending DNA and by assembling multiprotein transcriptional complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">By changing the local chromatin structure , Sox6 could either interfere with binding of other activators to the promoter or facilitate binding of other repressors .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Another example of a repressor that interferes with an activator on the epsilony promoter is DRED .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">DRED interferes with EKLF , an activator , in binding to the epsilony promoter [ 39 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">Two HMG architectural proteins ( distantly related to the Sox family of transcription factors ) , HMG-I and HMG-Y , were demonstrated to bind to the human adult beta globin silencers ( silencers I and II ) and cause bending of the DNA , facilitating the binding of other repressors [ 40 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive ( but <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> primitive ) erythropoiesis ( Figure 6 ) , and Sox6 represses epsilony globin expression both in vivo ( Figure 1 ) and in vitro ( Figure 2 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">Moreover , in situ hybridization clearly shows that the persistent expression of epsilony globin in p100H mutant mice is due to defects in the silencing mechanism of definitive erythropoiesis that takes place in the liver ( Figure 5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">Taken together , these data demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis to silence epsilony globin expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">The expression level of epsilony globin in homozygous Sox6 null mice at 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc is statistically equivalent to the level of betamaj/min expression in the livers of 15.5-dpc and 18.5-dpc homozygous WT mice ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">This demonstrates that ectopic expression of the epsilony globin gene is quite robust in homozygous mutant mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">The expression levels of two other embryonic globin genes ( zeta and betah1 ) are also higher in p100H homozygotes , compared with WT .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">Like epsilony , levels of zeta and betah1 are dramatically higher in mutant mice at 15.5 dpc .</sentence>
<sentence id="30">However , unlike epsilony globin , zeta and betah1 decline in expression by day 18.5 dpc ( Figure 1 ) , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggesting</cue> that epsilony is regulated differently than zeta and betah1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="31">It is <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">possible</cue> that Sox6 has a general effect on embryonic globin genes ( and erythrocyte maturation ) in addition to a specific role in silencing epsilony</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="35">At this point in development , the levels of zeta and betah1 RNA were undetectable both in mutant and WT ; however , adult beta-like globin RNA levels were moderately elevated in the mutant RNA compared with WT ( unpublished data ) , similar to what we observe at 18.5 dpc ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="36">These findings <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">suggest</cue> that Sox6 continues to function postnatally to silence epsilony globin expression and has a unique function in the regulation of epsilony-globin</scope> .</sentence>
