<sentence id="0">Comparison of retinoic acid and phorbol myristate acetate as inducers of monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several human myeloid leukemia cell lines growing in vitro can be induced to differentiate to more mature monocyte/macrophage-like cells by treatment with protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters , such as PMA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition to PMA , cells of the THP-1 myeloid leukemia cell line acquire macrophage-like characteristics after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To analyze the signal transduction mechanisms induced by RA , we first compared the effects of PMA and RA on the expression of genes which are known to be regulated during monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both RA and PMA effectively down-regulated c-myc expression , while c-myb expression decreased only after PMA treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expression of the beta 2-integrin genes , CD11a and CD11b , was clearly increased after both of these treatments .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Their effects on the src-family tyrosine kinase genes were different : hck expression was similarly induced by these agents but lyn expression was stronger and more rapid after RA treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RA also enhanced lyn mRNA production rapidly in HL-60 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the activation of lyn gene expression is common in monocytic and granulocytic maturation of myeloid leukemia cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">To examine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the AP-1 enhancer activity is involved in RA-induced monocytic differentiation</scope> , THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)-reporter gene containing 5 copies of the AP-1 binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In contrast to PMA , RA did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> induce any CAT activity in these cells</scope> , thus <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that the RA-induced changes in the expression of those genes described above were <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> dependent on the AP-1 enhancer activity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
