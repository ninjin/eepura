<sentence id="0">UV-induced CYP1A1 gene expression in human cells is mediated by tryptophan .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Induction of cytochrome P-4501A1 ( CYP1A1 ) activity by UV has been observed earlier in animal studies via a mechanism that has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> yet been resolved</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Our previous data have <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> formylated indolocarbazoles which are formed by UV irradiation of tryptophan solutions are very potent Ah-receptor agonists</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To evaluate the effect of UV light on cytochrome P4501A1 gene expression , we studied the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA by UV irradiation of cultured human keratinocytes ( HaCaT cell line ) , primary human blood lymphocytes and mouse Hepa-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The cells were exposed to UV light delivered by a bank of 6 Philips TL20/12RS sun lamps emitting primarily in the UVB range in the absence and presence of tryptophan .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) was used for analysis of gene expression in the treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results show that the CYP1A1 mRNA level induced by UV in the presence of tryptophan was higher than that induced by UV alone in both HaCaT cells and lymphocytes after 3 h of incubation post-UV irradiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To find out if the induction by UV light is caused by the formation of an Ah receptor ligand , Hepa-1 wild-type and Ah receptor deficient c12 cell lines were applied .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Wild-type ( wt ) cells were inducible <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">either</cue> by the tryptophan photoproduct 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole ( FICZ ) or by UV-irradiation but very low or undetectable levels were observed in the c12 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This shows that the induction of gene expression by FICZ and UV is Ah receptor dependent .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Together , these results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> UV-induced CYP1A1 gene expression in mammalian cells is mediated by an Ah receptor ligand formed from tryptophan</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="4"> the photoproducts of tryptophan are <cue type="spec" id="4">suggested</cue> to be mediators of light via binding to the Ah receptor and as such also <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> have a role in light-regulated biological rhythms</scope></scope> .</sentence>
