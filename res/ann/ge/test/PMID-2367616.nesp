<sentence id="0">Mononuclear leukocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding characteristics and down-regulation in major depression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Some patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and show failure to suppress cortisol secretion upon administration of dexamethasone ( DEX ) , yet they do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> have Cushingoid features</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">To</cue> study <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> this represents glucocorticoid ( GC ) resistance</scope> , [3H]-DEX-binding assays were used to measure</scope> , in vitro , the GC receptor affinity ( 1/Kd ) and number ( Bmax ) in mononuclear leukocytes of 11 MDD patients and 15 control subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">No</cue> receptor abnormalities were detected in the MDD group</scope> ; thus any cellular defect leading to a <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">lack</cue> of responsiveness to GC in the MDD patients</scope> , if present , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">probably</cue> lies beyond the initial receptor binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DEX ( 1.0 mg orally ) was administered to study in vivo GC receptor down-regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Compared to the control group , fewer depressed subjects down-regulated Bmax after DEX .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By paired t-test , Bmax decreased significantly in the control group but <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> in the depressed group</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Receptor number on the control day did <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> correlate significantly with the degree of receptor down-regulation , severity of depression or cortisol concentrations across all the subjects</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results do <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> lend support to previous reports <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggesting</cue> that GC resistance in MDD results from a GC receptor-binding abnormality</scope></scope> , and they emphasize the importance of considering receptor studies in the context of GC-mediated cell processes in order to identify the exact cellular defect(s) leading to GC resistance .</sentence>
