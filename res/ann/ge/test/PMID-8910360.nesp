<sentence id="0">Characterization of a CD43/leukosialin-mediated pathway for inducing apoptosis in human T-lymphoblastoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) J393 induces apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis identified the 140-kDa surface antigen for mAb J393 as CD43/leukosialin , the major sialoglycoprotein of leukocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While Jurkat cells co-expressed two discrete cell-surface isoforms of CD43 , recognized by mAb J393 and mAb G10-2 , respectively , only J393/CD43 signaled apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">J393/CD43 was found to be hyposialylated , bearing predominantly O-linked monosaccharide glycans , whereas G10-2/CD43 bore complex sialylated tetra- and hexasaccharide chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment with soluble , bivalent mAb J393 killed 25-50 % of the cell population , while concomitant engagement of either the CD3.TcR complex or the integrins CD18 and CD29 significantly potentiated this effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates that underwent hyperphosphorylation upon antigen receptor costimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Tyrosine kinase inhibition by herbimycin A diminished J393/CD43-mediated apoptosis , whereas inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity by bis(maltolato)oxovanadium-IV enhanced cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Signal transduction through tyrosine kinase activation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> lead to altered gene expression</scope> , as J393/CD43 ligation prompted decreases in the nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulatory protein NF-kappaB and proteins binding the interferon-inducible regulatory element .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Since peripheral blood T-lymphocytes express cryptic epitopes for mAb J393 , these findings demonstrate the existence of a tightly regulated CD43-mediated pathway for inducing apoptosis in human T-cell lineages .</sentence>
