<sentence id="1">PROBLEM : The mechanisms of the immunosuppressive and immunosuppression-inducing capacities of Jeg-3 human choriocarcinoma cell line supernatants ( HCSs ) are not yet completely understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The influence on interleukin (IL)-2 , IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production ; IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha- , beta- , and gamma-chain ; and the signaling pathway molecules Janus kinase (Jak)1 , Jak3 , signal transducers and activators of <scope type="spec" id="0"> transcription (Stat)1 , Stat3 , and Stat5 <cue type="spec" id="0">should</cue> be investigated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHOD OF STUDY : For assessment of IL production , whole peripheral venous blood from healthy donors was stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate and ionomycine .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Secretion of ILs was blocked with monensine .</sentence>
