<sentence id="0">Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin 's disease derives from post-germinal center B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human immunodeficiency virus-associated Hodgkin 's disease ( HIV-HD ) displays several peculiarities when compared with HD of the general population .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These include overrepresentation of clinically aggressive histologic types and frequent infection of Reed-Sternberg ( RS ) cells by Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , we have reported that <scope type="spec" id="0"> the histogenesis of HD of the general population <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of BCL-6 , a transcription factor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B cells , and of CD138/syndecan-1 ( syn-1 ) , a proteoglycan associated with post-GC , terminal B-cell differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we have applied these two markers to the study of HIV-HD histogenesis and correlated their expression status to the virologic features of this disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have found that RS cells of all histologic categories of HIV-HD consistently display the BCL-6(-)/syn-1(+) phenotype and thus reflect post-GC B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although BCL-6(-)/syn-1(+)RS cells of HIV-HD express CD40 , <scope type="neg" id="1">they are <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> surrounded by CD40 ligand-positive ( CD40L+ ) reactive T lymphocytes</scope> , which , in HD of the general population , are <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">thought</cue> to regulate the disease phenotype through CD40/CD40L interactions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Conversely , RS cells of virtually all HIV-HD express the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) , which , being functionally homologous to CD40 , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> contribute , at least in part , to the modulation of the HIV-HD phenotype</scope> .</sentence>
