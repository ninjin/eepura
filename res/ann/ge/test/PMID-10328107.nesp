<sentence id="0">Apoptosis and growth inhibition in malignant lymphocytes after treatment with arsenic trioxide at clinically achievable concentrations [ see comments ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Arsenic trioxide ( As2O3 ) can induce clinical remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia via induction of differentiation and programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the effects of As2O3 on a panel of malignant lymphocytes to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects of As2O3 can be observed in these cells at clinically achievable concentrations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : Eight malignant lymphocytic cell lines and primary cultures of lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma cells were treated with As2O3 , with or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> dithiothreitol ( DTT ) or buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) ( an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Apoptosis was assessed by cell morphology , flow cytometry , annexin V protein level , and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase labeling of DNA fragments .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Cellular proliferation was determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA and flow cytometry and by use of a mitotic arrest assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( delta psi(m) ) was measured by means of rhodamine 123 staining and flow cytometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis or immunofluorescence .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">RESULTS : Therapeutic concentrations of As2O3 ( 1-2 microM ) had dual effects on malignant lymphocytes : 1 ) inhibition of growth through adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) depletion and prolongation of cell cycle time and 2 ) induction of apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">As2O3-induced apoptosis was preceded by delta psi(m) collapse .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">DTT antagonized and BSO enhanced As2O3-induced ATP depletion , delta psi(m) collapse , and apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="neg" id="2">Caspase-3 activation , usually resulting from delta psi(m) collapse , was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> always associated with As2O3-induced apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">As2O3 induced PML ( promyelocytic leukemia ) protein degradation but did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> modulate expression of cell cycle-related proteins</scope> , including c-myc , retinoblastoma protein , cyclin-dependent kinase 4 , cyclin D1 , and p53 , or expression of differentiation-related antigens .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSIONS : Substantial growth inhibition and apoptosis <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> evidence of differentiation</scope> were induced in most malignant lymphocytic cells treated with 1-2 microM As2O3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">As2O3 <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> prove useful in the treatment of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders</scope> .</sentence>
