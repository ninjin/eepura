<sentence id="0">Interleukin-2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of stat3 in human T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An early biochemical event associated with T cell activation through the interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) is tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The exact mechanism by which IL-2 regulates transcription of different genes is presently unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report that stimulation through the IL-2R induced tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of stat3 , a newly identified member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) family of proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , stat1 proteins were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> tyrosine phosphorylated after IL-2 ligation</scope> , whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated stat1 proteins ( 91 and 84 kDa proteins ) were translocated to the nucleus following interferon-gamma treatment of HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Apart from stat3 , another cytoplasmic protein was tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently translocated to the nucleus in response to IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This protein had an <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">apparent</cue> molecular mass of 84 kDa</scope> and <scope type="neg" id="1">was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> recognized by stat3 or stat1 mAb or antisera</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Since IL-2 induced nuclear translocation of the 84 kDa protein and stat3 followed identical kinetics , p84 is a candidate for a new , yet undefined , member of the STAT family .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , we report that IL-2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of stat3 and an as yet undefined 84-kDa protein in antigen-specific human T cell lines .</sentence>
