<sentence id="0">Abnormalities of cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling in platelets from untreated patients with bipolar disorder .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Abnormalities in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation system have been recently reported in patients with bipolar disorder .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We evaluated the immunoreactivity of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( protein kinase A ) and 1 of its substrates , Rap1 , in platelets from untreated euthymic , manic , and depressed patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : Platelets were collected from 112 drug-free patients with bipolar disorder ( 52 euthymic , 29 depressed , and 31 manic ) and 62 healthy subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The levels of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Rap1 were assessed by Western blot analysis , immunostaining , and computer-assisted imaging .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">RESULTS</cue> : The immunolabeling of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was significantly different among groups ( P<.001 )</scope> , with higher values in untreated depressed and manic patients with bipolar disorder compared with untreated euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and healthy subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">No</cue> significant differences were found in the immunolabeling of the regulatory subunits ( type I and type II ) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The immunolabeling of Rap1 was significantly higher ( P<.001 ) in untreated euthymic , depressed , and manic patients than in healthy persons .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">CONCLUSIONS : Levels of Rap1 and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase are altered in the platelets of bipolar patients .</sentence>
