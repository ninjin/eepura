<sentence id="0">Binding of c-Rel to STAT5 target sequences in HTLV-I-transformed T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The type I human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV-I ) induces abnormal growth and subsequent transformation of T cells , which is associated with the development of an acute T-cell malignancy termed adult T-cell leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A characteristic of HTLV-I-transformed T cells is the constitutive nuclear expression of NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be essential for the growth of these transformed cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although NF-kappaB/Rel factors are known to induce the expression of T-cell growth factor interleukin (IL)-2 , it is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unclear</cue> how they participate in the IL-2-independent growth of HTLV-I-transformed cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we show that certain NF-kappaB/Rel members , predominantly c-Rel , interact with enhancer sequences for STAT5 , a key transcription factor mediating IL-2-induced T-cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Reporter gene assays reveal that the binding of c-Rel to the STAT5 site present in the Fc gammaR1 gene leads to potent transactivation of this enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Binding of c-Rel to the Fc gammaR1 STAT site also occurs in human peripheral blood T cells immortalized with HTLV-I in vitro and is correlated with enhanced levels of proliferation of these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results raise the possibility that NF-kappaB/Rel <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> participate in the growth control of HTLV-I-transformed T cells by regulating genes driven by both kappaB and certain STAT enhancers</scope> .</sentence>
