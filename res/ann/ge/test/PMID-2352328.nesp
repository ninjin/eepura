<sentence id="0">Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 transactivates latent membrane protein LMP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several lines of evidence are compatible with the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesis</cue> that Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA-2 ) or leader protein ( EBNA-LP ) affects expression of the EBV latent infection membrane protein LMP1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now demonstrate the following .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">( i ) Acute transfection and expression of EBNA-2 under control of simian virus 40 or Moloney murine leukemia virus promoters resulted in increased LMP1 expression in P3HR-1-infected Burkitt 's lymphoma cells and the P3HR-1 or Daudi cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">( ii ) Transfection and expression of EBNA-LP alone had <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on LMP1 expression</scope> and did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> act synergistically with EBNA-2 to affect LMP1 expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">( iii ) LMP1 expression in Daudi and P3HR-1-infected cells was controlled at the mRNA level , and EBNA-2 expression in Daudi cells increased LMP1 mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">( iv ) <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">No</cue> other EBV genes</scope> were required for EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 since cotransfection of recombinant EBNA-2 expression vectors and genomic LMP1 DNA fragments enhanced LMP1 expression in the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines BJAB , Louckes , and BL30 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">( v ) An EBNA-2-responsive element was found within the -512 to +40 LMP1 DNA since this DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was transactivated by cotransfection with an EBNA-2 expression vector .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">( vi ) The EBV type 2 EBNA-2 transactivated LMP1 as well as the EBV type 1 EBNA-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">( vii ) Two deletions within the EBNA-2 gene which rendered EBV transformation incompetent did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> transactivate LMP1</scope> , whereas a transformation-competent EBNA-2 deletion mutant did transactivate LMP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">LMP1 is a potent effector of B-lymphocyte activation and can act synergistically with EBNA-2 to induce cellular CD23 gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Thus , EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 amplifies the biological impact of EBNA-2 and underscores its central role in EBV-induced growth transformation .</sentence>
