<sentence id="0">Disruption of a GATA motif in the Duffy gene promoter abolishes erythroid gene expression in Duffy-negative individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The mRNA for the Duffy blood group antigen , the erythrocyte receptor for the Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite , has recently been cloned and shown to encode a widely expressed chemokine receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene ( DARC ) is composed of a single exon and that most Duffy-negative blacks carry a silent FY*B allele with a single T to C substitution at nucleotide -46 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This mutation impairs the promoter activity in erythroid cells by disrupting a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">With the recent characterization of the FY*A and FY*B alleles , these findings provide the molecular basis of the Duffy blood group system and an explanation for the erythroid-specific repression of the DARC gene in Duffy-negative individuals .</sentence>
