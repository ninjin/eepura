<sentence id="0">Naive ( CD45RA+ ) T lymphocytes are more sensitive to oxidative stress-induced signals than memory ( CD45RO+ ) cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) after oxidative stress has been shown to be an activation signal for T lymphocytes , e.g. , expression of IL-2 and its receptor are induced .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These ROI-induced effects can , to a large extent , be attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Now we have examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> naive and memory T lymphocytes differ in their sensitivity to ROI-mediated signals</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When CD45RA+ ( naive ) and CD45RO+ ( memory ) T lymphocytes were directly stimulated with H2O2 , NF-kappaB nuclear translocation was stronger in naive cells than in memory cells and it could be induced with lower doses .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The composition of the induced nuclear NF-kappaB ( levels of p50 and RelA proteins ) was similar in these cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The magnitude and kinetics of intracellular ROI were similar , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that there were <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> differences in ROI-forming mechanisms or antioxidative capacities</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">probable</cue> regulatory point</scope> was the cytoplasmic IkappaB inhibitor : in CD45RA+ cells , H2O2 caused a more profound depression in the levels of IkappaB alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> T cells representing different activation and/or differentiation stages <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">can</cue> be differentially responsive to ROI-mediated signals</scope></scope> .</sentence>
