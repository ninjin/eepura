<sentence id="0">Differences in phosphorylation of the IL-2R associated JAK/STAT proteins between HTLV-I(+) , IL-2-independent and IL-2-dependent cell lines and uncultured leukemic cells from patients with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To determine activation status of the IL-2R-associated ( Jak/STAT ) pathway in the HTLV-I infected cells , we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 , STAT3 , and STAT5 in several HTLV-I(+) T-cell lines and in uncultured leukemic T cells isolated from patients with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia ( ATLL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Constitutive basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and , usually , STAT3 and STAT5 was detected in all four IL-2-independent cell lines tested , but in none of the three IL-2-dependent cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Similarly , there was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> detectable basal phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5</scope> in the leukemic cells from ATLL patients ( 0/8 and 0/3 , respectively ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , stimulation with IL-2 resulted in Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in both leukemic ATLL cells and IL-2-dependent lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , expression of SHP-1 phosphatase which is a negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling , was lost in most IL-2 independent cell lines ( 3/4 ) but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in the leukemic ATLL cells ( 0/3 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Finally , the HTLV-I(+) T-cell lines ( 313 ) but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> the control</scope> , HTLV-I(-) T-cell lines were resistant to rapamycin and its novel analog RAD .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that ( 1 ) HTLV-I infection per se does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> result in a constitutive phosphorylation of the Jak3 , STAT3 , and STAT5 proteins</scope> ; ( 2 ) malignant transformation in at least some cases of ATLL does <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> require the constitutive</scope> , but <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> require IL-2-induced , activation of the IL-2R Jak/STAT pathway ; and ( 3 ) there are major differences in T-cell immortalization mechanism(s) <scope type="spec" id="6"> which <cue type="spec" id="6">appear</cue> to involve SHP-1 and target molecules for rapamycin and RAD</scope></scope> .</sentence>
