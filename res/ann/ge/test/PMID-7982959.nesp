<sentence id="0">The role of NFATp in cyclosporin A-sensitive tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF alpha ) gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells , in that it is rapidly induced <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> a requirement for protein synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Maximal induction of TNF alpha mRNA can be induced by treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores alone , via a calcineurin-dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A. We have previously identified a promoter element , kappa 3 , that is required for calcium-stimulated , cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of the TNF alpha gene in activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we demonstrate that the kappa 3 binding factor contains NFATp , a cyclosporin-sensitive DNA-binding protein required for interleukin-2 gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">NFATp binds to two sites within the kappa 3 element , and occupancy of both sites is required for TNF alpha gene induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , although the kappa 3 element has little sequence similarity to other NFATp-binding sites , <scope type="spec" id="1"> it <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to function as a cyclosporin-sensitive promoter element in T cells by virtue of its ability to bind NFATp</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The involvement of NFATp in transcriptional activation of both the interleukin-2 and TNF alpha genes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple cytokine genes , starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation</scope> .</sentence>
