<sentence id="0">Interferon-alpha induction of STATs1 , -3 DNA binding and growth arrest is independent of Lck and active mitogen-activated kinase in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Type I interferons ( IFNs ) are a family of cytokines that have antiviral and antiproliferative effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Data regarding the processes by which these cytokines transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus are becoming increasingly complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The most characterized pathway is via JAK-STAT signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Previous studies established a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> role for the Src-family kinase Lck in JAK-STAT signaling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , this study was designed to analyze the role of Lck in IFN-alpha signaling by using the Jurkat , JCam ( an Lck-defective cell line derived from Jurkat ) , and JCam/Lck ( JCam cells with Lck restored ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results show that IFN-alpha can induce MAPK activity , but only in cells containing Lck. Furthermore , STATs1 and -3 are effectively phosphorylated and activated to bind DNA in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of Lck expression in IFN-alpha-treated cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , the results demonstrate that IFN-alpha exerts an antiproliferative effect in all three cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> Lck and active MAPK do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affect IFN-alpha-induced growth arrest or induction of STAT1s1 and -3 DNA binding ability</scope></scope> .</sentence>
