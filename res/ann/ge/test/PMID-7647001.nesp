<sentence id="0">Expression of erythroid-specific genes in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia ( M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To clarify properties of the blast cells in M7 and TMD cases , we examined erythroid markers expression in blasts from six cases with M7 and seven cases with TMD in this study .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Erythroid-specific mRNAs encoding gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase were found to be expressed in blasts from most of these cases , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> majorities of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also found that mRNAs encoding GATA-1 and GATA-2 are expressed in all these cases .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that M7 blasts and TMD blasts correspond to the erythroid/megakaryocytic bipotential progenitor cells</scope> .</sentence>
