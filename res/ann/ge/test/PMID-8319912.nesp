<sentence id="0">The p65 subunit of NF-kappa B regulates I kappa B by two distinct mechanisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factor NF-kappa B ( p50/p65 ) is generally localized to the cytoplasm by its inhibitor I kappa B. Overproduced I kappa B , free from NF-kappa B , is rapidly degraded .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Overexpression of p65 increases endogenous I kappa B protein in both carcinoma and lymphoid cells by two mechanisms : protein stabilization and increased transcription of I kappa B mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast , p65 delta , a naturally occurring splice variant , fails to markedly augment I kappa B protein levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both overexpressed p65 and coexpressed p50 are cytoplasmic , whereas p65 delta is partly nuclear , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the I kappa B induced by p65 can maintain NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , p65 and I kappa B are linked in an autoregulatory loop , ensuring that NF-kappa B is held in the cytoplasm until cells are specifically induced to translocate it to the nucleus .</sentence>
