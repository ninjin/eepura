<sentence id="0">Mice deficient for the 55 kd tumor necrosis factor receptor are resistant to endotoxic shock , yet succumb to L. monocytogenes infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The multiple biological activities of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors of 55 kd ( TNFRp55 ) and 75 kd ( TNFRp75 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using gene targeting , we generated a TNFRp55-deficient mouse strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cells from TNFRp55-/-mutant mice <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> expression of TNFRp55</scope> but display normal numbers of high affinity TNFRp75 molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thymocyte development and lymphocyte populations are unaltered , and clonal deletion of <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> self-reactive T cells</scope> is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> impaired</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , TNF signaling is largely abolished , as judged by the failure of TNF to induce NF-kappa B in T lymphocytes from TNFRp55-deficient mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The loss of TNFRp55 function renders mice resistant to lethal dosages of either lipopolysaccharides or S. aureus enterotoxin B. In contrast , TNFRp55-deficient mice are severely impaired to clear L. monocytogenes and readily succumb to infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , the 55 kd TNFR plays a decisive role in the host 's defense against microorganisms and their pathogenic factors .</sentence>
