<sentence id="1">Human T cell lymphotropic virus I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis ( also termed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HTLV-I-infected peripheral blood T cells exhibit an initial phase of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent growth ; over time , by an <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> mechanism</scope> , the cells become IL-2-independent .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Whereas the Jak kinases Jak1 and Jak3 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins Stat3 and Stat5 are activated in normal T cells in response to IL-2 , this signaling pathway was constitutively activated in HTLV-I-transformed cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In HTLV-I-infected cord blood lymphocytes , the transition from IL-2-dependent to IL-2-independent growth correlated with the acquisition of a constitutively activated Jak-STAT pathway , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that this pathway participates in HTLV-I-mediated T cell transformation</scope> .</sentence>
