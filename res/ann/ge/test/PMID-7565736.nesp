<sentence id="0">PU.1 ( Spi-1 ) and C/EBP alpha regulate expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor alpha gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Growth factor receptors play an important role in hematopoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of hematopoiesis , we initiated a study investigating the transcription factors activating the expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) receptor alpha gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we demonstrate that the human GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion in myelomonocytic cells , which correlates with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse transcription PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter contains an important functional site between positions -53 and -41 as identified by deletion analysis of reporter constructs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that the myeloid and B cell transcription factor PU.1 binds specifically to this site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we demonstrate that a CCAAT site located upstream of the PU.1 site between positions -70 and -54 is involved in positive-negative regulation of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">C/EBP alpha is the major CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ( C/EBP ) form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Point mutations of either the PU.1 site or the C/EBP site that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter activity in myelomonocytic cells only .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , we demonstrate that in myeloid and B cell extracts , PU.1 forms a novel , specific , more slowly migrating complex ( PU-SF ) when binding the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter PU.1 site .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with PU.1 on a myeloid PU.1 binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to B cell enhancer sites and can be formed by addition of PU.1 to extracts from certain nonmyeloid cell types which do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> express PU.1</scope> , including T cells and epithelial cells , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> from erythroid cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Furthermore , we demonstrate that the PU-SF complex binds to PU.1 sites found on a number of myeloid promoters , and its formation requires an intact PU.1 site adjacent to a single-stranded region .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Expression of PU.1 in nonmyeloid cells can activate the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Deletion of the amino-terminal region of PU.1 results in a failure to form the PU-SF complex and in a concomitant loss of transactivation , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that formation of the PU-SF complex is of functional importance for the activity of the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Finally , we demonstrate that C/EBP alpha can also active the GM-CSF receptor alpha promoter in nonmyeloid cells .</sentence>
