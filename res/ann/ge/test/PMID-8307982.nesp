<sentence id="4">We studied the ability of N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamyl-m-diaminopimelyl-D-alanine ( G(Anh)MTetra ) , a naturally occurring breakdown product of peptidoglycan that is produced by soluble lytic transglycosylase of Escherichia coli , to induce cytokine expression in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">G(Anh)MTetra was found to strongly induce interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression after 2 h and IL-1 beta and IL-6 protein secretion after 48 h of activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The increase in mRNA accumulation was at least partly due to an increase in the transcription rates of the respective genes and was accompanied by a strong induction of nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1 transcription factor expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Experiments using inhibitors of protein kinase C , protein kinase A , and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways revealed that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression involves activation of an H7-inhibitable pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , it was shown that G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-6 mRNA expression depends on the synthesis of new protein , whereas G(Anh)MTetra-induced IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">When responses to G(Anh)MTetra were compared with those to LPS and muramyldipeptide ( MDP ) , it was found that the optimal response to G(Anh)MTetra induction was similar to that of LPS but significantly higher than the response to MDP .</sentence>
