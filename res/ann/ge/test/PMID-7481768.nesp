<sentence id="1">Males with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) have defects in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain ( gamma c ) gene that encodes a shared , essential component of the receptors of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-4 , IL-7 , IL-9 , and IL-15 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Janus family tyrosine kinase Jak3 is the only signaling molecule known to be associated with gamma c , so it was <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that defects in Jak3 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> cause an XSCID-like phenotype</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A girl with immunological features indistinguishable from those of XSCID was therefore selected for analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell line derived from her lymphocytes had normal gamma c expression but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacked</cue> Jak3 protein</scope> and had greatly diminished Jak3 messenger RNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sequencing revealed a different mutation on each allele : a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a frame shift and premature termination in the Jak3 JH4 domain and a nonsense mutation in the Jak3 JH2 domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The lack of Jak3 expression correlated with impaired B cell signaling , as demonstrated by the inability of IL-4 to activate Stat6 in the EBV-transformed cell line from the patient .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> the functions of gamma c are dependent on Jak3 and that Jak3 is essential for lymphoid development and signaling</scope> .</sentence>
