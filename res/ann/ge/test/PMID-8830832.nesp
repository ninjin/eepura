<sentence id="0">Cytomegalovirus modulates interleukin-6 gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Complications after lung transplantation include the development of rejection and an increased incidence of infection , particularly with cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several recent studies have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that interleukin (IL)-6 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be used to detect both infection and rejection after lung transplantation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , IL-6 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> play a role in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Because CMV is also associated with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation , we determined <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> CMV induces IL-6 gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrated that CMV infection increased both IL-6 protein and mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also demonstrated that the CMV immediate early 1 gene product increased expression of the IL-6 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This effect of the CMV immediate early 1 gene product was dependent upon the presence of specific transcription factor binding sites in the IL-6 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These studies demonstrate that CMV <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be an important cofactor in the development of rejection and infection after transplantation through its effects on IL-6</scope> .</sentence>
