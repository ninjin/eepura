<sentence id="0">Glucocorticoids promote nonphlogistic phagocytosis of apoptotic leukocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Phagocyte recognition , uptake , and nonphlogistic degradation of neutrophils and other leukocytes undergoing apoptosis promote the resolution of inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This study assessed the effects of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids on this leukocyte clearance mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pretreatment of " semimature " 5-day human monocyte-derived macrophages ( M phi ) for 24 h with methylprednisolone , dexamethasone , and hydrocortisone , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> the nonglucocorticoid steroids aldosterone , estradiol , and progesterone</scope> , potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These effects were specific in that the potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils was completely blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 , and glucocorticoids did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> promote 5-day M phi ingestion of opsonized erythrocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Similar glucocorticoid-mediated potentiation was observed with 5-day M phi uptake of alternative apoptotic " targets " ( eosinophils and Jurkat T cells ) and in uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by alternative phagocytes ( human glomerular mesangial cells and murine M phi elicited into the peritoneum or derived from bone marrow ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Importantly , methylprednisolone-mediated enhancement of the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> trigger the release of the chemokines IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , longer-term potentiation by methylprednisolone was observed in maturing human monocyte-derived M phi , with greater increases in 5-day M phi uptake of apoptotic cells being observed the earlier glucocorticoids were added during monocyte maturation into M phi .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that potentiation of nonphlogistic clearance of apoptotic leukocytes by phagocytes is a hitherto unrecognized property of glucocorticoids that has potential implications for therapies aimed at promoting the resolution of inflammatory diseases .</sentence>
