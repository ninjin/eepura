<sentence id="0">Thyroid hormone receptors form distinct nuclear protein-dependent and independent complexes with a thyroid hormone response element .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have examined the binding of nuclear proteins and recombinant thyroid hormone receptors ( TRs ) to the palindromic thyroid hormone responsive element AGGTCATGACCT ( TREp ) using a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Four specific protein-DNA complexes were detected after incubation of nuclear extracts ( NE ) from T3-responsive pituitary ( GH3 ) cells with a TREp-containing DNA fragment .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This was compared with the TREp binding of reticulocyte lysate-synthesized TRs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TR alpha 1 and TR beta 2 each formed a single major TR:TREp complex which comigrated with the least retarded complex formed by GH3 NE , while TR beta 1 formed multiple complexes <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that it can bind to TREp as an oligomer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , coincubation of 35S-TR alpha 1 , GH3 NE , and unlabeled TREp resulted in <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> only the 35S-TR:TREp complex</scope> , but in two additional more greatly retarded complexes containing 35S-TR alpha 1 and comigrating with those formed by GH3 extract alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Incubation of each of the TRs with NE from COS-7 cells , which do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> possess sufficient endogenous TRs to mediate T3-responses</scope> , resulted in formation of a new , more greatly shifted complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A similar , heat labile activity which altered mobility of the TR:TRE complex was also present in NE from T3-unresponsive JEG-3 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">At high concentration of NE , all of the TR bound to TREp was more greatly retarded than in the absence of NE .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Truncation of TR alpha 1 at amino acid 210 prevented additional complex formation in the presence of NE <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> affecting DNA binding</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that the carboxyl-terminus of the TRs is essential for interaction with nuclear proteins</scope> .</sentence>
