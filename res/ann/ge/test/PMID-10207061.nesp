<sentence id="0">Retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) agonist-induced activation of dominant-negative RXR-retinoic acid receptor alpha403 heterodimers is developmentally regulated during myeloid differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The multiple biologic activities of retinoic acid ( RA ) are mediated through RAR and retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) nuclear receptors that interact with specific DNA target sequences as heterodimers ( RXR-RAR ) or homodimers ( RXR-RXR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">RA receptor activation appears critical to regulating important aspects of hematopoiesis , since transducing a COOH-terminally truncated RARalpha exhibiting dominant-negative activity ( RARalpha403 ) into normal mouse bone marrow generates hematopoietic growth factor-dependent cell lines frozen at the multipotent progenitor ( EML ) or committed promyelocyte ( MPRO ) stages .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Nevertheless , relatively high , pharmacological concentrations of RA ( 1 to 10 & mgr ; M ) overcome these differentiation blocks and induce terminal granulocytic differentiation of the MPRO promyelocytes while potentiating interleukin-3 (IL-3)-induced commitment of EML cells to the granulocyte/monocyte lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , we utilized RXR- and RAR-specific agonists and antagonists to determine how RA overcomes the dominant-negative activity of the truncated RARalpha in these different myeloid developmental stages .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Unexpectedly , we observed that an RXR-specific , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> an RAR-specific , agonist induces terminal granulocytic differentiation of MPRO promyelocytes , and this differentiation is associated with activation of DNA response elements corresponding to RAR-RXR heterodimers <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> RXR-RXR homodimers</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This RXR agonist activity is blocked by RAR-specific antagonists , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> extensive cross-talk between the partners of the RXR -RARalpha403 heterodimer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , in the more immature , multipotent EML cells we observed that this RXR-specific <scope type="spec" id="3"> agonist is inactive <cue type="spec" id="3">either</cue> in potentiating IL-3-mediated commitment of EML cells to the granulocyte lineage or in transactivating RAR-RXR response elements</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">RA- triggered GALdbd-RARalpha hybrid activity in these cells <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicates that</cue> the multipotent EML cells harbor substantial nuclear hormone receptor coactivator activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor trichostatin A readily activates an RXR-RAR reporter construct in the multipotent EML cells but <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> in the committed MPRO promyelocytes</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating that</cue> differences in HDAC-containing repressor complexes in these two closely related but distinct hematopoietic lineages <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">might</cue> account for the differential activation of the RXR-RARalpha403 heterodimers that we observed at these different stages of myeloid development</scope></scope> .</sentence>
