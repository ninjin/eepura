<sentence id="0">Attenuation of gamma interferon-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in mononuclear phagocytes infected with Leishmania donovani : selective inhibition of signaling through Janus kinases and Stat1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The induction of gene transcription in response to gamma interferon is impaired in mononuclear phagocytes infected with Leishmania donovani , and the mechanisms involved are not fully understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The changes in gene expression brought about by gamma interferon are <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to involve transient increases in the activities of cellular protein tyrosine kinases , including the Janus kinases Jak1 and Jak2</scope> , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor Stat1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate the mechanisms accounting for the impaired responses to gamma interferon , a model system for examining overall changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation , activation of Jak1 and Jak2 and phosphorylation of Stat1 was developed in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated U-937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis of whole-cell lysates by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting showed that incubation with gamma interferon brought about specific increases in phosphotyrosine labeling of several proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Increased labeling of these proteins occurred to similar extents in control cells and in cells that had been infected with L. donovani for 16 h. Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1 were immunoprecipitated from control and interferon-treated cells , and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins , detected by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting was used to measured their activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1 increased markedly , in a dose-dependent manner , in U-937 cells incubated with gamma interferon .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , in cells infected with L. donovani , tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1 was markedly impaired .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This effect was dependent upon the duration of exposure to L. donovani and was maximal and complete at 16 h. Results similar to those observed with U-937 cells were also obtained with human peripheral blood monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> infection of human mononuclear phagocytes with L. donovani leads to impaired gamma interferon-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and selective effects on the Jak-Stat1 pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Unresponsiveness to gamma interferon for activation of this pathway <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> explain impaired transcriptional responses in leishmania-infected cells</scope> .</sentence>
