<sentence id="0">Acetylsalicylic acid and sodium salicylate inhibit LPS-induced NF-kappa B/c-Rel nuclear translocation , and synthesis of tissue factor ( TF ) and tumor necrosis factor alfa ( TNF-alpha ) in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have investigated the effects of acetylsalicylic acid and sodium salicylate on the LPS-induced synthesis of the pro-coagulant protein tissue factor ( TF ) and the pro-inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , as well as the prostaglandin PGE2 in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Both drugs dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced TF and TNF-alpha synthesis at the mRNA and the protein level , and reduced PGE2 production .</sentence>

<sentence id="4">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> expand the understanding of the anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs when activation of monocytes occurs</scope> .</sentence>
