<sentence id="0">Effects of diesel organic extracts on chemokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Polyaromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) associated with diesel exhaust particles ( DEPs ) are found in the atmospheric urban pollution .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Such compounds have been shown to favor IgE production , bronchial hyperresponsiveness , and airway inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Chemokines are a group of chemotactic cytokines involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">OBJECTIVE : We investigated the effect of DEP-PAHs on the release and mRNA expression of IL-8 , MCP-1 , and RANTES by PBMCs obtained from healthy subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">METHODS : Protein production in supernatants was assessed by ELISA , and mRNA expression was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : Secretion of IL-8 and RANTES increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of DEP-PAHs ( range , 0.5 ng to 50 ng/mL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">On the contrary , the release of MCP-1 was significantly inhibited , also in a dose-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Messenger RNA production coding for IL-8 , RANTES , and MCP-1 showed parallel variations to the production of the correspondent proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Effects of DEP-PAHs became significant at 7 hours and up to 48 hours time culture for MCP-1 , and up to 24 hours time culture for IL-8 and RANTES .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Moreover , supernatants from DEP-PAH-activated cells , compared with those of controls , exhibited a significantly enhanced chemotactic activity for neutrophils and eosinophils , which was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with anti-IL-8 and anti-RANTES neutralizing antibodies , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">CONCLUSION : These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the chemokine pathways are modulated by DEP-PAHs at the transcriptional level , reinforcing the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">idea</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="2"> the development of inflammatory reactions <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be affected by diesel exhaust emission</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
