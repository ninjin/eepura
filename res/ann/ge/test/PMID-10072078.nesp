<sentence id="0">Alternative polyadenylation events contribute to the induction of NF-ATc in effector T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcription factor NF-ATc is synthesized in three prominent isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These differ in the length of their C terminal peptides and mode of synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Due to a switch from the use of a 3' polyA site to a more proximal polyA site , NF-ATc expression switches from the synthesis of the two longer isoforms in naive T cells to that of short isoform A in T effector cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The relative low binding affinity of cleavage stimulation factor CstF-64 to the proximal polyA site <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> to contribute to its neglect in naive T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These alternative polyadenylation events ensure the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of NF-ATc necessary to exceed critical threshold levels of NF-ATc for gene induction in effector T cells .</sentence>
