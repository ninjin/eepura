T1005	Span 844 1215	Signaling through HLA class I molecules induced cyclin E-associated kinase activity within 4 h in quiescent endothelial cells, and appeared to mediate the inactivation of Rb. A cdk2 inhibitor, Olomoucine, as well as a dominant-negative cdk2 construct prevented HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb; in contrast, dominant-negative cdk4 and cdk6 constructs had no effect
