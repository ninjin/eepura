<sentence id="0">Expression of Th1 and Th2 type cytokines responding to HBsAg and HBxAg in chronic hepatitis B patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The cytokine pattern on viral antigen recognition is <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to exert a profound influence on the resolution of viral infections and viral clearance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This study was initiated to investigate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> a cytokine imbalance oriented toward Th2 type response plays a role in chronic hepatitis B. Cytokine profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with chronic hepatitis B were analysed by RT-PCR</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Upon HBsAg stimulation , expression of IFN-gamma , IL-2 , IL-4 , and IL-10 was detected in 41 % , 8 % , 41 % , and 50 % of the patients , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Among these cytokines , the expression of IFN-gamma was associated with high levels of serum AST/ALT .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , we <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">could not</cue> prove that Th2 type cytokines had a protective effect on hepatocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Upon HBxAg stimulation , there was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> recognizable association of cytokine patterns with AST/ALT levels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In conclusion , production of a Th1 cytokine , IFN-gamma , by HBsAg-reactive cells was associated with hepatocyte damage in chronic hepatitis B , while <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> counteracting effect of Th2 cytokines produced by those cells was observed</scope> .</sentence>
