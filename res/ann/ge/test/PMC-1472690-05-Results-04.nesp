<sentence id="0">GP modulated the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In a simplified approach , IL-1beta and IL-1RA <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> represent two sides of a coin , i.e. pro- or anti-inflammatory action</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , we applied the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio as an indicator of the degree of inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both , LPS and GP + LPS treatments resulted in generating more IL-1beta than IL-1RA at early time points , i.e. up to 24 h. Comparing LPS vs. GP + LPS , we did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> find substantial alterations over a time course of 48 h in the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio , only a - non-significant - 2.5fold higher ratio at 6 h. With respect to TSST-1 or the theoretical value of GP/TSST-1 calc</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">vs. GP + TSST-1 , we observed a pronounced anti-inflammatory action of GP , as demonstrated by an about 10-100 fold reduced ratio at 18 h and 24 h of incubation , i.e. a higher production of IL-1RA than of IL-1beta ( n = 3 ; both p < 0.05 ; Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A biological relevance of this result was <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> by a decrease of the IL-1 dependent release of IL-2 from murine EL-4 cells following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 or GP/TSST-1 calc</scope> .</sentence>
