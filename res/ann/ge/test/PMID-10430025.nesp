<sentence id="0">Monoallelic expression of Pax5 : a paradigm for the haploinsufficiency of mammalian Pax genes ?</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It is generally <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">assumed</cue> that most mammalian genes are transcribed from both alleles</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Hence , the diploid state of the genome offers the advantage that a loss-of-function mutation in one allele can be compensated for by the remaining wild-type allele of the same gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Indeed , the vast majority of human disease syndromes and engineered mutations in the mouse genome are recessive , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> recessiveness is the ' default ' state</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , a minority of genes are semi-dominant , as heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in these genes leads to phenotypic abnormalities .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This condition , known as haploinsufficiency , has been described for five of the nine mammalian Pax genes , which are associated with mouse developmental mutants and human disease syndromes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Recently we have reported that the Pax5 gene is subject to allele-specific regulation during B cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pax5 is predominantly transcribed from only one of its two alleles in early B-lymphoid progenitors and mature B cells , while it transiently switches to a biallelic mode of transcription in pre-B and immature B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">As a consequence , B-lymphoid tissues are mosaic with regard to the transcribed allele , and heterozygous mutation of Pax5 therefore results in deletion of B lymphocytes expressing only the mutant allele .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The allele-specific regulation of Pax5 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">raises the</cue> intriguing possibility that monoallelic expression <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> also be the mechanism causing the haploinsufficiency of other Pax genes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In this review , we discuss different models accounting for the haploinsufficiency of mammalian Pax genes , provide further evidence in support of the allele-specific regulation of Pax5 and discuss the implication of these findings in the context of the recent literature describing the stochastic and monoallelic activation of other hematopoietic genes .</sentence>
