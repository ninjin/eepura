<sentence id="0">Tumor necrosis factor receptor expression and signal transduction in HIV-1-infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : To examine the inter-relationship between HIV-1 infection and the cell surface receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha , an immunoregulatory cytokine that can enhance HIV-1 replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">DESIGN : Infected promyelocytic and promonocytic cells were examined because they normally express both types of TNF receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : TNF receptor surface expression was determined by specific monoclonal antibody recognition and flow cytometry , and signal transduction was detected by gel shift analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HIV-1 activation and expression was quantitated by reverse transcriptase assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RESULTS : In the OM-10.1 promyelocytic model of chronic infection , TNF-alpha-induced HIV-1 expression also resulted in a substantial increase in 75 kd TNF receptor ( TR75 ) expression although <scope type="neg" id="0">55 kD TNF receptor ( TR55 ) levels were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> dramatically altered</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A series of uninfected parental HL-60 subclones all reduced TR75 surface expression in response to TNF-alpha treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Enhanced TR75 expression on OM-10.1 cells followed the same TNF-alpha-dose dependency as that observed for HIV-1 production .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">An increase in TR75 expression was also evident during the peak of an acute HIV-1 infection of HL-60 promyelocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Although TR55 expression was unaltered during TNF-alpha-induced HIV activation , this receptor was still involved in the viral activation process .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Antibody cross-linking of TR55 , in the absence of exogenous TNF-alpha , induced maximal HIV-1 expression , an up-modulation of surface TR75 , and nuclear NF-kappa B activity in OM-10.1 cultures .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Surprisingly , this was the case even when an antagonistic anti-TR55 antibody was used .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Anti-TR55 antibody cross-linking in chronically infected U1 promonocytic cultures <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> only partially substitute for TNF-alpha-induced HIV-1 expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSIONS : Our results demonstrated that HIV-1 infection can selectively influence the surface expression of TNF receptors , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> influencing its own expression and altering normal immunoregulatory signal transduction</scope> .</sentence>
