<sentence id="0">Transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2 mediate induction of acid sphingomyelinase during monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cells from the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiate towards a macrophage-like phenotype when stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate -13- acetate ( PMA ) , 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 , and various other agents .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate here that the expression of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ; E.C.3.1.4.12 ) is induced during this process and is strongly elevated in differentiated THP-1 cells , as well as in differentiated human mononuclear phagocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using Northern blotting , RNase protection assay , and nuclear run-on analyses , we show that the up-regulation of ASM expression is regulated mainly at the level of transcription and that new protein synthesis is required for enhanced ASM activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This cell-type specific induction by PMA treatment was further investigated with respect to transcriptional control .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A series of 5' deletion derivatives of the upstream regulatory region were used in transient transfection assays to identify promoter elements required for basal and inducible gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -319 and -219 bp upstream of the initiation codon and co-transfections with transcription factor expression plasmids for AP-2 and Sp1 resulted in augmented ASM promoter activity , which was abolished when the binding sites for these two factors were deleted .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays we demonstrate that this region is specifically bound by Sp1 and AP-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These factors are present in nuclear extracts prepared from both induced and uninduced THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the intensity of the complex formed <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to increase when nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells were used</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">From these studies , we conclude that a concerted action of the transcription factors AP-2 and Sp1 is essential for the up -regulation of ASM expression during the process of macrophage differentiation .</sentence>
