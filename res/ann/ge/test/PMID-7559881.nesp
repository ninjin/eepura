<sentence id="0">Evidence for normal vitamin D receptor messenger ribonucleic acid and genotype in absorptive hypercalciuria .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Absorptive hypercalciuria ( a stone-forming condition ) is characterized by gut hyperabsorption of calcium , hypercalciuria , and reduced bone density .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Inasmuch as these features implicate enhanced calcitriol action in gut and bone , we analyzed the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene to ascertain <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> an abnormality of this gene marks patients with intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have compared the frequency of a restriction fragment length polymorphism ( Bsm I ) associated with different alleles of the VDR gene in a group of 33 well characterized absorptive hypercalciuric patients and a group of 36 normal race- and age-matched control subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">There was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> difference between the distribution of the VDR alleles in the patient population when compared with the normal population</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The coding region of VDR messenger RNA was also normal , as determined by both DNA sequence analysis and chemical mismatch cleavage analysis of copy DNA from 11 index absorptive hypercalciuric patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the basis of these results , we <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">propose</cue> that the enhanced intestinal calcium absorption invariably seen in absorptive hypercalciuria and attendant symptoms of this disorder are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> attributable to mutations of the VDR</scope> and are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> linked to a common VDR genotype</scope></scope> .</sentence>
