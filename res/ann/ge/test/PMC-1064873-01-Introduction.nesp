<sentence id="1">IL-10 is a key cytokine in regulating inflammatory responses , mainly by inhibiting the production and function of proinflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">IL-10 binds to the IL-10 receptor ( IL-10R ) complex that is composed of two subunits , the primary ligand-binding component type 1 IL-10R ( IL-10R1 ) and the accessory component type 2 IL-10R [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The interaction of IL-10 and IL-10R engages the Janus kinase ( JAK ) family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 , which are constitutively associated with IL-10R1 and type 2 IL-10R , respectively [ 2 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IL-10 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the latent transcriptional factors signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 3 and STAT1 [ 3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Upon phosphorylation , STAT1 and STAT3 proteins form homodimers or heterodimers , rapidly translocate into the nucleus , and modulate gene transcription .</sentence>

<sentence id="7">Studies of cell-type-specific STAT3-deficient mice have shown that STAT3 activation is essential for IL-10-mediated anti-inflammatory reactions in macrophages and neutrophils [ 5 ] , but is responsible for IL-6-mediated prevention of apoptosis in T cells [ 6 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS ) proteins have been identified as a family of endogenous JAK kinase inhibitors that can act in classic feedback inhibition loops , but their roles as the mediators of crosstalk inhibition by opposing cytokine signaling pathways have been clarified [ 7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Recent studies <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> SOCS3 plays a key role in regulating the divergent action of IL-10 and IL-6 , by specifically blocking STAT3 activation induced by IL-6 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> that induced by IL-10 [ 8,9 ]</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The synovial membrane of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is characterized by an infiltrate of a variety of inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells , together with proliferation of synovial fibroblast-like cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Numerous cytokines are overproduced in the inflamed joint , and macrophages and synovial fibroblasts are an important source of proinflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and IL-1 , two major macrophage products , are crucial in the process of chronic inflammation and joint destruction , and they give rise to effector components , including other inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , growth factors , matrix proteases , nitric oxide , and reactive oxygen species [ 10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine produced substantially by activated fibroblasts , and its proinflammatory actions include simulating the acute-phase response , B-cell maturation into plasma cells , T-cell functions , and hematopoietic precursor cell differentiation [ 11 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">However , anti-inflammatory cytokines and cytokine inhibitors are also present in large quantities in RA joints .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">IL-10 , produced by macrophages and partly by T cells in the synovial tissue ( ST ) , is best known as a negative regulator for macrophage and Th1 cells , but the expression level is insufficient to counterbalance the cascade of proinflammatory events [ 12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In addition , <scope type="spec" id="2"> the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to be modulated at the level of signal transduction during chronic inflammation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">IL-10 signaling is impaired in macrophages upon chronic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 and immune complexes [ 13,14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Cell surface expression of IL-10R1 is decreased in synovial fluid dendritic cells due to the presence of TNF-alpha , IL-1 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [ 15 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="19"><scope type="spec" id="3"> CD4+ T cells <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be activated by arthritogenic antigens , in conjunction with CD28-mediated costimulatory signaling , in RA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">The significance of this autoimmune process has been supported by the linkage of the MHC class II antigens HLA-DRB1*0404 and HLA-DRB1*0401 with disease susceptibility and severity [ 16,17 ] , and by the high-level expression of MHC class II molecules and both CD28 ligands , CD80 and CD86 , in the inflamed ST [ 18-20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">The continuing emergence of activated CD4+ T cells , even though few in number , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be crucial in sustaining the activation of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts through cell surface signaling by means of cell surface CD69 and CD11 , as well as the release of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN)-gamma and IL-17 [ 21,22 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">In addition , CD4+ T cells could stimulate B-cell production of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor and osteoclast-mediated bone destruction .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Their obligatory role in RA synovitis was recently proved by successful treatment of active disease by selective inhibition of T-cell activation with fusion protein of cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG , which can block the engagement of CD28 on T cells by binding to CD80 and CD86 with high avidity [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">IL-10 efficiently blocks the antigen-specific T-cell cytokine response by inhibiting the CD28 signaling pathway [ 24 ] , as well as indirectly by downregulating the function of antigen-presenting cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">To elucidate the resistance of CD4+ T cells to this direct inhibition in RA , we investigated the production of IFN-gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL-10 , the induction of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation by IL-10 , and the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA in peripheral blood ( PB ) CD4+ T cells from RA patients .</sentence>
