T1001	Span 3955 4144	The T-cell-inhibitory effect of IL-10 may therefore be modulated complicatedly upon exposure to an inflammatory environment in RA joints, where many cytokines are present substantially [10]

E1001	Speculation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 3822 3953	may persistently stimulate STAT3 activation and IFN-gamma can induce SOCS1 protein as a crosstalk inhibitor of IL-10 signaling [32]

E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005

T1006	Speculation 351 356	seems
E1003	Speculation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 326 401	this regulatory activity seems to be restricted during chronic inflammation
T1008	Speculation 1406 1409	may
E1004	Speculation:T1008 Scope:T1009
T1009	Span 1363 1504	the resistance of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10 may be associated with defective IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation, but not with IL-10R1 expression

E1006	Speculation:T1012 Scope:T1013
T1013	Span 2518 2700	both the sustained STAT3 activation and the resistance to IL-10 inhibition found in RA CD4+ T cells may be induced after chronic exposure in vivo to high concentrations of serum IL-6

T1015	Span 2505 2700	suggest that both the sustained STAT3 activation and the resistance to IL-10 inhibition found in RA CD4+ T cells may be induced after chronic exposure in vivo to high concentrations of serum IL-6

E1008	Speculation:T1016 Scope:T1017
T1017	Span 3096 3208	probable that the resistance of CD4+ T cells to IL-10 can be even augmented after migration into the inflamed ST

E1009	Speculation:T1018 Scope:T1019
T1019	Span 2722 2882	possible that STAT3 activity could be constitutively induced in CD4+ T cells by their own IL-10 secretion, leading to the loss of sensitivity to exogenous IL-10

E1010	Speculation:T1020 Scope:T1021
T1021	Span 3295 3543	the involvement of other essential proinflammatory cytokines in this process was suggested by our preliminary experiments demonstrating that IL-10-mediated IFN-gamma inhibition in CD4+ T cells was reduced by pretreatment with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha
