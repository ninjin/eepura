<sentence id="0">Single point estimation of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of normal subjects and of children under long term glucocorticoid treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A single point assay of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in human lymphocytes based on the measurement of specific dexamethasone binding has been developed and compared with a common multi-point Scatchard analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The assay conditions-concentration of the ligand 20 nmol/l , incubation time 2 h and the cell count 2-6 mil .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">cells/tube in the assay volume 0.25 ml were found to be optimal .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">An attempt was also undertaken to use a cell harvester for the separation of cells from unbound ligand .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Though specifically bound dexamethasone measured by whole-cell assay and that using cell harvester correlated well , almost by one order lower values obtained with the latter method render it non-applicable for receptor quantitation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results from 9 healthy volunteers ( average GR concentration 7131 +/- 1256 sites/cell ) correlated excellently with those obtained by the Scatchard analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The single point assay has been also applied for determination of GH in 10 children treated with large doses of prednisone .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The average values from healthy volunteers did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> differ significantly from those found in these children</scope> , though much broader range was found in patients .</sentence>
