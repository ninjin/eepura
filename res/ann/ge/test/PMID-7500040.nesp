<sentence id="0">Anti-immunoglobulin M activates nuclear calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in human B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We and others have previously shown that the nuclear protein , Ets-1 , is phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner after ligation of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) M on B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As this phosphorylation was independent of protein kinase C activity , we tested <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( CaM kinase ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> phosphorylate the Ets-1 protein after elevation of intracellular free calcium concentrations</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The dephosphorylated form of Ets-1 has been shown to bind to chromatin , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that the operative kinase <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">should</cue> be detectable in the nucleus</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We prepared nuclear extracts from two human B cell lines in which increased intracellular free calcium levels correlated with increased phosphorylation of the Ets-1 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activity of the CaM kinases was determined using a synthetic peptide substrate both in the absence and presence of an inhibitor specific for the CaM kinase family , KN-62 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Stimulation of cells with anti-IgM led to increased activity of a nuclear kinase that <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">could</cue> phosphorylate the peptide</scope> , and this activity was reduced by 10 microM KN-62 .</sentence>
