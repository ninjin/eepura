<sentence id="0">Cutting edge : expression of the NF of activated T cells in eosinophils : regulation by IL-4 and IL-5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We report that NF-AT1 and NF-AT4 are expressed cytoplasmically in resting eosinophils , whereas NF-AT2 and NF-AT3 have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been seen</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Likewise , NF-AT1 mRNA and NF-AT4 mRNA have been detected in resting eosinophils , and their levels can be significantly up-regulated by the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">There is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> detectable NF-AT protein expression in the nuclei of resting eosinophils</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However NF-ATs appear in the nuclei of IL-4- , IL-5- , or ionomycin-stimulated eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Only NF-AT1 and NF-AT4 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> NF-AT2 and NF-AT3</scope> , have translocated into the nuclei in IL-4- or IL-5-stimulated eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These findings delineate a novel pathway in the cytokine network in which Th2 lymphocytes " control " eosinophils via the release of IL-4 and IL-5 , and activation of NF-AT in eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The findings also <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that a later feedback " talking " <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> exist between eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
