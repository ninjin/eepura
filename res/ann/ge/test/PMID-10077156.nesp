<sentence id="0">Glucocorticoid hormone suppression of human neutrophil-mediated tumor cell cytostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In the present study , we have investigated the effect of glucocorticoid hormones on neutrophil-mediated tumor cell cytostasis and found that hydrocortisone and a synthetic hormone , dexamethasone ( Dex ) , inhibited cytostasis in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of tumor necrosis factor-alpha</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The effect of Dex was completely reversed by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist , RU38486 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To clarify the underlying mechanisms , we examined effects of Dex on the binding avidity of beta2 integrin on the neutrophil surface and how these <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> in turn</scope> affect neutrophil-to-tumor cell binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Dex was found to inhibit these neutrophil properties , and RU38486 completely suppressed both forms of Dex inhibition .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Taken together , our findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that glucocorticoid hormone inhibition of neutrophil-mediated tumor cell cytostasis is at least partially due to a lowering of the ligand binding avidity of beta2 integrin on the neutrophil surface</scope> .</sentence>
