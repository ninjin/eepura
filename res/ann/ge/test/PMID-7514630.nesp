<sentence id="0">Inhibition of T cell activation by the extracellular matrix protein tenascin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tenascin ( TN ) is an extracellular matrix protein that is expressed widely in the fetus and sparingly in the adult , but reappears at high levels in certain areas of tissue insult such as tumor matrices and sites of wound healing .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show here that soluble TN inhibits proliferation of human T cells in response to alpha CD3 Ab co-immobilized with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin ( FN ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TN also inhibits proliferation driven by alpha CD3/IL-2 or by phorbol ester/IL-2 , and it prevents high level induction of IL-2R .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The presence of TN in culture medium does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detectably alter the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from T cell triggering with alpha CD3</scope> , but at later time points prevents the appearance of functional NF-AT1 transcription factor complexes in T cell nuclear extracts .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These findings are consistent with the postulated role for TN as a natural antagonist to FN action , and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that T cell responses occurring at tissue sites in which TN is expressed could be influenced by its presence</scope> .</sentence>
