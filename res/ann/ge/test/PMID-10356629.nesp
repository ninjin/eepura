<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">BACKGROUND</cue> : Patients with anorexia nervosa do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> display cushingoid features in spite of elevated cortisol plasma levels</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Whether a cortisol resistance or a reduced availability of the metabolic substrates necessary to develop the effect of glucocorticoids is responsible for this has <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> been established</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : Twenty-two patients with severe restrictive anorexia nervosa , 10 patients with active Cushing 's disease , and 24 healthy volunteers <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> psychiatric disorders <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">or</cue> mood alterations</scope> were investigated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Glucocorticoid receptor characteristics were examined on mononuclear leukocytes by measuring [3H]dexamethasone binding and the effect of dexamethasone on [3H]thymidine incorporation , which represents an index of DNA synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RESULTS : The number of glucocorticoid receptors on mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) was comparable in patients with anorexia nervosa , patients with active Cushing 's disease , and normal subjects ( binding capacity 3.3 +/- 0.23 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.30 and 3.5 +/- 0.20 fmol/10(6) cells ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conversely , glucocorticoid receptor affinity was significantly decreased in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing 's patients compared to control subjects ( dissociation constant 4.0 +/- 0.31 and 4.1 +/- 0.34 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.29 nmol/L , p < .001 ) and inversely correlated with the levels of urinary free cortisol in both groups of patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Basal [3H]thymidine incorporation in MNL was significantly reduced in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing 's patients compared to control subjects ( p < .001 ) and was diminished by dexamethasone to an extent similar to control subjects in patients with anorexia nervosa , but significantly ( p < .001 ) less in those with Cushing 's disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In patients with anorexia nervosa , the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the MNL was inversely correlated with urinary free cortisol levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSIONS : These data <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicate that</cue> the <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">lack</cue> of cushingoid features in patients with anorexia nervosa</scope> is <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> ascribable to a reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids</scope> but is more <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">likely</cue> due to the paucity of metabolic substrates</scope></scope> .</sentence>
