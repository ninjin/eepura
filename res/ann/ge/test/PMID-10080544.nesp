<sentence id="0">Lineage-specific activation of STAT3 by interferon-gamma in human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Binding of interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) to its heterodimeric receptor induces activation of the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Selective activation of STAT1alpha at the IFN-gamma receptor is achieved by specific interaction between a cytosolic tyrosine motif including Y440 in the IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain and the SH2 domain of STAT1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate that , in addition to STAT1alpha , STAT3 is also activated by IFN-gamma in human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="0">The activation of STAT3 was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> found in human eosinophils , monocytes , and HL-60 cells</scope> , although the STAT3 protein was expressed in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The cell type-specific activation of STAT3 by IFN-gamma was also observed in neutrophils that are differentiated in vitro from human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> a single cytokine receptor can activate different STAT family members in a cell-specific manner , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> result in cell-specific gene transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
