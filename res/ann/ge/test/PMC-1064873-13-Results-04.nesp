<sentence id="0">IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and inhibition of IL-10 effect in normal CD4+ T cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">STAT3 is activated by many cytokines and growth factors such as the IL-6 family of cytokines ( IL-6 , IL-11 , leukemia inhibitory factor , and oncostatin M ) , platelet-derived growth factor , and epidermal growth factor , in addition to IL-10 [ 4 ] , but previous studies have demonstrated that IL-6 is the major factor in RA synovial fluid that induces constitutive activation of STAT3 in mononuclear cells [ 31 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Since IL-6 is also abundant in sera of active RA patients , frequently detected at > 1 ng/ml [ 27 ] , we examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> persistent exposure of CD4+ T cells to high concentrations of IL-6 in the blood circulation was responsible for their sustained STAT3 activation and resistance to IL-10 inhibition in active RA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was activated by IL-6 in normal CD4+ T cells <scope type="neg" id="1">( data <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> shown )</scope> , in agreement with previous observations [ 4 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Normal CD4+ T cells were thus incubated for 20 min with culture medium containing 30 % serum from active RA patients and neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody or control antibody , and STAT phosphorylation was examined by western blot analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RA serum was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> STAT1</scope> , and this STAT3 activation was mostly abolished by neutralization of IL-6 activity ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">5a ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> IL-6 is the dominant STAT3-activating factor contained in sera of active RA patients</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">lack</cue> of STAT1 activation by RA serum</scope> <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="6"> much higher concentrations of IL-6 <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be required for STAT1 activation as compared with STAT3 activation , or that inhibitors of STAT1 signaling <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be present in RA serum</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We next examined <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">whether</cue> IL-6 <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">could</cue> suppress the effect of IL-10 to inhibit IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">After preincubation with or <scope type="neg" id="10"><cue type="neg" id="10">without</cue> 10 ng/ml</scope> IL-6 for 36 hours , normal CD4+ T cells were stimulated by CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">absence</cue> of 1 ng/ml IL-10</scope> for 36 hours , and the IFN-gamma production was measured by ELISA .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">IL-6 pretreatment of normal cells reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of IFN-gamma production ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">5b ) , <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">indicating that</cue> high concentrations of IL-6 could modulate T-cell responsiveness to IL-10</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Taken together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">suggest</cue> that persistent exposure to serum IL-6 <scope type="spec" id="14"> <cue type="spec" id="14">may</cue> have a role in both the induction of STAT3 activation and the resistance to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 in RA CD4+ T cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
