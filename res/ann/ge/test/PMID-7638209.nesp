<sentence id="0">Overexpression of DR-nm23 , a protein encoded by a member of the nm23 gene family , inhibits granulocyte differentiation and induces apoptosis in 32Dc13 myeloid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chronic myelogenous leukemia evolves in two clinically distinct stages : a chronic and a blast crisis phase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The molecular changes associated with chronic phase to blast crisis transition are largely unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have identified a cDNA clone , DR-nm23 , differentially expressed in a blast-crisis cDNA library , which has approximately 70 % sequence similarity to the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> metastatic suppressor genes</scope> , nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The deduced amino acid sequence similarity to the proteins encoded by these two latter genes is approximately 65 % and includes domains and amino acid residues ( the leucine zipper-like and the RGD domain , a serine and a histidine residue in the NH2- and in the COOH-terminal portion of the protein , respectively ) postulated to be important for nm23 function .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">DR-nm23 mRNA is preferentially expressed at early stages of myeloid differentiation of highly purified CD34+ cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Its constitutive expression in the myeloid precursor 32Dc13 cell line , which is growth-factor dependent for both proliferation and differentiation , results in inhibition of granulocytic differentiation induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and causes apoptotic cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results are consistent with a role for DR-nm23 in normal hematopoiesis and raise the possibility that its overexpression contributes to differentiation arrest , a feature of blastic transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia .</sentence>
