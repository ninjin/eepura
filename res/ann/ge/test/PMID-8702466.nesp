<sentence id="0">Protein-tyrosine kinase activation is required for lipopolysaccharide induction of interleukin 1beta and NFkappaB activation , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> NFkappaB nuclear translocation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In human monocytes , interleukin 1beta protein production and steady state mRNA levels are increased in response to lipopolysaccharide , predominantly as a result of increased transcription of the interleukin 1beta gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Expression of interleukin 1beta and other cytokines , such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha , has been shown to be dependent on the activation of the transcription factor , NFkappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Since recent studies have shown that <scope type="neg" id="1">lipopolysaccharide-induced tyrosine kinase activation is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> required for NFkappaB nuclear translocation</scope> , we sought to determine <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> NFkappaB translocated in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity was active in stimulating transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have found that , in the human pro-monocytic cell line , THP-1 , the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of interleukin 1beta is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Tyrosine kinases are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> required for lipopolysaccharide-mediated nuclear translocation of NFkappaB</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity , the ability of NFkappaB to stimulate transcription is impaired .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This inhibition of transcription is specific for NFkappaB ; in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity , AP-1-dependent transcription is enhanced .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that , while lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory mediators requires tyrosine kinase activity , tyrosine kinase activity is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> obligatory for lipopolysaccharide signal transduction</scope></scope> .</sentence>
