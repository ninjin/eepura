<sentence id="0">The Persistent Expression of epsilony Globin in Sox6-Deficient Mice Is Due to a Defect in the epsilony-Gene-Silencing Mechanism in Definitive Erythroid Cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Normally , the epsilony globin gene is exclusively expressed in primitive erythrocytes and silenced in definitive erythrocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the persistent expression of epsilony globin is due to residual primitive erythrocytes <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> is due to ectopic expression of epsilony globin in definitive erythrocytes</scope></scope> , we examined the spatial pattern of epsilony globin transcripts in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization ( Figure 5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As expected , <scope type="neg" id="2">epsilony globin is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> expressed in the WT 14.5-dpc liver , the site of definitive erythropoiesis in the fetus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , abundant ectopic epsilony mRNA expression is seen in the liver of 14.5-dpc mutants ( Figure 5 A-D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the expression of betamaj/min globin is equally abundant in both WT and p100H mutant mice ( Figure 5 E and F ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data demonstrate that the persistent high levels of epsilony are due to ectopic expression in the definitive erythroid cells that mature in the fetal liver , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that there is an intrinsic defect of the epsilony silencing mechanism in Sox6-null mice</scope> .</sentence>
