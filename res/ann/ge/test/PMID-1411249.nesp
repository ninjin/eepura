<sentence id="0">A microtitre assay system for glucocorticoid receptors : decreased receptor concentration in myocardial infarction .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A major difficulty in determination of glucocorticoid receptor sites is the very complicated assay procedure .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , we describe a microtitre assay system for glucocorticoid receptors which is a whole-cell competitive binding radioassay using [3H]-dexamethasone as radioligand .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This modification of a previously described protocol simplifies and reduces laboratory work and allows assay reproducibility to be controlled more reliably .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus enabled to perform the test on multiple blood samples in parallel , we investigated cardiac infarction patients over a 12-day period to test <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">if</cue> glucocorticoid receptor binding is altered in this ' stressful ' disease</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">On the first day of the disease , glucocorticoid receptor capacity was significantly decreased <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> alteration of the receptor-ligand affinity</scope> , whereas on days 4 and 12 the number of receptor sites was normal again .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This result fits well into the general observation of stress-induced down-regulation of immune responses .</sentence>
