<sentence id="0">USF/c-Myc enhances , while Yin-Yang 1 suppresses , the promoter activity of CXCR4 , a coreceptor for HIV-1 entry .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factors USF1 and USF2 up-regulate gene expression ( i.e. , HIV-1 long terminal repeats ) via interaction with an E box on their target promoters , which is also a binding site for c-Myc .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The c-Myc oncoprotein is important in control of cellular proliferation and differentiation , while Yin-Yang 1 ( YY1 ) has been shown to control the expression of a number of cellular and viral genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These two proteins physically interact with each other and mutually inhibit their respective biological functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we show that USF/c-Myc up-regulates , while YY1 down-regulates the promoter activity of CXCR4 , a coreceptor for T cell-tropic HIV-1 entry .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have identified an E box around -260 and a YY1 binding site around -300 relative to the transcription start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutation of the E box abolished USF/c-Myc- mediated up-regulation of CXCR4 promoter activity , and mutation of the YY1 binding site was associated with unresponsiveness to YY1-mediated inhibition .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that USF/c-Myc and YY1 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play an important role in the HIV-1-replicative cycle , by modulating both the viral fusion/entry process and viral expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
