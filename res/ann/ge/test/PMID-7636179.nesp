<sentence id="0">Latent membrane protein-1 induces cyclin D2 expression , pRb hyperphosphorylation , and loss of TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition in EBV-positive B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The normal cell cycle is regulated by several molecules , such as the tumor-suppressor protein pRb , the G1 cyclins , the cyclin-dependent kinases , and their inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These regulators are targeted by negative growth regulatory signals , such as that provided by TGF-beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that the presence of either wild-type EBV or its transforming latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) results in the loss of TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition in human B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Chemical cross-linking with 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1 showed an essentially normal TGF-beta receptor profile in EBV-positive and EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines , and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals , as evidenced by the TGF-beta 1-mediated modulation of junB gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , TGF-beta 1 did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV ( or LMP-1 ) -positive cells as opposed to EBV-negative cells</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a dichotomy in the TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , LMP-1 was found to induce the expression of cyclin D2 ; normal B cells or EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> express D-type cyclins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , these data point to a <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potential</cue> mechanism underlying EBV-mediated B cell transformation whereby constitutive induction of key cell cycle regulators by LMP-1 <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">can</cue> lead to pRb hyperphosphorylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
