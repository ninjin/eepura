<sentence id="3">Binding of [3H]1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D3 ) to its receptor in these cell lines was compared to binding studies using a T-lymphocyte cell line ( S-LB1 ) from a normal individual .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor of S-LB1 was comparable to the well-characterized chick intestinal 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor in terms of its ligand binding affinity and capacity , its mobility on 5-20 % sucrose gradients , and its adsorption to and elution properties from DNA-cellulose .</sentence>

<sentence id="6">In a fourth cell line , A1-VDR , the receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 had a low binding capacity and 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase activity was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> detectable</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Induction of 24,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis by 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in the fifth cell line , designated Ro-VDR , although the sensitivity to hormone treatment was lower than in the control cell line from a normal donor .</sentence>
