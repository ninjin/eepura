<sentence id="0">Regulation of the balance of cytokine production and the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) transcription factor activity by cytokines and inflammatory synovial fluids .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The balance between type 1 and 2 T helper cell cytokine production plays an important role in several animal models of autoimmunity , and skewed patterns of cytokine expression have been described in human inflammatory diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Many cytokines activate signal transducer and activation of transcription ( STAT ) transcription factors , which , in turn , activate transcription of inflammatory effector genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We used mononuclear cell priming cultures and inflammatory synovial fluids ( SFs ) derived from arthritis patients to examine the regulation of cytokine production and STAT activity by an inflammatory synovial microenvironment .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Exposure to SFs during priming resulted in an 81 % inhibition of interferon (IFN)-gamma , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> interleukin ( IL ) 4 , production by effector cells generated in priming cultures</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">SF suppression was mediated by IL-4 and IL-10 and inhibition of IL-12 expression , and it was reversed in a dominant fashion by exogenous IL-12 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">SFs blocked the sustained activity of transcription factor Stat1 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> Stat3</scope> , during the priming period , and Stat1 activity was differentially regulated by cytokines in parallel with their positive or negative regulation of IFN-gamma production .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Active Stat3 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> Stat1</scope> , was detected in cells from inflamed joints .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a role for altered balance of Stat1 and Stat3 transcriptional activity in the regulation of T cell differentiation and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory synovitis</scope> .</sentence>
