<sentence id="0">beta-(1-->3)-D-glucan modulates DNA binding of nuclear factors kappaB , AT and IL-6 leading to an anti-inflammatory shift of the IL-1beta/IL-1 receptor antagonist ratio</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background</sentence>
<sentence id="2">beta-1-->3-D-glucans represent a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and are able to modify biological responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Employing a comprehensive methodological approach , the aim of our in vitro study was to elucidate novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of human peripheral blood immune cells mediated by a fungal beta-1-->3-D-glucan , i.e. glucan phosphate , in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 ( TSST-1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Results</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Despite an activation of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB , NFinterleukin(IL)-6 and NFAT similar to LPS or TSST-1 , we observed no significant production of IL-1beta , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma induced by glucan phosphate .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Glucan phosphate-treated leukocytes induced a substantial amount of IL-8 ( peak at 18 h : 5000 pg/ml ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> due to binding of NFkappaB to a consensus site in the IL-8 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">An increase in IL-1receptor antagonist(RA) production ( peak at 24 h : 12000 pg/ml ) by glucan phosphate-treated cells positively correlated with IL-8 levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Glucan phosphate induced significant binding to a known NFIL-6 site and a new NFAT site within the IL-1RA promoter , which was confirmed by inhibition experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">When applied in combination with either LPS or TSST-1 at the same time points , we detected that glucan phosphate elevated the LPS- and the TSST-1-induced DNA binding of NFkappaB , NFIL-6 and NFAT , leading to a synergistic increase of IL-1RA .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Further , glucan phosphate modulated the TSST-1-induced inflammatory response via reduction of IL-1beta and IL-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">As a consequence , glucan phosphate shifted the TSST-1-induced IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Subsequently , glucan phosphate decreased the TSST-1-induced , IL-1-dependent production of IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Conclusion</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Thus , beta-1-->3-D-glucans <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> induce beneficial effects in the presence of pro-inflammatory responses , downstream of receptor binding and signaling by switching a pro- to an anti-inflammatory IL-1RA-mediated reaction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Our results also offer new insights into the complex regulation of the IL-1RA gene , which can be modulated by a beta-1-->3-D-glucan .</sentence>
