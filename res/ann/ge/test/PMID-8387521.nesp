<sentence id="0">A chimeric type II/type I interleukin-1 receptor can mediate interleukin-1 induction of gene expression in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The type I interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) is capable of transducing a signal resulting in promoter activation in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This signal transduction is dependent on the cytoplasmic domain , which consists of 213 amino acids .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast to the type I receptor , the type II IL-1R has a small cytoplasmic tail , and it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">not clear</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> this receptor is <scope type="spec" id="2"> a signal-transducing <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> a regulatory molecule</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we report that the type II IL-1R does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> mediate gene activation in Jurkat cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , a hybrid receptor composed of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the human type II interleukin-1 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the human type I IL-1R was capable of transducing a signal across the membrane resulting in a pattern of gene activation identical to that mediated by the type I IL-1R .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicated that</cue> the extracellular domain of the type II IL-1R was capable of functionally interacting with interleukin-1 and transmitting the resulting signal to a heterologous cytoplasmic domain</scope> .</sentence>
