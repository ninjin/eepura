<sentence id="0">Transcriptional activation of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene by IL-2 is associated with secretion of bioactive macrophage colony-stimulating factor protein by monocytes and involves activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human peripheral blood monocytes ( Mo ) constitutively display the beta-chain of the receptor for IL-2 , whereas expression of the IL-2R alpha-chain is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> constitutive</scope> but inducible with IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we report that binding of human IL-2 to its binding site leads to transcriptional activation of the macrophage CSF ( M-CSF ) gene in Mo resulting in accumulation of M-CSF mRNA and subsequent release of bioactive M-CSF protein as demonstrated by ELISA and inhibition of IL-2 induced release of an activity-stimulating growth of monocyte-type colonies by a neutralizing anti-M-CSF antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Transcriptional activation of the M-CSF gene by IL-2 is preceded by enhanced binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its recognition sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the M-CSF gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , using a heterologous promoter ( herpes thymidine kinase ) construct containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence , it is shown that NF-kappa B binding by an IL-2-induced monocyte-derived nuclear protein confers reporter gene ( human growth hormone ) activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Taken together , our findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> IL-2 induces gene expression of M-CSF in human blood-derived Mo</scope> and provide evidence for involvement of NF-kappa B in transcriptional regulation of this gene .</sentence>
