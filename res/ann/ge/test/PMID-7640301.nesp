<sentence id="0">Transcription factors as targets for oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We previously have demonstrated a requirement for oxidative events during cell cycle entry in T lymphocytes and have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesised</cue> that reactive oxygen species <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> act as intracellular signalling agents during lymphocyte activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the current study , cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with antioxidant activity , has been used to further investigate the role of oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Treatment of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes with cysteamine in vitro was found to inhibit proliferation in a dose-dependent manner , with essentially complete inhibition occurring at a dose of 400 microM .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This inhibitory effect was limited to the first 2 h after mitogenic activation , localizing the time-frame of action of cysteamine to within the commitment period .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It therefore was of interest to establish which , if any , commitment events were affected by oxidative signalling during cell cycle entry .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taking the IL-2 gene as a candidate , we examined the effect of cysteamine treatment on early gene expression during lymphocyte activation , and on the activity of transcription factors AP-1 , NF-kappa B , NF-AT and Oct1 , whose functions are required for expression of the IL-2 mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Cysteamine treatment inhibited both expression of the IL-2 mRNA and secretion of IL-2 into the culture medium .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="2"> The inhibitory effect of cysteamine <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be mediated at least in part by an effect on transcription factor function</scope> , as the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and NF-kappa B extracted from mitogen-stimulated cells were significantly inhibited by cysteamine treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Interestingly , <scope type="neg" id="3">Oct1 and NF-AT DNA binding activity were <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affected by cysteamine treatment</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that oxidative signalling processes operate in a selective manner</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The identification of regulatory proteins , such as transcription factors , as molecular targets for oxidative signalling provides further evidence to implicate oxidative signalling as being intimately involved in the G0 to G1 phase transition in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
