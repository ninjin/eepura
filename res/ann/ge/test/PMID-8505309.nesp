<sentence id="0">Lipopolysaccharide induces phosphorylation of MAD3 and activation of c-Rel and related NF-kappa B proteins in human monocytic THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Many effects of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) on gene expression , including that of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , in monocytic cells are mediated by activation of kappa B DNA-binding proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the specific members of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family involved in the LPS response , and the mechanisms through which LPS-generated signals are transduced remain unclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that LPS induces nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 heterodimers as well as p50/p65 ( NF-kappa B ) kappa B DNA-binding complexes in human monocytic THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Nuclear localization of these proteins occurred concomitantly with a rapid decrease in their cytosolic levels and was independent of phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Within 24 h following LPS stimulation there was a striking increase in the levels of c-Rel , p105 , and p50 in the cytosol .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The increased levels of these proteins correlated with increases in the amounts of their mRNAs during LPS activation of THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">LPS activation of THP-1 cells resulted in phosphorylation of MAD3 ( an I kappa B-like protein ) , a rapid increase in MAD3 mRNA , and an increase in MAD3 protein by 2 h. Thus , LPS activation of human monocytic cells results in nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 and p50/p65 ( NF-kappa B ) and induces phosphorylation of MAD3 .</sentence>
