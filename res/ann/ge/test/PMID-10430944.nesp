<sentence id="0">The Epstein-Barr virus latency BamHI-Q promoter is positively regulated by STATs and Zta interference with JAK/STAT activation leads to loss of BamHI-Q promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumors in nonimmunocompromised patients , EBV gene expression is highly restricted .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1 is expressed , whereas the immunogenic and proliferative EBNAs are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This pattern of EBNA expression is generated by usage of the BamHI-Q promoter ( Qp ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have determined that the JAK/STAT pathway positively regulates Qp activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In transient-transfection assays , a Qp-CAT reporter was activated by cotransfected JAK-1 and by treatment of cells with the cytokine IL-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The ability of Qp to bind signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins was directly demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay , and mutation of potential STAT-binding sites reduced Qp responsiveness to Janus kinase (JAK)-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with a role for STATs in Qp function , Qp using Burkitt 's lymphoma Rael cells and cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) cells contained nuclear STAT protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the inability to maintain EBV-positive NPC cell lines in culture was related to Qp activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Passaging of the NPC cell line HK666 led to activation of expression of BZLF1 , which encodes Zta and loss of Qp function .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Transient expression assays linked Zta expression to the down-regulation of Qp. Cotransfection of Zta reduced Qp activity in reporter assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This negative regulation required Zta DNA-binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We provide evidence that Zta up-regulation of p53 leads to p53-mediated interference with JAK/STAT activation of Qp. The data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">imply</cue> that JAK/STAT signaling has a role in EBV-associated malignancies</scope> .</sentence>
