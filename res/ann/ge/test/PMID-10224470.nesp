<sentence id="0">Signal transduction through interferon-gamma receptor on human eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : We reported on the constitutive interferon-gamma receptor ( IFN-gammaR ) expression on eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">But signal transduction through IFN-gammaR on eosinophils remains to be elucidated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we examined the involvement of the Jak/Stat pathway in the signaling of eosinophils after IFN-gammaR conjugation by the ligand binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHODS : Purified peripheral eosinophils were stimulated with IFN-gamma at 37 degrees C for 1-60 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN-gammaR , Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1alpha was examined by immunoblotting .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Gel-shift assay was also examined to show the formation of Stat1alpha-DNA complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RESULTS : We show that binding of IFN-gamma to human eosinophils initiated a series of events that resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of not only the IFN-gammaRalpha chain but also Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , IFN-gamma enhanced the DNA-binding activity of Stat1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSION : These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> IFN-gamma affects eosinophils through its specific receptor and utilizes the Jak/Stat pathway as its mode of signaling</scope> .</sentence>
