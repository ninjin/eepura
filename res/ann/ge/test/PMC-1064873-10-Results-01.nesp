<sentence id="0">Resistance to IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma production in RA CD4+ T cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The CD28 costimulatory pathway is crucial for effective antigen-specific T-cell cytokine production , and IL-10 can directly suppress this response by inhibiting CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation and binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [ 24 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To evaluate the responsiveness of RA CD4+ T cells to IL-10 , purified PB CD4+ T cells from three patients with active RA and from three healthy controls were stimulated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody with or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> diluted concentrations of IL-10 for 36 hours , and IFN-gamma production was measured by ELISA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As shown in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">1 , IFN-gamma production by activated normal CD4+ T cells was mostly inhibited at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml IL-10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , RA CD4+ T cells were able to produce significant amounts of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 , and the maximal but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> complete inhibition</scope> by IL-10 was obtained at 10-100 ng/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We thus compared the levels of IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients with active disease ( multiple inflammatory joints , CRP level > / = 10 mg/l ) and inactive disease ( in remission , CRP level < 10 mg/l ) [ 26 ] and in healthy controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">There were <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> statistically significant differences in IFN-gamma production <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> IL-10 among these three groups</scope> ( Fig</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">2a ) , but the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IFN-gamma production was significantly limited in the active RA group as compared with the inactive RA group and healthy controls ( percentage decrease : active RA , 2.9 +/- 14.4 % ; inactive RA , 45.6 +/- 14.4 % ; controls , 65.8 +/- 7.9 % ) ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">2b ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">As a consequence , CD4+ T cells from active RA patients produced higher levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than did normal CD4+ T cells ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">2a ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In addition , we compared IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of IL-10 in active RA patients and in healthy controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Similarly , <scope type="neg" id="4">IL-2 production was <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> affected by 1 ng/ml IL-10 in RA patients</scope> ( percentage decrease , -2.1 +/- 13.8 % ) , while it was significantly reduced in healthy controls ( 61.1 +/- 13.7 % ; P < 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> RA CD4+ T cells become less susceptible to the immunoregulatory effect of IL-10 during the active phase</scope> .</sentence>
