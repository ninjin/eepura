<sentence id="1">Previous studies have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that gangliosides have an important role in cell signaling and recognition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="neg" id="1">their specific function in these processes has <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> been clearly defined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A mAb , R24 , that reacts specifically with a cell surface ganglioside ( GD3 ) has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation of T cells derived from human peripheral blood .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we have investigated the mechanisms by which the R24 mAb affects T cell functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have observed that the R24 mAb stimulates GD3+ T cell proliferation , cytotoxicity , and surface marker expression of IL-2R alpha-chain , IL-2R beta-chain , HLA-DR , CD11a , and CD11c .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , IFN-gamma activity but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> IL-1 , IL-2 , or IL-4 activity</scope> was present in culture supernatants 72 h after R24 stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In some donors , increased IL-6 and TNF-alpha activity also was detected after R24 treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , R24 treatment resulted in translocation of c-rel , but <scope type="spec" id="4"> little <cue type="spec" id="4">or</cue> <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> NF kappa B p50 or p65</scope></scope> , from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and an increase of NF kappa B binding complexes containing c-rel and p50 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This treatment also caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="10"><scope type="spec" id="5"> R24-stimulated increases in proliferation , cytotoxicity , and cell surface protein expression <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> be blocked by cyclosporin and staurosporin</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating that</cue> <scope type="spec" id="7"> cyclophilin/calcineurin and protein kinase C <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be involved in the R24 signaling pathway</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Additionally , herbimycin A , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , blocked the R24-stimulated increase in proliferation but <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> cytotoxicity</scope> at concentrations consistent with specificity for tyrosine kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These results <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggest</cue> that multiple biochemical pathways are involved in the activation of human T cells by R24</scope> .</sentence>
