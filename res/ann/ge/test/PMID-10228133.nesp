<sentence id="0">Increased glucocorticoid receptor beta in airway cells of glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoid (GC)-insensitive asthma is a challenging clinical problem that can be associated with life-threatening disease progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The molecular basis of GC insensitivity is unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Alternative splicing of the GC receptor ( GCR ) pre-mRNA generates a second GCR , termed GCRbeta , which does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> bind GC</scope> but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic GCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus increased expression of GCRbeta could account for glucocorticoid insensitivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were examined for GCRbeta immunoreactivity using a GCRbeta-specific antibody by immunohistochemical staining .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cell localization of GCRbeta expression was performed using a double immunostaining technique .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Patients with GC-insensitive asthma expressed a significantly higher number of GCRbeta-immunoreactive cells in their BAL and peripheral blood than GC-sensitive asthmatics or normal control subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , GCRbeta expression in GC-insensitive asthma was particularly high in airway T cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> which are <cue type="spec" id="1">thought</cue> to play a major role in the pathogenesis of asthma</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We also examined the expression of GCRbeta in specimens from the airways of patients with chronic bronchitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In chronic bronchitis , few cells were GCRbeta-positive and their numbers did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> differ significantly from normal control subjects</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We conclude that GC-insensitive asthma is associated with increased expression of GCRbeta in airway T cells .</sentence>
