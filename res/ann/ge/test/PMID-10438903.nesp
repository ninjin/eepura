<sentence id="0">Cutting edge : TCR stimulation by antibody and bacterial superantigen induces Stat3 activation in human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent data show that TCR/CD3 stimulation induces activation of Stat5 in murine T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that CD3 ligation by mAb and Staphylococcal enterotoxin ( SE ) induce a rapid , gradually accumulating , long-lasting tyrosine , and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 ( but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> Stat5 )</scope> in allogen-specific human CD4+ T cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast , IL-2 induces a rapid and transient tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Compared with IL-2 , CD3 ligation induces a delayed Stat3 binding to oligonucleotide probes from the ICAM-1 and IL-2R alpha promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">CD3-mediated activation of Stat3 is almost completely inhibited by a Src kinase inhibitor ( PP1 ) , whereas IL-2-induced Stat3 activation is unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In conclusion , we show that CD3 ligation by mAb and SE triggers a rapid , PP1-sensitive tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 in human CD4+ T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , we provide evidence that TCR/CD3 and IL-2 induce Stat3 activation via distinct signaling pathways .</sentence>
