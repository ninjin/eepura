<sentence id="0">Expression of tal-1 and GATA-binding proteins during human hematopoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tal-1 rearrangements are associated with nearly 30 % of human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tal-1 gene encodes a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> transcription factor</scope> with a basic helix-loop-helix domain and is known to be predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We investigated the pattern of tal-1 expression in purified human hematopoietic cells by in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both methods demonstrated that the tal-1 gene is expressed in megakaryocytes and erythroblasts as well as in basophilic granulocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the tal-1 1A promoter , which contains two consensus GATA-binding sites , is active mainly in these lineages</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Because the GATA-1 gene is known to transactivate several genes specific for the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mastocytic/basophilic lineages , we studied GATA-1 expression in these purified hematopoietic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We found that GATA-1 and tal-1 genes are coexpressed in these three lineages .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Remarkably , the expression of both genes is downmodulated during erythroid and megakaryocytic terminal maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In immature hematopoietic cells , tal-1 and GATA-1 genes are coexpressed in committed progenitors cells ( CD34+/CD38(2+) ) , whereas they are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> detectable in the most primitive cells ( CD34(2+)/CD38- )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In contrast , GATA-2 is strongly expressed in both most primitive and committed progenitors cells , whereas GATA-3 is mostly detected in most primitive ones .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Altogether our results strongly <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that GATA-1 modulates the transcription of tal-1 during the differentiation of the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and basosophilic lineages</scope> .</sentence>
