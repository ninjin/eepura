<sentence id="0">Inhibition of transcription factors led to reduced IL-1RA levels</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Pharmacological inhibitors were used to demonstrate that the transcription factor sites within the IL-1RA promoter are relevant for the induction of IL-1RA by GP .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As expected , <scope type="neg" id="0">an inhibition of NFkappaB via CAPE [ 35 ] and CyA , NFAT via CyA and NFIL-6 via CHX [ 36 ] <cue type="neg" id="0">could not</cue> be overruled by GP</scope> , leading to a down-regulated binding activity of the transcription factors to the IL-1RA sites , and a reduction of IL-1RA mRNA and IL-1RA protein levels ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">7 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The extent of reduction in NFATP2/3 binding is exemplarily shown in an autoradiogram ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">7A , left side ) and graphically summarized ( n = 4 , Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">7A , right side ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results for the NFkappaB and NFIL-6 binding sites were similar <scope type="neg" id="1">( data <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Because the highest IL-1RA amount was found at 24 h , mRNA was examined following 1 h inhibition and 18 h of GP .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">A representative gel demonstrating a decrease in IL-1RA mRNA after inhibition with CAPE , CyA and CHX is displayed in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">7B ( n = 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In addition , corresponding IL-1RA protein levels after 24 h of GP are shown in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">7C ( n = 3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Altogether , NFkappaB inhibition by CAPE was more pronounced at the binding activity and the transcription , whereas CyA and CHX mainly led to a decreased IL-1RA release .</sentence>
