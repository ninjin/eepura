<sentence id="1">To investigate further the intracellular signaling pathway activated by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 , concanavalin A , PHA and IL-15 , and responsible for inducing IL-17 expression , we performed an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay ( EMSA ) of NF-kappaB recognition sites in the promoters of IL-17 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As shown in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">7a , nuclear extracts from RA PBMC stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ( lane 2 ) demonstrated increased binding of NF-kappaB to IL-17 promoters in comparison with that of controls ( lane 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A supershift assay demonstrated shifted bands in p65 and p50 ( lanes 3 and 4 ) not in c-Rel ( lane 5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In normal PBMC the same pattern was observed , but the degree of NF-kappaB activation by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was less intense than that in RA PBMC ( Fig .</sentence>
