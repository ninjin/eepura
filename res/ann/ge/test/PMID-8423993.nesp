<sentence id="0">Ras oncogene transformation of human B lymphoblasts is associated with lymphocyte activation and with a block of differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The p21ras small GTP binding proteins participate in signal transduction from cell surface receptors and affect neoplastic transformation and development in many different cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we examined the relationship between ras transformation and differentiation of human B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that the constitutive expression of the T24 Ha-ras oncogene in EBV-immortalized B lymphoblasts was associated with the induction of the interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit , with an impaired immunoglobulin gene expression , altered adhesion properties and increased survival in serum-free medium .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Since induction of the IL-2 receptor alpha subunit is a hallmark of lymphocyte activation , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that p21ras naturally triggers B cell activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The ras-transformed lymphocytes displayed a fully functional IL-2r , as assessed by c-fos induction following treatment with IL-2 ; nevertheless , <scope type="neg" id="1">they were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> growth stimulated by this lymphokine</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The decreased expression of immunoglobulin genes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates that</cue> the ras oncogene blocks terminal differentiation to plasma cells , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibly</cue> by inhibiting the activity of lymphocyte-specific transcription factors</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Somewhat unexpectedly , the constitutive p21ras activity did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> cause an increased DNA binding of transcription factors PEA1 ( AP1 ) , PEA3 , Oct-2 or NF-kB</scope> .</sentence>
