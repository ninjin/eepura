<sentence id="0">Phosphorylation of the transcription factor NFATp inhibits its DNA binding activity in cyclosporin A-treated human B and T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , thus preventing transcriptional induction of several cytokine genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> This effect is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be largely mediated through inactivation of the phosphatase calcineurin , which in turn inhibits translocation of an NFAT component to the nucleus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report that CsA treatment of Raji B and Jurkat T cell lines yields a phosphorylated form of NFATp that is inhibited in DNA-binding and in its ability to form an NFAT complex with Fos and Jun .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Immunoblot analyses and metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate show that CsA alters NFATp migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by increasing its phosphorylation level <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> affecting subcellular distribution</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Dephosphorylation by in vitro treatment with calcineurin or alkaline phosphatase restores NFATp DNA binding activity and its ability to reconstitute an NFAT complex with Fos and Jun proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data point to a new mechanism for CsA-sensitive regulation of NFATp in which dephosphorylation is critical for DNA binding .</sentence>
