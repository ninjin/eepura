<sentence id="0">1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 induces differentiation of a retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line ( UF-1 ) associated with expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Retinoic acid ( RA ) resistance is a serious problem for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) who are receiving all-trans RA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the mechanisms and strategies to overcome RA resistance by APL cells are still <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The biologic effects of RA are mediated by two distinct families of transcriptional factors : RA receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RXRs heterodimerize with 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25(OH)2D3 ] receptor ( VDR ) , enabling their efficient transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The cyclin-dependent kinase ( cdk ) inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) has a vitamin D3-responsive element ( VDRE ) in its promoter , and 1,25(OH)2D3 enhances the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and induces differentiation of selected myeloid leukemic cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have recently established a novel APL cell line ( UF-1 ) with features of RA resistance .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">1,25(OH)2D3 can induce growth inhibition and G1 arrest of UF-1 cells , resulting in differentiation of these cells toward granulocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This 1 , 25(OH)2D3-induced G1 arrest is enhanced by all-trans RA .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Also , 1 , 25(OH)2D3 ( 10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/L ) in combination with RA markedly inhibits cellular proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Associated with these findings , the levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) mRNA and protein increased in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Northern blot analysis showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) mRNA and protein increased in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Northern blot analysis showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) transcripts were induced after 6 hours ' exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 and then decreased to basal levels over 48 hours .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Western blot experiments showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein levels increased and became detectable after 12 hours of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and induction of p27(KIP1) protein was much more gradual and sustained in UF-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Interestingly , the combination of 1 , 25(OH)2D3 and RA markedly enhanced the levels of p27(KIP1) transcript and protein as compared with levels induced by 1 , 25(OH)2D3 alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">In addition , exogenous p27(KIP1) expression can enhance the level of CD11b antigen in myeloid leukemic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In contrast , RA alone can induce G1 arrest of UF-1 cells ; however , it did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> result in an increase of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) transcript and protein expression in RA-resistant cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Taken together , we conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 induces increased expression of cdk inhibitors , which mediates a G1 arrest , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> this <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be associated with differentiation of RA-resistant UF-1 cells toward mature granulocytes</scope> .</sentence>
