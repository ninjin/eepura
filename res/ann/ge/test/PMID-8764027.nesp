<sentence id="0">Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of myeloid cells disrupts the autoregulatory control of the NF-kappaB/Rel pathway via enhanced IkappaBalpha degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection causes sustained NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in chronically infected monocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A direct temporal correlation exists between HIV infection and the appearance of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in myelomonoblastic PLB-985 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To examine the molecular basis of constitutive NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in HIV1 -infected cells , we analyzed the phosphorylation and turnover of IkappaBalpha protein , the activity of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) and the intracellular levels of NF-kappaB subunits in the PLB-985 and U937 myeloid cell models .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HIV-1 infection resulted in constitutive , low-level expression of type 1 interferon ( IFN ) at the mRNA level .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Constitutive PKR activity was also detected in HIV-1-infected cells as a result of low-level IFN production , since the addition of anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibody to the cells decreased PKR expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the analysis of IkappaBalpha turnover demonstrated an increased degradation of IkappaBalpha in HIV-1-infected cells that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> account for the constitutive DNA binding activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of NF-kappaB subunits c-Rel and NF-kappaB2 p100 and a moderate increase in NF-kappaB2 p52 and RelA(p65) were detected in HIV-1-infected cells , whereas <scope type="neg" id="1">NF-kappaB1 p105/p50 levels were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> altered relative to the levels in uninfected cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that HIV-1 infection of myeloid cells induces IFN production and PKR activity , which in turn contribute to enhanced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and subsequent degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunits <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> ultimately increase the intracellular pool of NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha by an autoregulatory mechanism</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Enhanced turnover of IkappaBalpha and the accumulation of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> contribute to the chronically activated state of HIV-1-infected cells</scope> .</sentence>
