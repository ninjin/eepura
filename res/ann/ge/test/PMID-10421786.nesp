<sentence id="0">Activation of STAT5 by IL-4 relies on Janus kinase function but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> on receptor tyrosine phosphorylation</scope> , and can contribute to both cell proliferation and gene regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have investigated mechanisms and consequences of STAT5 activation through the human IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">By functionally expressing receptor mutants in the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 , we could show that phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the IL-4R alpha chain are dispensable for IL-4-induced STAT5 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , disruption of a membrane-proximal proline-rich sequence motif ( ' box1 ' ) in either subunit of the bipartite IL-4R abolished not only ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 , but also IL-4-triggered activation of STAT5 and concomitant cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A dominant-negative version of STAT5b , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> of STAT5a</scope> , interfered with IL-4-induced DNA synthesis in Ba/F3 cells , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> an involvement of STAT5b in the control of cell proliferation through IL-4R</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Reporter gene experiments finally showed that transcription from promoters of STAT5 target genes can be specifically induced by challenging cells with IL-4 , and that both STAT5a and STAT5b can contribute to IL-4-triggered transcriptional control .</sentence>
