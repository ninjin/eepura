<sentence id="0">Multiple proteins interact with the nuclear inhibitory protein repressor element in the human interleukin-3 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T cell expression of interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) is directed by positive and negative cis-acting DNA elements clustered within 300 base pairs of the transcriptional start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A strong repressor element , termed nuclear inhibitory protein ( NIP ) , was previously mapped to a segment of the IL-3 promoter between nucleotides -271 and -250 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Functional characterization of this element demonstrates that it can mediate repression when linked in cis to a heterologous promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DNA binding experiments were carried out to characterize the repressor activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using varying conditions , three distinct complexes were shown to interact specifically with the NIP region , although only one correlates with repressor activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Complex 1 results from binding of a ubiquitous polypeptide that recognizes the 3' portion of this sequence and is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for repression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Complex 2 corresponds to binding of transcription factor ( upstream stimulatory factor ) to an E-box motif in the 5' portion of the NIP region .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">DNA binding specificity of complex 3 overlaps with that of upstream stimulatory factor but is clearly distinct .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">To determine which of the latter two complexes represents NIP activity , we incorporated small alterations into the NIP site of an IL-3 promoter-linked reporter construct and examined their effects on NIP-mediated repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Functional specificity for repression matches the DNA binding specificity of complex 3 ; both repressor activity and complex 3 binding require the consensus sequence CTCACNTNC .</sentence>
