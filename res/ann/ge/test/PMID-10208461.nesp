<sentence id="0">Bcl-6 expression in reactive follicular hyperplasia , follicular lymphoma , and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with hyperplastic germinal centers : heterogeneity of intrafollicular T-cells and their altered distribution in the pathogenesis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : The Bcl-6 gene product , a nuclear phosphoprotein , is expressed independently of Bcl-6 gene rearrangement .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In lymph nodes , expression of Bcl-6 protein is restricted to germinal center ( GC ) B-cells and 10 % to 15 % of CD3/CD4+ intrafollicular T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Interfollicular cells are negative for Bcl-6 protein , except for rare CD3+/CD4+ T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recently , we reported cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) with hyperplastic GCs ( AITL/GC ) , and observed that borders of enlarged GCs were ill defined , with features <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggestive</cue> of an outward migration of GC cells</scope> to surrounding interfollicular zones .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This prompted a study of follicular borders with Bcl-6 staining in reactive follicular hyperplasias and follicular lymphomas to compare with AITL/GC .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">MATERIALS AND METHODS : Formalin-fixed paraffin sections were used for immunostaining of Bcl-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Six cases of AITL/GC , 12 nonspecific reactive follicular hyperplasia ( FH ) , 7 HIV adenopathy , 10 follicular lymphoma ( FL ) , and 8 typical AITL ( ie , AITL <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> GC</scope> ) were studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Double staining for Bcl-6/CD20 , Bcl-6/CD3 , and Bcl-6/CD57 was performed in selected cases .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">RESULTS : In FH and HIV adenopathy , staining for Bcl-6 revealed densely populated GCs with well-defined and regular GC borders , whereas Bcl-6+ cells were rare in the interfollicular areas .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">An occasional GC with an ill-defined border was invariably surrounded by a broad mantle zone ; those with indistinct mantle zones had well-defined , regular borders .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In FL , follicles were densely populated , and their borders were irregular , with some Bcl-6+ cells in the interfollicular zones .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In AITL/GC , GCs were less dense , GC borders were ill defined and irregular , and the number of interfollicular Bcl-6+ cells was markedly increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Double staining revealed that these interfollicular Bcl-6+ cells in AITL/GC were Bcl6+/CD3+/CD20-/CD57- T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Moreover , CD3+ intrafollicular T cells were depleted in AITL/GC , whereas they were abundant in FH .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Intrafollicular CD57+ cells did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> stain for Bcl-6</scope> , and were also depleted in AITL/GC .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In typical AITL , some neoplastic cells were positive for Bcl-6 , showing variable degrees of staining .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">CONCLUSIONS : ( 1 ) GCs of AITL/GC differed from those of other reactive follicular hyperplasias and follicular lymphomas , and staining for Bcl-6 was useful to discern them .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">( 2 ) Intrafollicular CD3+ T cells , many of which were also positive for Bcl-6 , were markedly depleted in AITL/GC , with increased interfollicular Bcl-6+/CD3+ cells , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> an outward migration of intrafollicular T cells in this condition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">( 3 ) Interfollicular Bcl-6+/CD3+ cells in AITL/GC were too numerous to be accounted for by migration alone , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> local proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">( 4 ) Intrafollicular CD57+ cells were <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">negative</cue> for Bcl-6</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating</cue> heterogeneity of the intrafollicular T-cell population</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">( 5 ) Some neoplastic cells in AITL stained for Bcl-6 , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggesting</cue> up-regulation of Bcl-6 expression in this tumor</scope> .</sentence>
