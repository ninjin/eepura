<sentence id="1">Real-time PCR assays ( Figure 1 ) measure steady-state levels of epsilony mRNA , not transcriptional activity of the epsilony promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> Sox6 directly acts on the epsilony gene promoter at the transcriptional level</scope> , we used an in vitro transient transfection assay and GM979 cells , a murine erythroleukemic cell line that expresses both epsilony and adult beta globins [ 30 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We generated an epsilony promoter reporter construct ( E-Luc ) by fusing a micro-LCR ( muLCR ) element ( 2.5 kb ) [ 31 ] to the epsilony proximal promoter ( 2.2 kb ) , followed by the luciferase reporter gene , as shown in Figure 2A ( detailed in Materials and Methods ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Overexpression of Sox6 in GM979 cells by transient transfection leads to a dosage-dependent repression of E-Luc reporter activity ( Figure 2B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , overexpression of a truncated Sox6 protein that <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> its HMG domain</scope> [ 32 ] ( similar to the p100H mouse allele ) <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">fails</cue> to repress E-Luc activity ( Figure 2B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> Sox6 acts to repress the epsilony promoter at the transcriptional level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Sox6 has been shown to act as a repressor and to interact with a widely expressed co-repressor , CtBP2 , on the fgf-3 promoter [ 5 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">CtBP2 is expressed in GM979 cells ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">whether</cue> the interaction with CtBP2 is required for Sox6 repression of the epsilony promoter</scope> , we introduced a point mutation ( L386H ) in the Sox6 protein that has been previously reported to be sufficient to abolish Sox6-CtBP2 interaction [ 5 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This amino acid change is <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> in the HMG DNA binding domain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , this mutant version of Sox6 retains the ability to repress the epsilony promoter in the transfection assay ( Figure 2B ) , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating that</cue> Sox6 represses the epsilony promoter in a CtBP2-independent manner</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Deletion analysis of the epsilony promoter , as shown in Figure 2C , defined a region ( -63 to -37 ) within the epsilony proximal promoter that is critical for Sox6 repression .</sentence>
