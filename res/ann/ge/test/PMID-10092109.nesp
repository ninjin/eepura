<sentence id="1">The resolution of immune responses is characterized by extensive apoptosis of activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , to generate and maintain immunological memory , some antigen-specific T cells must survive and revert to a resting G0/G1 state .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cytokines that bind to the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor promote the survival of T cell blasts , but also induce proliferation .</sentence>

<sentence id="7">Type I interferons and stromal cells stimulate apparently identical signaling pathways , leading to STAT-1 activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We also show that this mechanism <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> play a fundamental role in the persistence of T cells at sites of chronic inflammation</scope> ; <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that chronic inflammation is an aberrant consequence of immunological memory</scope> .</sentence>
