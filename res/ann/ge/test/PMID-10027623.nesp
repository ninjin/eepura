<sentence id="0">Phenotypic and functional studies of leukocytes in human endometrium and endometriosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The aetiology of endometriosis , a common and disabling disorder , is presently unknown , although immune dysfunction could allow ectopic endometrial fragments to survive outside the uterine cavity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These studies investigate the relationship between leukocyte populations , steroid hormone receptor expression , proliferative activity , bcl-2 expression and apoptosis in eutopic and ectopic endometrium from women with endometriosis or adenomyosis at different phases of the menstrual cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Significantly increased oestrogen receptor expression , bcl-2 expression and numbers of CD8+ leukocytes were found in ectopic compared with eutopic endometrium in endometriosis , and CD56+ endometrial granulated lymphocytes ( eGLs ) were significantly reduced in ectopic endometrium .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Apoptotic cells were rarely found in control and subject endometria .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast with endometriosis , adenomyotic lesions showed identical steroid hormone receptor expression , proliferative activity , bcl-2 expression and leukocyte subpopulations to eutopic endometrium , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> different aetiologies for these disorders</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The unusual CD56+ CD16- eGLs present in large numbers in late secretory phase eutopic endometrium were highly purified ( > 98 % ) by immunomagnetic separation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Except for a negligible cytotoxic activity of eGLs from early proliferative samples , cytotoxic activity of eGLs from non-pregnant endometrium during the menstrual cycle was comparable with those in peripheral blood , predominantly CD56+ CD16+ natural killer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">eGLs from non-pregnant endometrium and early pregnancy showed a variable proliferative response to 5 and 100 U/ml interleukin-2 over 48-h and 120-h time courses .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">eGLs are evidently functionally important in the eutopic endometrium .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Their absence in endometriotic lesions together with increased CD+8 T-cell numbers and increased oestrogen receptor and bcl-2 expression <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> have significant effects on the development and progression of endometriosis</scope> .</sentence>
