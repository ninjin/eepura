<sentence id="0">Block of granulocytic differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells by AML1/ETO(MTG8) but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> by highly expressed Bcl-2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The chimeric gene , AML1/ETO ( MTG8 ) , generated in t(8 ; 21 ) acute myeloid leukemia enhances the expression of Bcl-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To evaluate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> this enhancement is the primary role of AML1/ETO in leukemogenesis</scope> , effects of over-expression of Bcl-2 in the murine myeloid precursor cell line , 32Dcl3 , were examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">When 32Dcl3 cells expressing exogenous Bcl-2 were induced to differentiate , the onset of morphological differentiation was delayed .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , even the cells expressing very high levels of exogenous Bcl-2 eventually underwent differentiation <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> a significant decrease in the synthesis of Bcl-2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">On the contrary , 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing AML1/ETO were completely resistant to differentiation and continued to grow in the presence of G-CSF .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results are consistent with the interpretation that stimulation of Bcl-2 expression is not the primary target of AML1/ETO .</sentence>
