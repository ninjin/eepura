<sentence id="0">Oncogenicity of human papillomavirus- or adenovirus-transformed cells correlates with resistance to lysis by natural killer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The reasons for the dissimilar oncogenicities of human adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) in humans are unknown but <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> relate to differences in the capacities of the E1A and E7 proteins to target cells for rejection by the host natural killer ( NK ) cell response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As one test of this <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> , we compared the abilities of E1A- and E7-expressing human fibroblastic or keratinocyte-derived human cells to be selectively killed by either unstimulated or interferon (IFN)-activated NK cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cells expressing the E1A oncoprotein were selectively killed by unstimulated NK cells , while the same parental cells but expressing the HPV type 16 ( HPV-16 ) or HPV-18 E7 oncoprotein were resistant to NK cell lysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The ability of IFN-activated NK cells to selectively kill virally transformed cells depends on IFN 's ability to induce resistance to NK cell lysis in normal ( i.e. , non-viral oncogene-expressing ) but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> virally transformed cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">E1A blocked IFN 's induction of cytolytic resistance , resulting in the selective lysis of adenovirus-transformed cells by IFN-activated NK cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The extent of IFN-induced NK cell killing of E1A-expressing cells was proportional to the level of E1A expression and correlated with the ability of E1A to block IFN-stimulated gene expression in target cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , E7 blocked <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">neither</cue> IFN-stimulated gene expression <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">nor</cue> IFN 's induction of cytolytic resistance</scope></scope> , thereby precluding the selective lysis of HPV-transformed cells by IFN-activated NK cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In conclusion , E1A expression marks cells for destruction by the host NK cell response , whereas the E7 oncoprotein <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">lacks</cue> this activity</scope> .</sentence>
