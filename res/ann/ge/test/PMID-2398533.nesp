<sentence id="0">The internal methionine codons of human T-cell leukemia virus type II rex gene are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for p24rex production or virus replication and transformation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human T-cell leukemia virus types I ( HTLV-I ) and II ( HTLV-II ) have two nonstructural trans-acting regulatory genes , tax and rex , located in the 3' region of the viral genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The tax gene product ( HTLV-I p40tax and HTLV-II p37tax ) is the transcriptional activator of the viral long terminal repeat .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The rex gene encodes two protein products , p27rex/p21rex and p26rex/p24rex in HTLV-I and HTLV-II , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate accumulation of full-length gag/pol and singly spliced env mRNA in the cytoplasm of HTLV-infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Previous studies showed that the first ATG of the rex gene is critical for Rex production and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The importance of the internal ATGs to Rex function is <cue type="spec" id="1">not</cue> known</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , in vitro mutagenesis of the HTLV-I rex gene has provided indirect evidence which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that p21rex , and by analogy HTLV-II p24rex , results from initiation at an internal AUG of the tax/rex mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">By using an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-II , we investigated the importance of the internal ATGs of the rex gene on Rex protein production and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> p24rex of HTLV-II is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> initiated at an internal AUG</scope> and that the internal methionine codons are <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> crucial to the function of the rex gene</scope> and , ultimately , the transforming properties of the virus</scope> .</sentence>
