<sentence id="0">Osteoclast markers accumulate on cells developing from human peripheral blood mononuclear precursors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent studies show that human osteoclasts develop in vitro from hematopoietic cells ; however , special cultures conditions and/or cytokine mobilized peripheral blood are apparently required .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we report that cells expressing osteoclast markers differentiate from precursors present in nonmobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> the addition of stromal cells</scope> , growth factors , cytokines or steroids ; and characterize their phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Three days after establishing high-density PBMC cultures ( 1.5 x 10(6) cells/cm2 ) , in serum-containing medium , small adherent colonies of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive ( TRAP+ ) cells emerge , amidst massive monocyte cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These adherent cells have an eccentrically placed , round nucleus , and express low levels of TRAP and sodium fluoride-resistant- alpha-naphthyl-acetate-esterase ( NaF-R-NSE ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Over the next week , this cell population accumulates phenotypic markers of osteoclasts ( vitronectin receptor [ VR ] , calcitonin receptor , TRAP , cathepsin K protein , and mRNA ) with increased nuclearity , covering the entire surface by 15 days .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">When cultured on bone , VR+ , TRAP+ cells of low multinuclearity appear and cover up to 50 % of the surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Resorption lacunae can be observed by day 22 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although these pits are <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> nearly as numerous as the cells of preosteoclast phenotype</scope> , they do represent the activity of a subset of osteoclast-like cells that has achieved osteoclastic maturity under these culture conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Transcripts for osteoprotegerin ligand ( OPGL ) , an osteoclast differentiation factor ( also known as RANKL and TRANCE ) are expressed , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> by adherent cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Thus , an adherent population of cells , with preosteoclast/osteoclast phenotypic properties , arises selectively under simple culture conditions from normal PBMC .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Further characterization of these cells <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">should</cue> identify factors involved in the growth , terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts</scope> .</sentence>
