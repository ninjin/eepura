<sentence id="1">The results presented identify the first genetic lesion associated with DLCL , the most clinically relevant form of NHL .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> proof yet exists of a role for these lesions in DLCL pathogenesis</scope> , the feature of the BCL-6 gene product , its specific pattern of expression in B cells , and the clustering of lesions disrupting its regulatory domain strongly <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that deregulation of BCL-6 expression <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> contribute to DLCL development</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A more precise definition of the role of BCL-6 in normal and neoplastic B-cell development is the goal of ongoing study of transgenic mice engineered either to express BCL-6 under heterologous promoters or <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lacking</cue> BCL-6 function</scope> due to targeted deletions .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition to contributing to the understanding of DLCL pathogenesis , the identification of BCL-6 lesions <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> have relevant clinical implications</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">DLCL represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms which are treated homogeneously despite the fact that only 50 % of patients experience long-term disease-free survival ( Schneider et al. 1990 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The fact that BCL-6 rearrangements identify biologically and clinically distinct subsets of DLCL <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that these lesions <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be useful as markers in selection of differential therapeutic strategies based on different risk groups</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , the BCL-6 rearrangements can be used to identify and monitor the malignant clone with sensitive PCR-based techniques .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Since clinical remission has been observed in a significant fraction of DLCL cases , these markers <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> serve as critical tools for sensitive monitoring of minimal residual disease and early diagnosis of relapse</scope> ( Gribben et al. 1993 ) .</sentence>
