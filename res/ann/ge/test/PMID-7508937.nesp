<sentence id="0">rel Is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated following granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment of human neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Stimulation of neutrophils with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) results in an enhanced respiratory burst , prolonged survival , and increased tumor cell killing .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The effects of G-CSF are mediated by binding to specific , high affinity receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">G-CSF receptors <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity</scope> , but activation of the receptor results in the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell lysates prepared from neutrophils show that the G-CSF rapidly induces prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of a relative molecular mass of 80 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using monospecific antibodies , the 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein has been shown to be p80c-rel , a proto-oncogene belonging to a family of transcriptional regulators which include NF-kB .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel was unique to G-CSF in that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which also stimulates neutrophils and induces tyrosine phosphorylation does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> result in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="2">The consequences of p80c-rel tyrosine phosphorylation are <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> yet known</scope> ; however , tyrosine-phosphorylated p80c-rel is capable of binding to DNA , and G-CSF stimulation results in an increase in the amount of p80c-rel which binds to DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results demonstrate that one of the first biochemical events which occurs in neutrophils following G-CSF stimulation , activation of a tyrosine kinase , leads directly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c-rel .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="3"> the tyrosine kinase activated by G-CSF <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to directly transduce a signal to a protein which functions as a transcriptional regulator</scope> .</sentence>
