<sentence id="1">Adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and E1A transfection were used to model changes in susceptibility to NK cell killing caused by transient vs stable E1A expression in human cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Only stably transfected target cells exhibited cytolytic susceptibility , despite expression of equivalent levels of E1A proteins in Ad-infected targets .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="1">The inability of E1A gene products to induce cytolytic susceptibility during infection was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> explained by an inhibitory effect of viral infection on otherwise susceptible target cells or by viral gene effects on class I MHC antigen expression on target cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This differential effect of E1A expression on the cytolytic phenotypes of infected and stably transfected human cells <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that human NK cells provide an effective immunologic barrier against the in vivo survival and neoplastic progression of E1A-immortalized cells that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> emerge from the reservoir of persistently infected cells in the human host</scope></scope> .</sentence>
