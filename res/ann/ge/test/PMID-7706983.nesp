<sentence id="0">Effects of intranasal glucocorticoids on endogenous glucocorticoid peripheral and central function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoids are among the most potent antiinflammatory agents that can be used in the treatment of rhinitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Their mechanisms of action are multiple and complex and a number of reports describe significant systemic effects of locally administered glucocorticoids .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to evaluate the short-term systemic effects of intranasally administered glucocorticoids , 14 normal healthy subjects were treated with two doses of either budesonide ( BUD ) or fluticasone propionate ( FP ) for 2 weeks .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Before treatment , at regular intervals during the treatment , 1 week and finally 6 weeks after termination of treatment , the effects on glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and methallothionein ( MTIIa ) mRNA expression levels were examined in peripheral lymphocytes using a solution hybridization assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Serum cortisol , osteocalcin and urinary cortisol levels were also determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">An insulin tolerance test ( ITT ) was performed at the end of the second week of treatment and at the end of the 6-week washout period with <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> statistically significant change in cortisol response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In peripheral lymphocytes , GR mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">MTIIa mRNA levels increased significantly .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Serum osteocalcin decreased significantly during treatment with both BUD and FP .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Serum cortisol decreased after 1 week of treatment whereas <scope type="neg" id="1">urinary cortisol was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affected until the second week of treatment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In conclusion , intranasal glucocorticoids at clinically recommended doses have <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> only significant systemic effects on adrenal function</scope> , but also have an effect on specific gene expression in peripheral lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These effects are receptor-dependent , reversible , and according to serum and urinary cortisol levels and ITT , leave the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function intact .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Finally , <scope type="neg" id="3">these short-term systemic effects were <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> associated with any of the noticeable side-effects usually observed during long-term treatment with glucocorticoids</scope> .</sentence>
