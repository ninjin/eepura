<sentence id="0">The NF-kappa B inhibitor , tepoxalin , suppresses surface expression of the cell adhesion molecules CD62E , CD11b/CD18 and CD106 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tepoxalin , a dual enzyme inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase has been shown to inhibit T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Its immunosuppressive property is distinct from cyclosporin because only tepoxalin , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> cyclosporin</scope> , suppresses NF-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report that tepoxalin selectively inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 , CD54 ) / MAC-1 ( CD11b/CD18 ) dependent adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells to IL-1 activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The mechanism of inhibition is related to the surface expression of several cell adhesion molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Flow cytometry analyses on cultured cells that were treated with tepoxalin or antisense oligonucleotides to the P65/p50 subunit of NF-kappa B , and then stimulated with PMA , revealed a reduced expression of CD11b/CD18 on monocytic HL60 cells , and endothelial adhesion molecule-1 ( CD62E ) and vascular adhesion molecule-1 ( CD106 ) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Expression of other adhesion molecules such as lymphocyte function associated-antigen-1 ( CD11a/CD18 ) and CD54 were unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Tepoxalin also inhibited the secretion of a NF-kappa B regulated chemokine , IL-8 , a known inducer of CD11b/CD18 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus the suppression of CD11b/CD18 expression by tepoxalin <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> involve IL-8</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that by inhibiting NF-kappa B activation , surface expression of several adhesion molecules can be modulated and that tepoxalin <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be useful in treating selected adhesion mediated events such as leukocyte migration or atherosclerotic plaque formation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
