<sentence id="1">Several mutants derived from transformed human B cell lines are defective in expressing major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The failure to express a class II gene in at least one such mutant line has been mapped to the MHC class II X box , a conserved transcriptional element in the promoter region .</sentence>
