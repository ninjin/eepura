<sentence id="0">Oxidative stress triggers STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in human lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxidizing agents are powerful activators of factors responsible for the transcriptional activation of cytokine-encoding genes involved in tissue injury .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study we show evidence that STAT3 is a transcription factor whose activity is modulated by H2O2 in human lymphocytes , in which endogenous catalase had previously been inhibited .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">H2O2-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 to form sequence-specific DNA-bound complexes was evidenced by immunoblotting of nuclear fractions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , and vanadate was found to strongly synergize with H2O2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , anti-STAT3 antibodies specifically precipitated a protein of 92 kDa that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine upon lymphocyte treatment with H2O2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Phenylarsine oxide , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , cooperated and cancelled , respectively , the H2O2-promoted STAT3 nuclear translocation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Evidence is also presented , using Fe2+/Cu2+ ions , that.OH generated from H2O2 through Fenton reactions could be a candidate oxygen reactive species to directly activate STAT3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Present data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that H2O2 and vanadate are <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to inhibit the activity of intracellular tyrosine phosphatase(s) , leading to enhanced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and hence its translocation to the nucleus</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of STAT3 can be modulated by oxidizing agents and provide a framework to understand the effects of oxidative stress on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway .</sentence>
