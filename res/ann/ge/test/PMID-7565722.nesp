<sentence id="0">A central role for a single c-Myb binding site in a thymic locus control region .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Locus control regions ( LCRs ) are powerful assemblies of cis elements that organize the actions of cell-type-specific trans-acting factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A 2.3-kb LCR in the human adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) gene first intron , which controls expression in thymocytes , is composed of a 200-bp enhancer domain and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We now show that the core contains a single critical c-Myb binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells , c-Myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">c-Myb protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA LCR-directed transgene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Point mutation of the c-Myb site within the intact 2.3-kb LCR severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and LCR activity in transgenic thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Within the context of a complex enhancer and LCR , c-Myb can act as an organizer of thymocyte-specific gene expression via a single binding site .</sentence>
