<sentence id="0">Differential regulation of IL-6 gene transcription and expression by IL-4 and IL-10 in human monocytic cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-4 and IL-10 inhibit the cytokine production and mRNA expression by monocytes/macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect on transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of IL-6 gene expression by IL-4 and IL-10 , we studied IL-6 production , expression level of IL-6 mRNA , IL-6 promoter activity , transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB and NF-IL-6 , and IL-6 mRNA stability in human monocytic cell lines , THP-1 and U937 , stimulated by PMA and LPS in the absence or the presence of IL-4 or IL-10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both IL-4 and IL-10 were seen to inhibit IL-6 production and the expression of IL-6 mRNA in both monocytic cell lines studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays , utilizing the transient transfection of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid containing the IL-6 gene promoter , IL-4 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> IL-10</scope> , suppressed the transcriptional activity of the IL-6 gene promoter stimulated by PMA and LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that IL-4 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> IL-10</scope> , inhibited nuclear NF-kappaB activity , and that IL-4 and IL-10 did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affect NF-IL-6 activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the other hand , IL-10 enhanced the degradation of IL-6 mRNA in a mRNA stability assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that IL-4 <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> inhibit the transcription of the IL-6 gene by affecting NF-kappaB binding activity , while IL-10 <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> inhibit the IL-6 mRNA levels post-transcriptionally , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> suppressing promoter activity</scope></scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , we conclude that IL-4 and IL-10 inhibit IL-6 production by different mechanisms in human monocytic cell lines .</sentence>
