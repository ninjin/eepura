<sentence id="0">The Expression Pattern of Sox6 Suggests a Role in Definitive Erythropoiesis</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The observation that Sox6-deficient mice ectopically express epsilony globin in liver , where definitive erythroid cells mature , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that Sox6 is an important regulator in definitive erythropoiesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Sox6 , Northern blot and in situ hybridization assays were employed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As shown in Figure 6A , Sox6 is detectable by Northern blot beginning at 10.5 dpc , coincident with the temporal onset of definitive erythropoiesis in the liver .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , in situ hybridization shows that Sox6 is highly transcribed in 12.5-dpc liver , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in yolk sac blood islands at 7.5 dpc ( Figure 6B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , Sox6 expression is temporally and spatially coincident with definitive , but not primitive , erythropoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data , taken together with the observation that epsilony globin is highly expressed in the liver cells of 14.5-dpc p100H mutant mice ( Figure 5 ) , demonstrate that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis .</sentence>
