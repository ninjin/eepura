<sentence id="3">Therefore , Sox proteins <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> perform part of their function as architectural proteins by organizing local chromatin structure and assembling other DNA-bound transcription factors into biologically active , sterically defined multiprotein complexes</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="7">Regardless of how Sox6 functions in regulating gene expression , previous studies have demonstrated that Sox6 is an important regulatory molecule that plays a role in the development of the central nervous system [ 8-11 ] , cartilage [ 6,12,13 ] , and muscle [ 14,15 ] .</sentence>

<sentence id="10">The p100H mutant allele is associated with a Chromosome 7 inversion that disrupts both the p gene and the Sox6 gene ( and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> other gene within 50,000 nucleotides of the chromosomal breakpoints ) [ 14</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Because the p gene functions solely in pigmentation [ 16 ] , the Sox6 transcription factor is implicated in all other phenotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Among the HMG box proteins distantly related to Sry ( the first member identified of the Sox transcription factor family ) that similarly bind to the minor groove and bend DNA , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> sequence specificity</scope> , are the ubiquitously expressed HMG1 and HMG2 proteins [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Modulation of DNA structure by these and other HMG proteins can mediate long-range enhancer function on both DNA and chromatin-assembled genes by bringing together distant regions of DNA and associated factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Specifically , HMG proteins have been shown to modulate beta-globin genes [ 18-21 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">The mouse beta-globin genes { epsilony , betah1 , beta-major , and beta-minor } are clustered on Chromosome 7 and they are highly homologous to their human counterparts in organizational structure and function [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">High-level expression of these genes requires a regulatory element , the locus control region that is characterized by a set of nuclease hypersensitive sites spread over 25 kb located 5' of the epsilony gene [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">The beta-globin genes are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">In mice , erythropoiesis originates in the embryonic yolk sac where primitive erythroid cells express epsilony and betah-1 globins [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">At 11.5 d post coitus ( dpc ) , erythropoiesis shifts to the fetal liver where definitive erythroid cells express adult beta globins ( beta major and minor ) [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">The epsilony gene is silenced in definitive erythroid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">The mechanism of silencing of its human counterpart , epsilon globin , has been studied extensively .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">In definitive erythropoiesis , epsilon is activated and silenced autonomously [ 24,25 ] , although in primitive erythropoiesis epsilon also <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">appears</cue> to be regulated competitively [ 26 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">The gamma-globin to adult beta-globin switch is controlled by promoter competition for the LCR [ 24,25 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">All the elements responsible for silencing the epsilon globin gene are within the epsilon gene or in adjacent sequences [ 27 ] , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that silencing is primarily gene autonomous</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">Using promoter deletion analyses in transgenic mouse models and cell transfection assays , multiple DNA elements important to the silencing process have been previously identified in both the proximal and the distal epsilon gene promoter [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">Their corresponding transcription factors , such as GATA-1 , YY-1 , COUP-TF , and DRED have been identified and shown to directly bind to these DNA elements ( as part of protein complexes ) to regulate epsilon silencing [ 27 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">Thus , it <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">appears</cue> that the silencing of the epsilon gene involves a complicated network of multiple cis elements and transacting proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">In addition to playing an important role in the development of the central nervous system [ 8-11 ] , cartilage [ 6,12,13 ] , and muscle [ 14,15 ] , it was shown that Sox6 is upregulated in long-term hematopoiesis stem cells ( LT-HSC ) compared with multipotent progenitors of adult mouse bone marrow lineage [ 28 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">In this study , we describe that Sox6 also exerts pleiotropic effects on erythropoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="30">These effects include delayed maturation of erythrocytes ( that normally enucleate prior to entering the bloodstream [ 27 ] ) and higher expression of embryonic globin genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="31">The most extreme effect is the persistence of high expression of the embryonic epsilony globin gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="32">Here we describe and characterize the effects of Sox6 on the epsilony globin gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="33">We show that Sox6 binds to the proximal promoter of epsilony globin and represses its transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="34">In wild-type ( WT ) mice , Sox6 is <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> expressed in yolk sac blood islands</scope> , but is expressed in fetal liver , the opposite expression pattern of epsilony globin .</sentence>
<sentence id="35">In the <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">absence</cue> of Sox6</scope> , epsilony globin is ectopically expressed in the fetal liver , demonstrating that Sox6 functions in definitive erythropoiesis .</sentence>
