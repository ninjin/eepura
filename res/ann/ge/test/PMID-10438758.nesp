<sentence id="0">The Legionella pneumophila rpoS gene is required for growth within Acanthamoeba castellanii .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To investigate regulatory networks in Legionella pneumophila , the gene encoding the homolog of the Escherichia coli stress and stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS was identified by complementation of an E. coli rpoS mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">An open reading frame that is approximately 60 % identical to the E. coli rpoS gene was identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Western blot analysis showed that the level of L. pneumophila RpoS increased in stationary phase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">An insertion mutation was constructed in the rpoS gene on the chromosome of L. pneumophila , and the ability of this mutant strain to survive various stress conditions was assayed and compared with results for the wild-type strain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both the mutant and wild-type strains were more resistant to stress when in stationary phase than when in the logarithmic phase of growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This finding <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates that</cue> <scope type="neg" id="0">L. pneumophila RpoS is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for a stationary-phase-dependent resistance to stress</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Although the mutant strain was able to kill HL-60- and THP-1-derived macrophages , it <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">could not</cue> replicate within a protozoan host , Acanthamoeba castellanii</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that L. pneumophila possesses a growth phase-dependent resistance to stress that is independent of RpoS control and that RpoS <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">likely</cue> regulates genes that enable it to survive in the environment within protozoa</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> the role of rpoS in L. pneumophila is very different from what has previously been reported for E. coli rpoS</scope> .</sentence>
