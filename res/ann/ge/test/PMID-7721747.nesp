<sentence id="0">Functional roles of in vivo footprinted DNA motifs within an alpha-globin enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Erythroid lineage and developmental stage specificities .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transcriptional regulation of the human alpha-like globin genes , embryonic zeta 2 and adult alpha , during erythroid development is mediated by a distal enhancer , HS-40 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Previous protein-DNA binding studies have shown that HS-40 consists of multiple nuclear factor binding motifs that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these factor binding motifs of HS-40 by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in erythroid cell cultures .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Three of these HS-40 enhancer motifs , 5'NF-E2/AP1 , GT II , and GATA-1(c) , positively regulate the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in embryonic/fetal erythroid K562 cells and the adult alpha-globin promoter activity in adult erythroid MEL cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the other hand , the 3'NF-E2/AP1 motif is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> this dual function <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be modulated through differential binding of the ubiquitous AP1 factors and the erythroid-enriched NF-E2 factor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Mutation in the GATA-1(d) motif , which exhibits an adult erythroid-specific genomic footprint , decreases the HS-40 enhancer function in dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cells but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in K562 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different HS-40 motifs .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The remarkable correlation between genomic footprinting data and the mutagenesis results also <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that the erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific regulation of human alpha-like globin promoters is indeed modulated by stable binding of specific nuclear factors in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
