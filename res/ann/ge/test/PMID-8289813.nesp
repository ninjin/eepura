<sentence id="0">Human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax associates with and is negatively regulated by the NF-kappa B2 p100 gene product : implications for viral latency .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiologic agent of the adult T-cell leukemia , an aggressive and often fatal malignancy of activated human CD4 T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HTLV-I encodes an essential 40-kDa protein termed Tax that not only transactivates the long terminal repeat of this retrovirus but also induces an array of cellular genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Tax-mediated transformation of T cells <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> involves the deregulated expression of various cellular genes that normally regulate lymphocyte growth produced by altered activity of various endogenous host transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In particular , Tax is capable of modulating the expression or activity of various host transcription factors , including members of the NF-kappa B/Rel and CREB/ATF families , as well as the cellular factors HEB-1 and p67SRF .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">An additional distinguishing characteristic of HTLV-I infection is the profound state of viral latency that is present in circulating primary leukemic T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In this study , we demonstrate that HTLV-I Tax can physically associate with p100 , the product of the Rel-related NF-kappa B2 gene , both in transfected cells and in HTLV-I-infected leukemic T-cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , the physical interaction of Tax with p100 leads to the inhibition of Tax-induced activation of the HTLV-I and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeats , reflecting p100-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration of the normally nuclearly expressed Tax protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , a mutant of Tax that selectively fails to activate nuclear NF-kappa B expression does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> associate with p100</scope> .</sentence>
