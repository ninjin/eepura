<sentence id="0">Grf40 , A novel Grb2 family member , is involved in T cell signaling through interaction with SLP-76 and LAT .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We molecularly cloned a new Grb2 family member , named Grf40 , containing the common SH3-SH2-SH3 motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Expression of Grf40 is predominant in hematopoietic cells , particularly T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Grf40 binds to the SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD ( SLP-76 ) via its SH3 domain more tightly than Grb2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Incidentally , Grf40 binds to linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> via its SH2 domain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Overexpression of wild-type Grf40 in Jurkat cells induced a significant increase of SLP-76-dependent interleukin (IL)-2 promoter and nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NF-AT ) activation upon T cell receptor ( TCR ) stimulation , whereas the COOH-terminal SH3-deleted Grf40 mutant <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacked</cue> any recognizable increase in IL-2 promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the SH2-deleted Grf40 mutant led to a marked inhibition of these regulatory activities , the effect of which is apparently stronger than that of the SH2-deleted Grb2 mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that Grf40 is an adaptor molecule involved in TCR-mediated signaling through a more efficient interaction than Grb2 with SLP-76 and LAT</scope> .</sentence>
