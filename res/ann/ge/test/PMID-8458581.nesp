<sentence id="0">p105 and p98 precursor proteins play an active role in NF-kappa B-mediated signal transduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Rel/NF-kappa B family of transcription factors is composed of two distinct subgroups , proteins that undergo proteolytic processing and contain SWI6/ankyrin repeats in their carboxyl termini ( p105 , p98 ) , and those <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> such repeats</scope> that do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> require processing ( p65 , c-Rel , RelB , and Dorsal )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate that the p105 and p98 precursors share functional properties with the I kappa B proteins , which also contain SWI6/ankyrin repeats .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both p105 and p98 were found to form stable complexes with other Rel/NF-kappa B family members , including p65 and c-Rel .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Association with the precursors is sufficient for cytoplasmic retention of either p65 or c-Rel , both of which are otherwise nuclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These complexes undergo stimulus-responsive processing to produce active p50/c-Rel and p55/c-Rel complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a second pathway leading to NF-kappa B induction , in which processing of the precursors <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">rather than</cue> phosphorylation of I kappa B</scope> plays a major role</scope> .</sentence>
