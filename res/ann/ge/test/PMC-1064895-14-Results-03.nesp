<sentence id="0">Regulation of IL-17 production in RA PBMC by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Because RA PBMC include several cell types in addition to T cells , some inflammatory cytokines released from macrophages and other lymphocytes <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> have affected the production of IL-17 from T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To evaluate the effects of inflammatory cytokines released by activated PBMC , we tested the effects of several cytokines and chemokines on IL-17 production .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We detected an increase in IL-17 level after stimulation with IL-15 ( 10 ng/ml ) , whereas with IL-1beta ( 10 ng/ml ) , TNF-alpha ( 10 ng/ml ) , IL-18 ( 10 ng/ml ) or TGF-beta ( 10 ng/ml ) the levels in IL-17 were unchanged ( Fig .</sentence>
