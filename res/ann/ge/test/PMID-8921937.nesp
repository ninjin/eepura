<sentence id="0">Differential nuclear localization of p50 , p52 , and RelB proteins in human accessory cells of the immune response in situ .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Rel/NF-kappa B proteins , p50 , p52 , p65 , c-Rel , and RelB , constitute a family of transcription factors involved in the positive regulation of a variety of genes during the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recently , it has been shown that RelB knockout mice have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> dendritic cells ( DC )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An overexpression of p50 has been described in follicular dendritic cells ( FDC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A constitutive NF-kappa B activity has been reported in mature macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This led to the hypothesis that some of the Rel/NF-kappa B proteins were key nuclear factors in functions of accessory cells of the immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , we investigated in situ the nuclear localization of Rel/NF-kappa B proteins in accessory cells of the immune system by immunohistochemistry and double labeling by immunofluorescence from five normal human tonsils and five lymph nodes with follicular hyperplasia .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Nuclear p65 and c-Rel proteins were found in all cell types including lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In germinal centers GC , p50 , p52 , and RelB were found in the nuclei of FDC only and <scope type="neg" id="1">were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> detected in the nuclei of CD68+ cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In T cell areas , p50 , p52 , and RelB were found in the nuclei of HLA-DR+ cells with an antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) morphology .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">p52 and RelB were detected in the nuclei in both CD1a+ and CD68+ cells from the T cell area , whereas p50 was found only in CD68- and CD1a- cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Cells with nuclear p50 were <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">negative</cue> for the CD38 , CD20 and CD2 markers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These results show that , physiologically , high levels of nuclear of p50 , p52 and RelB are restricted to accessory cells of the immune system , which include FDC in GC , and DC and macrophages in the T cell zone , that specialized scavenger macrophages from GC do <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> have detectable levels of p52 and RelB</scope> , whereas macrophages from the T cell area , known to present the antigen to T cells , do have both nuclear p52 and RelB , and that in the T cell zone , p52 and RelB are located in nuclei of both CD1a+ , CD68+ or both , cells APC , whereas p50 is restricted to CD1a- and CD68- APC .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The different patterns of p50 , p52 and RelB protein nuclear localization <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> provide insight into their different roles during the immune response in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
