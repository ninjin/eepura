<sentence id="0">Sp1 functions in a chromatin-dependent manner to augment human alpha-globin promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The 5' flanking region of the human alpha-globin gene is highly G + C rich and contains multiple copies of the consensus sequence for the Sp1 binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the role of this G + C-rich region in augmenting alpha-globin promoter activity in the presence of the far-upstream alpha-globin enhancer , HS-40 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that in transiently transfected erythroid cells , deletion of the alpha-globin G + C-rich 5' flanking region has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on alpha-globin promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , upon stable integration into chromatin , deletion of this region causes a nearly 90 % decrease in promoter activity compared with expression from an alpha-globin promoter retaining this region .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the alpha-globin G + C-rich 5' flanking region augments alpha-globin promoter activity in a chromatin-dependent manner</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We further show that this G + C-rich region is required for the activation of alpha-globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , we show by both footprint analysis and functional assays that the ability of the G + C-rich region to increase alpha-globin promoter activity from a stably integrated alpha-globin gene is mediated by its multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 .</sentence>
