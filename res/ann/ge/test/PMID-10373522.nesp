<sentence id="0">p70(s6k) integrates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and rapamycin-regulated signals for E2F regulation in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In T lymphocytes , the hematopoietic cytokine interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) uses phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) -induced signaling pathways to regulate E2F transcriptional activity , a critical cell cycle checkpoint .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PI 3-kinase also regulates the activity of p70(s6k) , the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase , a response that is abrogated by the macrolide rapamycin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This immunosuppressive drug is known to prevent T-cell proliferation , but the precise point at which rapamycin regulates T-cell cycle progression has yet to be elucidated .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , the effects of rapamycin on , and the role of p70(s6k) in , IL-2 and PI 3-kinase activation of E2Fs have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been characterized</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our present results show that IL-2- and PI 3-kinase-induced pathways for the regulation of E2F transcriptional activity include both rapamycin-resistant and rapamycin-sensitive components .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70(s6k) in T cells could restore rapamycin-suppressed E2F responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the rapamycin-controlled processes involved in E2F regulation <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to be mediated by p70(s6k)</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , the rapamycin-resistant p70(s6k) <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">could not</cue> rescue rapamycin inhibition of T-cell cycle entry</scope> , consistent with the involvement of additional , rapamycin-sensitive pathways in the control of T-cell cycle progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The present results thus show that p70(s6k) is able to regulate E2F transcriptional activity and provide direct evidence for the first time for a link between IL-2 receptors , PI 3-kinase , and p70(s6k) that regulates a crucial G1 checkpoint in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
