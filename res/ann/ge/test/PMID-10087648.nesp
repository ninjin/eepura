<sentence id="0">T helper differentiation proceeds through Stat1-dependent , Stat4-dependent and Stat4-independent phases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Much of our focus in understanding Th1/Th2 development has been on the signals delivered by IL-12 and IL-4 as final determinants of terminal T cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because extinction of IL-12 signaling in early Th2 development could <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> be important in imprinting a more permanent Th2 phenotype on a population of T cells</scope> , we have also examined various parameters regulating the IL-12 signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Whereas <scope type="spec" id="1"> IL-4 <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to repress functional IL-12 signaling through inhibition of IL-12R beta 2 expression</scope> , IFN-gamma in the mouse , and IFN-alpha in the human <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to induce IL-12R beta 2 expression and promote IL-12 responsiveness</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that Th1 development can be considered in two stages , capacitance and development</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Capacitance <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">would</cue> simply involve expression of IL-12R beta 1 and beta 2 subunits , regulated by TCR , IL-4 and IFNs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The second stage , development , we <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">propose</cue> is the true IL-12 induced developmental stage , involving expression of Stat4 inducible proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the human , this <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> also occur via IFN-alpha , which is able to activate Stat4</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It is <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">perhaps</cue> <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">possible</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="9"> all of Stat4 actions on Th1 development <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> be exert directly by Stat4 at the IFN-gamma gene</scope></scope></scope> , however we <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">suggest</cue> that , more <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">likely</cue> , Stat4 <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">may</cue> act to induce Th1 development through the induction of other non-cytokine genes , whose stable expression maintains the transcriptional state of a Th1 cell</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
