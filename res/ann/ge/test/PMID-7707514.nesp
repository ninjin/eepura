<sentence id="0">Transcriptional activity of core binding factor-alpha ( AML1 ) and beta subunits on murine leukemia virus enhancer cores .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Core binding factor ( CBF ) , also known as polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 and SL3 enhancer factor 1 , is a mammalian transcription factor that binds to an element termed the core within the enhancers of the murine leukemia virus family of retroviruses .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The core elements of the SL3 virus are important genetic determinants of the ability of this virus to induce T-cell lymphomas and the transcriptional activity of the viral long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">CBF consists of two subunits , a DNA binding subunit , CBF alpha , and a second subunit , CBF beta , that stimulates the DNA binding activity of CBF alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One of the genes that encodes a CBF alpha subunit is AML1 , also called Cbf alpha 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This locus is rearranged by chromosomal translocations in human myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">An exogenously expressed Cbf alpha 2-encoded subunit ( CBF alpha 2-451 ) stimulated transcription from the SL3 enhancer in P19 and HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Activity was mediated through the core elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Three different isoforms of CBF beta were also tested for transcriptional activity on the SL3 enhancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The longest form , CBF beta-187 , increased the transcriptional stimulation by CBF alpha 2-451 twofold in HeLa cells , although it had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect in P19 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Transcriptional activation by CBF beta required binding to the CBF alpha subunit , as a form of CBF beta that <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacked</cue> binding ability , CBF beta-148</scope> , failed to increase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> at least in certain cell types , the maximum activity of CBF required both subunits</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">They also provided support for the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesis</cue> that CBF is a factor in T lymphocytes that is responsible for recognition of the SL3 cores</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">We also examined <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">whether</cue> CBF <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> distinguish a 1-bp difference between the enhancer core of SL3 and the core of the nonleukemogenic virus</scope></scope> , Akv. This difference strongly affects transcription in T cells and leukemogenicity of SL3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">However , <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> combination of CBF alpha and CBF beta subunits that we tested</scope> was able to distinguish the 1-bp difference in transcription assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Thus , a complete understanding of how T cells recognize the SL3 core remains to be elucidated .</sentence>
