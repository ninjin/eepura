<sentence id="0">Two glucocorticoid binding sites on the human glucocorticoid receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoids are known to have a lytic effect in leukemic cells via interactions with the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Cortisol and various synthetic glucocorticoids bind to the GR with one-site kinetics .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cortivazol ( CVZ ) is a unique , high potency synthetic glucocorticoid , which has a phenylpyrazol fused to the A-ring of the steroid nucleus and displays binding consistent with two or more sites in the cytosol from CEM C7 cells ( a human acute lymphoblastic T-cell line ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It has previously been shown that the lower affinity class of sites are similar in affinity and site molarity to those recognized by dexamethasone .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The higher affinity sites bind CVZ with 20- to 50-fold greater affinity , consistent with CVZ 's enhanced biological effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In mutant leukemic cells resistant to the lytic effects of dexamethasone , CVZ both lyses the cells and recognizes a single class of sites similar to the high affinity site in CEM C7 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We have carried out experiments to define the nature of the higher affinity CVZ binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We now show that : 1 ) CVZ has more than one binding site in a second , independent , B-cell line , IM-9 ; 2 ) the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 is able to block both CVZ 's higher and lower affinity sites ; 3 ) all of CVZ 's binding sites are on a protein immunologically indistinguishable from the human GR ; and 4 ) freshly isolated clones of CVZ-resistant cells have lost all binding sites for CVZ .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> CVZ is recognizing two glucocorticoid binding sites on the human GR <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> a protein very similar to it</scope></scope> .</sentence>
