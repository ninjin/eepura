<sentence id="0">The c-rel protooncogene product represses NF-kappa B p65-mediated transcriptional activation of the long terminal repeat of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) and the 5' regulatory region of the gene encoding the interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit ( IL-2R alpha ) share functional kappa B enhancer elements involved in the regulation of these inducible transcription units during T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These kappa B enhancer elements are recognized by a structurally related family of interactive proteins that includes p50 , p65 , and the product of the c-rel protooncogene ( c-Rel ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recent biochemical studies have shown that p65 and p50 form the prototypical NF-kappa B complex , which is rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This intracellular signaling complex potently stimulates kappa B-directed transcription from <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">either</cue> the HIV-1 LTR or the IL-2R alpha promoter</scope> via the strong transactivation domain present in p65 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We now demonstrate that nuclear expression of human c-Rel , which is induced by either phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha with delayed kinetics relative to p65 , markedly represses p65-mediated activation of these transcription units .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These inhibitory effects of c-Rel correlate with its DNA-binding activity but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> with its ability to heterodimerize with p50</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that c-Rel inhibition involves competition with p50/p65 for occupancy of the kappa B enhancer element</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that one function of c-Rel is as a physiologic repressor of the HIV-1 LTR and IL-2R alpha promoters , serving to efficiently counter the strong transcriptional activating effects of p65</scope> .</sentence>
