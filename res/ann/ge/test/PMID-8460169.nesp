<sentence id="0">Mutual regulation of the transcriptional activator NF-kappa B and its inhibitor , I kappa B-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The NK-kappa B transcription factor complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein I kappa B-alpha ( MAD-3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Various cellular stimuli relieve this inhibition by mechanisms largely unknown , leading to NF-kappa B nuclear localization and transactivation of its target genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It is demonstrated here with human T lymphocytes and monocytes that different stimuli , including tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , cause rapid degradation of I kappa B-alpha , with concomitant activation of NF-kappa B , followed by a dramatic increase in I kappa B-alpha mRNA and protein synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transfection studies reveal that the I kappa B-alpha mRNA and the encoded protein are potently induced by NF-kappa B and by homodimers of p65 and of c-Rel .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> a model in which NF-kappa B and I kappa B-alpha mutually regulate each other in a cycle : saturating amounts of the inhibitory I kappa B-alpha protein are destroyed upon stimulation</scope> , allowing rapid activation of NF-kappa B. Subsequently , I kappa B-alpha mRNA and protein levels are quickly induced by the activated NF-kappa B. This resurgence of I kappa B-alpha protein acts to restore an equilibrium in which NF-kappa B is again inhibited .</sentence>
