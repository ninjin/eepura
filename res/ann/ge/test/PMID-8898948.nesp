<sentence id="0">Tyrosine kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activities in CD40-activated human B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In vitro , human B lymphocytes undergo long-term proliferation when activated through CD40 , a protein expressed on their cell surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The nature of CD40-dependent signals in proliferating fresh human Epstein-Barr virus-negative B lymphocytes is currently unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , a CD40-dependent B cell culture system was used to examine the role of different signal transduction elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Protein kinase C ( PKC ) depletion generated by a long-term phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate treatment had weak effects on proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Rather , tyrosine phosphorylation was shown to be directly involved in mediating CD40-dependent signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The use of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)-specific inhibitor herbimycin A dramatically decreased cellular proliferation <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> altering the activity of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat ( HIV-1 LTR )</scope> , a promoter largely dependent on the binding of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF- kappa B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , the cAMP-dependent protein kinase specific inhibitor H-89 totally inhibited HIV-1 LTR activity at a concentration as low as 100 nM <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> affecting cellular proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and supershift assay using an NF-kappa B binding sequence from the kappa light chain as a probe , revealed that both p65 ( RelA ) and c-Rel were present in CD40-stimulated B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">While PKC depletion did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> alter the NF-kappa B level</scope> , treatment of B lymphocytes with H-89 or herbimycin A provoked a decrease in the NF-kappa B level .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These observations establish the importance of different signal transducing pathways leading to CD40 activation of B lymphocytes .</sentence>
