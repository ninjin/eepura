<sentence id="0">Induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 by low-density lipoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">When endothelial cells are incubated with this lipoprotein in pathophysiologic amounts , the cells are activated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Among the documented cellular responses to LDL is increased recruitment of monocytes , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which are <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to play a major role in promoting intimal plaque formation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The findings presented here link an atheogenic lipoprotein , LDL , with the induction of an adhesion molecule important in atherogenesis Human LDL induces the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) transcriptionally with an increase in mRNA levels through activation of the VCAM promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This effect is blocked by anti-VCAM antibodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">After a 2-day incubation in LDL , the binding of NF-kappa B , <scope type="spec" id="1"> which is <cue type="spec" id="1">believed</cue> to be a key oxidative-stress sensor for VCAM regulation</scope> , remains at basal level .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , the binding activities of AP-1 and GATA , on the other hand , are increased by LDL .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , a component of LDL-enhanced endothelial recruitment of monocytes is attributed to VCAM-1 expression , <scope type="spec" id="2"> which <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to be mediated through AP-1 and GATA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data identify LDL as a VCAM-inducer <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibly</cue> distinct from cytokines and endotoxin</scope> .</sentence>
