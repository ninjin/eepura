<sentence id="0">Multiple NF-ATc isoforms with individual transcriptional properties are synthesized in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcription factor NF-ATc that controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and embryonic cardiac cells is expressed in three prominent isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This is due to alternative splice/polyadenylation events that lead to the predominant synthesis of two long isoforms in naive T cells and a shorter NF-ATc isoform in effector T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Whereas the previously described isoform NF-ATc/A contains a relatively short C terminus , the longer isoforms , B and C , span extra C-terminal peptides of 128 and 246 aa , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show here that in addition to the strong N-terminal trans-activation domain , TAD-A , which is common to all three NF-ATc isoforms , NF-ATc/C contains a second trans-activation domain , TAD-B , in its C-terminal peptide .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Various stimuli of T cells that induce the activity of TAD-A also enhance the activity of TAD-B , but , unlike TAD-A , TAD-B remains unphosphorylated by protein from 12-O-tetradecanoyl 12-phorbol 13-acetate-stimulated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The shorter C-terminal peptide of isoform NF-ATc/B exerts a suppressive transcriptional effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These properties of NF-ATc/B and -C <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> be of importance for gene regulation in naive T lymphocytes in which NF-ATc/B and -C are predominantly synthesized</scope> .</sentence>
