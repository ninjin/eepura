<sentence id="0">Activation of the HIV-1 enhancer by the LEF-1 HMG protein on nucleosome-assembled DNA in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 ( LEF-1 ) is a regulatory high mobility group ( HMG ) protein that activates the T cell receptor alpha ( TCR alpha ) enhancer in a context-restricted manner in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this paper we demonstrate that the distal region of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) enhancer , which contains DNA-binding sites for LEF-1 and Ets-1 , also provides a functional context for activation by LEF-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">First , we show that mutations in the LEF-1-binding site inhibit the activity of multimerized copies of the HIV-1 enhancer in Jurkat T cells , and that LEF-1/GAL4 can activate a GAL4-substituted HIV-1 enhancer 80- to 100-fold in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Second , recombinant LEF-1 is shown to activate HIV-1 transcription on chromatin-assembled DNA in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By using a nucleosome-assembly system derived from Drosophila embryos , we find that the packaging of DNA into chromatin in vitro strongly represses HIV-1 transcription and that repression can be counteracted efficiently by preincubation of the DNA with LEF-1 ( or LEF-1 and Ets-1 ) supplemented with fractions containing the promoter-binding protein , Sp1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Addition of TFE-3 , which binds to an E-box motif upstream of the LEF-1 and Ets-1 sites , further augments transcription in this system .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Individually or collectively , none of the three enhancer-binding proteins ( LEF-1 , Ets-1 , and TFE-3 ) could activate transcription in the absence of Sp1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A truncation mutant of LEF-1 ( HMG-88 ) , which contains the HMG box but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> the trans-activation domain</scope> , did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> activate transcription from nucleosomal DNA</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> bending of DNA by the HMG domain is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> sufficient to activate transcription in vitro</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We conclude that transcription activation by LEF-1 in vitro is a chromatin-dependent process that requires a functional trans-activation domain in addition to the HMG domain .</sentence>
