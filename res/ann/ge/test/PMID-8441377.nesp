<sentence id="0">Dimerization of NF-KB2 with RelA(p65) regulates DNA binding , transcriptional activation , and inhibition by an I kappa B-alpha ( MAD-3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inducible expression of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is regulated by a cellular transcription factor , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">NF-kappa B is composed of distinct subunits ; five independent genes , NFKB1(p105) , NFKB2(p100) , RelA(p65) , c-rel and relB , that encode related proteins that bind to kappa B DNA elements have been isolated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have previously found that NFKB2(p49/p52) acts in concert with RelA(p65) to stimulate the HIV enhancer in Jurkat T-leukemia cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we examine the biochemical basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIV by NFKB2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using Scatchard analysis , we have determined the dissociation constants of homodimeric p49 and heterodimeric p49/p65 for binding to the HIV kappa B site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">p49 has a approximately 18-fold-lower affinity for the HIV kappa B site ( KD = 69.1 pM ) than does the approximately 50-kDa protein NFKB1(p50) derived from p105 ( KD = 3.9 pM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , the affinity of heterodimeric NFKB2(p49)/RelA(p65) for this site is approximately 6-fold higher ( KD = 11.8 pM ) than that of p49 alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Consistent with these findings , in vitro transcription was stimulated 18-fold by the addition of preformed , heterodimeric NFKB2(p49)/RelA(p65) protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer was also subject to regulation by recently cloned I kappa B-alpha(MAD-3) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Recombinant I kappa B-alpha(MAD-3) inhibited the DNA binding activity of p65 , p49/p65 , and p50/p65 but stimulated the binding of NFKB2(p49) or NFKB1(p50) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Functional activation of an HIV reporter plasmid by p49/p65 in transiently transfected Jurkat T-leukemia cells was also inhibited by coexpression of MAD-3 .</sentence>
