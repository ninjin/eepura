<sentence id="0">Association of the interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain with p47phox , an activator of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin (IL)-4 plays an important role in IgE synthesis in B cells and in Th2 differentiation in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">IL-4 conducts its biological activities through binding to the IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) on the surface of target cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> IL-4R are <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be composed of the IL-4R alpha chain ( IL-4R alpha ) and either the IL-2R gamma chain or the IL-13R alpha chain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have previously shown that the membrane-proximal portion in the cytoplasmic domain of the human IL-4R alpha ( hIL-4R alpha ) is critical for proliferation , generation of germline epsilon transcript , and activation of STAT6 , based on analyses of truncated hIL-4R alphas .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we found that p47phox , an activator of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase , binds to this portion by the two-hybrid system .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we observed the association of p47phox with the hIL-4R alpha in B cells derived from a normal donor .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that p47phox is involved in the signal transduction of IL-4 in B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , <scope type="neg" id="2">activation of STAT6 , CD23 expression , and IgE synthesis induced by IL-4 were <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected in p47phox-deficient patients</scope> , which <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">raises the</cue> possibility that p47phox <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be important in other signaling activities as well in B cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
