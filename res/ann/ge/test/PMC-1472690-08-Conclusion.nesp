<sentence id="0">Conclusion</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In summary , our data demonstrated that in vitro glucan phosphate induced a transcription factor binding and a subsequent cytokine profile different from LPS and also from TSST-1 and , moreover , switched a pro-inflammatory TSST-1-induced response to an IL-1RA-mediated anti-inflammatory reaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Our results also generated new insights into a very complex interplay of transcription factor binding to various known and newly identified sites in the IL-1RA promoter ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">8 ) , which can be regulated differentially by a fungal carbohydrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Together with the in vivo studies [ 22,37 ] , our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> support the concept of protective effects mediated by glucan phosphate in pro-inflammatory conditions , especially with a dysregulated IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio [ 52,53 ]</scope> .</sentence>
