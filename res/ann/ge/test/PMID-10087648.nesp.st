E1001	Speculation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 1316 1507	suggest that, more likely, Stat4 may act to induce Th1 development through the induction of other non-cytokine genes, whose stable expression maintains the transcriptional state of a Th1 cell

E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1349 1507	may act to induce Th1 development through the induction of other non-cytokine genes, whose stable expression maintains the transcriptional state of a Th1 cell
T1006	Speculation 532 539	appears
E1003	Speculation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 527 624	IL-4 appears to repress functional IL-12 signaling through inhibition of IL-12R beta 2 expression

T1010	Speculation 756 763	propose
E1005	Speculation:T1010 Scope:T1011
T1011	Span 756 845	propose that Th1 development can be considered in two stages, capacitance and development

E1006	Speculation:T1012 Scope:T1013
T1013	Span 677 751	appear to induce IL-12R beta 2 expression and promote IL-12 responsiveness

E1007	Speculation:T1014 Scope:T1015
T1015	Span 996 1099	propose is the true IL-12 induced developmental stage, involving expression of Stat4 inducible proteins
T1016	Speculation 859 864	would
E1008	Speculation:T1016 Scope:T1017
T1017	Span 859 960	would simply involve expression of IL-12R beta 1 and beta 2 subunits, regulated by TCR, IL-4 and IFNs

E1009	Speculation:T1018 Scope:T1019
T1019	Span 1189 1303	perhaps possible that all of Stat4 actions on Th1 development may be exert directly by Stat4 at the IFN-gamma gene

E1010	Speculation:T1020 Scope:T1021
T1021	Span 1120 1181	may also occur via IFN-alpha, which is able to activate Stat4
