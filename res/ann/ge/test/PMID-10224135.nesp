<sentence id="0">Differential inhibition of Smad6 and Smad7 on bone morphogenetic protein- and activin-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Smad6 and Smad7 prevent ligand-induced activation of signal-transducing Smad proteins in the transforming growth factor-beta family .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we demonstrate that both Smad6 and Smad7 are human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (hBMP-2)-inducible antagonists of hBMP-2-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , we confirmed that the ectopic expressions of Smad6 and Smad7 inhibited the hBMP-2-induced Smad1/Smad5 phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We previously reported that Smad7 is an activin A-inducible antagonist of activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in HS-72 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , although mRNA expression of Smad6 was induced by activin A in HS-72 cells , Smad6 showed <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> antagonistic effect on activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , we found that the ectopic expression of Smad7 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> Smad6</scope> , inhibited the activin A-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in HS-72 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , Smad6 and Smad7 exhibit differential inhibitory effects in bone morphogenetic protein-2- and activin A-mediated signaling in B lineage cells .</sentence>
