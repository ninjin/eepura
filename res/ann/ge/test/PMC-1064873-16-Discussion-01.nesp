<sentence id="0">CD4+ T cells orchestrate the Th1-type cell-mediated immune response in RA [ 22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activated CD4+ T cells stimulate macrophages , synovial fibroblasts , B cells , and osteoclasts through the expression of cell surface molecules and Th1 cytokines , thereby contributing to both the chronic inflammation and the joint destruction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CD4+ T cells require two signals to be activated ; antigen receptor occupancy and CD28-mediated costimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the ST lesion , the CD28 ligands , both CD80 and CD86 , together with MHC class II antigens , are substantially expressed by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells [ 18-20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The significance of CD28 engagement in the T-cell-mediated disease process has recently been proven by the clinical efficacy of its blocker cytotoxic T-cell-associated antigen 4 (CD152)-IgG in RA patients [ 23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-10 plays a predominant role in limiting immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the function of both macrophages and Th1 cells [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">IL-10 inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 molecule and the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding in T cells , and thereby directly acts on T cells [ 24 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the present study , we found that PB CD4+ T cells from patients with active RA , in the presence of IL-10 , are able to produce higher levels of IFN-gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation than normal CD4+ T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Despite high-level IL-10R1 expression and constitutive STAT3 activation , IL-10-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is suppressed in RA CD4+ T cells , in contrast to normal CD4+ T cells , where STAT3 phosphorylation is dose-dependently inducible by IL-10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Serum IL-6 from RA patients induces STAT3 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> STAT1 phosphorylation</scope> in normal CD4+ T cells , and exogenous IL-6 induces the resistance to IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma production .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">RA CD4+ T cells contain higher levels of SOCS1 but contain lower levels of SOCS3 transcripts in comparison with normal CD4+ T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> CD4+ T cells become resistant to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 before migration into the inflamed ST , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that this resistance <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be attributable to impaired IL-10-dependent STAT3 activation , in association with sustained STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS1 induction</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">IL-10-mediated inhibition of CD4+ T-cell cytokine production is principally dependent on its inhibition of macrophage antigen-presenting cell function [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">However , this indirect inhibitory effect is <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">thought</cue> to be restricted at the site of T-cell activation in RA</scope> , because macrophages in the ST express high levels of cytokines , CD80 and CD86 molecules , and MHC class II antigens [ 10,18-20 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">More recently , IL-10 has been shown to induce the antigen-specific T-cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting CD28 tyrosine phosphorylation [ 33 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15"><scope type="spec" id="5"> This direct effect also <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be limited in active RA patients</scope> , because their PB CD4+ T cells showed a defective IL-10 inhibition of CD28-costimulated production of both IFN-gamma and IL-2 .</sentence>
