<sentence id="0">SOCS-3 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to interleukin-2 and suppresses STAT5 phosphorylation and lymphocyte proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Members of the recently discovered SOCS/CIS/SSI family have been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">proposed</cue> as regulators of cytokine signaling</scope> , and while <scope type="spec" id="1"> targets and mechanisms have been <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> for some family members</scope> , the precise role of these proteins remains to be defined .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To date <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> SOCS proteins</scope> have been specifically implicated in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) signaling in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report SOCS-3 expression in response to IL-2 in both T-cell lines and human peripheral blood lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">SOCS-3 protein was detectable as early as 30 min following IL-2 stimulation , while CIS was seen only at low levels after 2 h. Unlike CIS , SOCS-3 was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was observed upon coexpression with Jak1 and Jak2 but only weakly with Jak3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In these experiments , SOCS-3 associated with Jak1 and inhibited Jak1 phosphorylation , and this inhibition was markedly enhanced by the presence of IL-2 receptor beta chain ( IL-2Rbeta ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , following IL-2 stimulation of T cells , SOCS-3 was able to interact with the IL-2 receptor complex , and in particular tyrosine phosphorylated Jak1 and IL-2Rbeta .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Additionally , in lymphocytes expressing SOCS-3 but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> CIS</scope> , IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b was markedly reduced , while there was only a weak effect on IL-3-mediated STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Finally , proliferation induced by both IL-2- and IL-3 was significantly inhibited in the presence of SOCS-3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that when SOCS-3 is rapidly induced by IL-2 in T cells , it acts to inhibit IL-2 responses in a classical negative feedback loop</scope> .</sentence>
