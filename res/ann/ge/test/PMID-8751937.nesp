<sentence id="0">Activation of human monocytic cells by Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteins and synthetic lipopeptides proceeds via a pathway distinct from that of lipopolysaccharide but involves the transcriptional activator NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">There is increasing evidence that lipoproteins of Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi are key inflammatory mediators during syphilis and Lyme disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A principal objective of the present study was to identify more precisely similarities and divergences among lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and lipoprotein-lipopeptide-induced immune cell signaling events .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Like LPS , purified native B. burgdorferi OspA and synthetic analogs of OspA , OspB , and two T. pallidum lipoproteins ( Tpp47 and Tpp17 ) all induced NF-kappa B translocation in THP-1 human monocytoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Acylation of OspA and the synthetic peptides was requisite for cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Polymyxin B abrogated only the response to LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By using 70Z/3-derived pre-B-cell lines <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">either</cue> <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> or expressing human CD14 ( the LPS receptor</scope> )</scope> , it was observed that expression of human CD14 imparted responsiveness to LPS but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> to OspA or spirochetal lipopeptides</scope> ( assessed by induction of NF-kappa B and expression of surface immunoglobulin M ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , the biological relevance of the observation that T. pallidum lipoproteins-lipopeptides induce both NF-kappa B and cytokine production in monocytes was supported by the ability of the synthetic analogs to promote human immunodeficiency virus replication in chronically infected U1 monocytoid cells ; these observations also <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a potential mechanism whereby a syphilitic chancre <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">can</cue> serve as a cofactor for human immunodeficiency virus transmission</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The combined data lend additional support to the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">proposal</cue> that spirochetal lipoproteins and LPS initiate monocyte activation via different cell surface events but that the signaling pathways ultimately converge to produce qualitatively similar cellular responses</scope> .</sentence>
