<sentence id="0">Age-related decreases in IL-2 production by human T cells are associated with impaired activation of nuclear transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-AT .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although transcriptional factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) are important for the normal induction of IL-2 , it is unknown <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">if</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> the age-related decline in IL-2 production by activated human T cells <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be associated with aberrancies in transcriptional regulatory proteins</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the current studies , IL-2 production by T cells from elderly ( mean 78 years ) and young ( mean 37 years ) humans was measured in cultures stimulated with PHA , PHA plus PMA , crosslinked anti-CD3 mAB OKT3 plus PMA , or PMA plus ionomycin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Substantial decreases of IL-2 production were observed for cell cultures from 7 of 12 elderly individuals in response to the different stimuli , whereas the levels of IL-2 produced by stimulated T cells from other elderly individuals were equivalent to those observed for stimulated T cells of young subjects .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analyses of nuclear extracts by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays showed that decreased IL-2 production by stimulated T cells of elderly individuals was closely associated with impairments in the activation of both AP-1 and NF-AT .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By contrast , T cells from elderly subjects with normal levels of IL-2 production exhibited normal activation of AP-1 and NF-AT .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , the results of competition experiments analyzing the normal components of NF-AT showed that the age-related reductions in stimulus-dependent NF-AT complexes corresponded to the slow migrating complexes that were composed of c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The resting and stimulated levels of NF kappa B were reduced in T cells from certain elderly individuals ; however , alterations of NF kappa B did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> correlate with changes in IL-2 expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , these results show that age-related impairments in the activation of AP-1 and NF-AT are closely associated with decreased expression of IL-2 and further <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active c-Fos/c-Jun AP-1 <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> contribute to the impaired activation of NF-AT</scope></scope> .</sentence>
