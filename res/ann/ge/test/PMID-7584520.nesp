<sentence id="0">The DNA and steroid binding domains of the glucocorticoid receptor are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> altered in mononuclear cells of treated CLL patients</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The aim of this study was to investigate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> account for the increasing unresponsiveness of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) to combination chemotherapy</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The receptor was tested immunocytochemically , in steroid binding assays , and by a mutation screening ( denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ) of the receptor-cDNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The receptor concentration , as measured by staining and steroid binding test , varied considerably but showed <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> clear correlation to clinical response</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using a highly sensitive mutation screening assay of the DNA- and the steroid-binding region , none of the treated patients revealed any mutation , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that the glucocorticoid receptor in the CLL patients tested is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> altered in these domains</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In one individual who had <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> been treated before analysis</scope> a silent mutation was found in one receptor allele .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggest</cue> that mechanisms other than altered ligand or DNA binding of the receptor <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">may</cue> be responsible for the <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">lack</cue> of response to chemotherapy</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
