<sentence id="0">Expression of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase in human skin cancers : an immunohistochemical study .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression of nucleoside diphosphate(NDP) kinase , which is homologous to the nm23 gene product in a variety of species , has been found to be inversely associated with metastatic potential .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the relationship remains controversial according to the tumor cell types and experimental system , with conflicting results from different research groups .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> NDP kinase expression serves as a marker for metastatic potential in human skin cancer</scope> , we assessed the levels of NDP kinase expression in 9 keratoacanthomas ( KAs ) , 26 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) , and 25 basal cell carcinomas ( BCCs ) using immunohistochemistry .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The expression of NDP kinase was intense in KA and SCC compared with BCC .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the difference of NDP kinase expression between KA and SCC was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> statistically significant</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">And there was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> statistically significant difference in NDP kinase expression between SCC with metastasis and SCC <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> metastasis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results contradict the <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">hypothesis</cue> concerning the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possible</cue> role of nm23 gene as a metastatic suppressor gene in human skin cancer</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The mechanism of overexpression in various tumor cell types and its biological significance in cutaneous carcinogenesis remain to be determined .</sentence>
