<sentence id="0">EMSA and ChIP Assays Show that Sox6 Directly Binds to the epsilony Promoter</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Sox6 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> repress the epsilony promoter , either through direct physical contact with the promoter or by regulating intermediates affecting the epsilony promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> Sox6 is directly associated with the epsilony promoter</scope> , we first performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) using a c-Myc-tagged Sox6 in a reticulocyte lysate-based transcription/translation in vitro system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The probes used are listed in Figure 3A .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The 36-base pair ( bp ) WT probe corresponds to the critical region of the epsilony promoter defined in our promoter deletion analyses .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This probe contains two consensus Sox/Sox6 binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Also included in our EMSA are three mutated probes that are , either truncated ( M1 ) , or mutated ( M2 and M3 ) in Sox/Sox6 binding sites ( Figure 3A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Sox6 is able to physically associate with the 36-bp region ( Figure 3B ) within the epsilony promoter defined by the deletion analysis experiments ( Figure 2C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The 36-bp probe was shifted by the tagged Sox6 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Moreover , both c-Myc and Sox6 antibodies supershift the band , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> the binding is Sox6-specific</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">To rule out the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibility</cue> that the c-Myc tag itself binds to the probe</scope> , an HA-tagged Sox6 was used in another EMSA that confirmed these results ( Figure 3C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Next , nuclear extracts from MEL cells were used in EMSA employing the same 36-bp probe .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">MEL cells , a murine erythroleukemic cell line , express adult beta globins , but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> epsilony</scope> [ 33 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Sox6 directly binds to this DNA sequence in MEL cells ( Figure 3D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The intact consensus Sox/Sox6 binding sites of the DNA probe are required for the binding , as shown in the competition assay ( Figure 3E ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Ablation of <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">putative</cue> Sox/Sox6 binding sites ( M1 and M3</scope> ) abolish their ability to compete in EMSA ( Figure 3E ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">The M2 mutant probe <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> compete partially with WT binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">To investigate the functional significance of the intact Sox/Sox6 binding sites , the epsilony promoter reporter constructs with mutagenized Sox/Sox6 binding sites were co-transfected with the Sox6 overexpression vector into GM979 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Consistent with the EMSA results , the mutant epsilony promoter reporter constructs ( with either one or both Sox/Sox6 binding sites mutagenized ) do <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> result in significant promoter repression in transfection studies</scope> ( Figure 3F ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Thus , both sites are required for maximal repression of epsilony by Sox6 , but <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> to the same degree</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">We also tested <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">whether</cue> Sox6 binds to the epsilony promoter in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) ( Figure 4 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">The Sox6-containing complex was immunoprecipitated from MEL cells or from liver cells of 15.5 dpc WT mice using Sox6 antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">Figure 4 shows that the epsilony proximal promoter is readily immunoprecipitated with Sox6 antibody in both MEL cells and liver cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Normal IgG was used as a negative control ( Figure 4A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">The above data ( Figures 3 and 4 ) clearly <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">indicate that</cue> Sox6 acts as a repressor of the epsilony gene by directly binding to the epsilony promoter , <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">probably</cue> as a dimer</scope></scope> .</sentence>
