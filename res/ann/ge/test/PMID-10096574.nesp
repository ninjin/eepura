<sentence id="0">Glucocorticoid-induced cell death requires autoinduction of glucocorticoid receptor expression in human leukemic T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In contrast to the negative autoregulation of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) expression seen in most cells and tissues , GR expression is positively autoregulated in human leukemic T cells and in other cells sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> positive autoregulation is a necessary component of glucocorticoid-induced cell death</scope> , a wild-type GR gene under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter was stably transfected into glucocorticoid-resistant cells <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> endogenous functional receptor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Transfectants grown in the presence of tetracycline contained about 15,000 receptors/cell , a value approximately equal to basal level GR expression in glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 cells before steroid treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Under these conditions , dexamethasone had a minimal effect on cell growth , elicited little internucleosomal DNA fragmentation , and induced <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> cell cycle perturbation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of tetracycline</scope> , GR mRNA and protein expression increased 2-3-fold , and cells expressed 48,000 receptors , a level nearly equivalent to that present in 6TG1.1 cells after 18 h of autoinduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Under these conditions , dexamethasone markedly inhibited cell growth , caused G1 arrest , and induced significant internucleosomal DNA fragmentation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These studies therefore <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that basal level GR expression is inadequate to mediate glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in glucocorticoid-sensitive T cells and that positive autoregulation is a necessary component of this process</scope> .</sentence>
