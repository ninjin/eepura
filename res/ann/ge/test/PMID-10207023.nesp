<sentence id="0">Modulation of E2F complexes during G0 to S phase transition in human primary B-lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The pocket protein-E2F complexes are convergence points for cell cycle signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present report , we identified and monitored the pocket protein-E2F complexes in human primary B-lymphocytes after activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Consistent with previous data from human and mouse fibroblasts and T-lymphocytes , E2F4 and DP1 form the predominant E2F heterodimers both in G0 and G1 phases of the human B-lymphocyte cell cycle , whereas E2F1 and -3 are first detected in late G1 , and their expression levels increase towards S phase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Intriguingly , the major E2F complex that we detected in quiescent human B-lymphocytes is consisted of pRB , E2F4 , and DP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Though the levels of DP1 and -2 increase when cells progress from G0 to S , the proportion of DP1 to DP2 remains relatively constant during the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also observed an increase in electrophoretic mobility of the predominant E2F components , DP1 and E2F4 , as B-lymphocytes progressed from G0 into early G1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This increase in mobility was attributable to dephosphorylation , as lambda phosphatase treatment could convert the slower migrating forms into the corresponding faster mobility forms .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We further demonstrated that this change in phosphorylation status correlates with a decrease in DNA binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This modulation of DNA binding activity mediated through the dephosphorylation of DP1 and E2F4 could help to explain the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of in vivo DNA footprinting</scope> in late G1 and S phases of gene promoters negatively regulated through E2F sites and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> a novel mechanism for controlling E2F transcriptional activity during the transition from quiescence to proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
