<sentence id="0">Infection with Theileria annulata induces expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and transcription factor AP-1 in bovine leucocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Theileria annulata infects bovine leucocytes and results in their reversible transformation such that they become immortalised and metastatic .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The present study describes parasite-induced changes in host cell gene expression which have a direct bearing on this transformation process .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">T. annulata-infected leucocytes produce a number of novel metalloproteinase activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One of these , previously called B1 , is a 97-kDa protein which is secreted in large amounts and has been purified from protein-free , conditioned medium .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">An antiserum to this enzyme was used to isolate a cDNA clone .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The predicted protein sequence of B1 is 81 % identical to human matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) , demonstrating that it is the bovine homologue of this enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RNAase protection assays demonstrated that the MMP9 activity , unique to infected cells , is due to increased MMP9 mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We also assayed the levels of transcription factor AP-1 and demonstrated that it was constitutively present in increased amounts in Theileria-infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition we assayed the level of mRNA encoding c-Fos , a common component of AP-1 and observed that it was indeed up-regulated in infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Since AP-1 is implicated in the control of the cell cycle , and MMP9 can confer metastatic properties , these results are of considerable significance with respect to the transformed phenotype induced by Theileria infection .</sentence>
