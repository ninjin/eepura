<sentence id="0">Growth regulation and cellular changes during differentiation of human prostatic cancer LNCaP cells as induced by T lymphocyte-conditioned medium .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human prostatic epithelial cells from an androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line were examined in response to conditioned medium ( CM ) derived from phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Addition of CM caused a greater than 70 % reduction of cell proliferation by cell counting and cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These cells showed G1 phase arrest and the clonogenicity was reduced .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The growth-modulating effect was dose-dependent and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> due to cell lysis or apoptosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The binding of androgen to androgen receptor on these cells showed approximately 50 % reduction , underlining a proliferation reduction mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) was downregulated to approximately 75 % during the process .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Cell morphology showed dendritic processes extending from cytoplasm and other neuroendocrine cell characteristics .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The expression of several cytoskeleton and intracellular proteins increased as determined by immunostaining on slides and by ELISA procedures .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These included vimentin , correlating to cell shape changes , cytokeratins 8 and 18 , associated with differentiated cell types of prostate epithelia , and neuron-specific enolase and serotonin , associated with neuroendocrine cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">From these cellular changes , we can <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">infer</cue> that the cell growth was modulated along with induction of terminal differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Activated T cells were demonstrated to be important in providing the modulating activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This growth modulator was semipurified and had an estimated molecular weight 13,000 to 24,000 Da .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The activity was determined to be distinct from TGF , TNF , and some commonly known lymphokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The interaction between lymphoid and prostatic cells in growth and development is described .</sentence>
