<sentence id="1">Activation of the TAL1 ( or SCL ) gene , originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation , is the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The protein products of this gene contain the basic-helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers .</sentence>

<sentence id="4">Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin ( Epo ) , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> the expression or activity of the TAL1 gene and its protein products were affected by Epo in splenic erythroblasts from mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus ( FVA cells )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Epo elicited a rapid , dose-related increase in TAL1 mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">An Epo-inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo-induced phosphorylation of nuclear TAL1 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> Epo acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages</scope> .</sentence>
