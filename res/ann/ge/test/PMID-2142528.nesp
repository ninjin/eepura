<sentence id="0">Two distinct forms of active transcription factor CREB ( cAMP response element binding protein ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mammalian cells express two distinct forms of transcription factor CREB ( cAMP response element binding protein ) that are apparently the products of alternative splicing of the CREB gene transcript .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The two proteins differ by a 14-amino acid serine-rich insertion present in one of the CREB isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that both CREB isoforms are expressed in many cell types and mammalian species .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both encode proteins that bind specifically to a cAMP response element in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">As expected for proteins of this class , the CREB proteins bind DNA as dimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Both proteins impart cAMP-regulated transcriptional activity to a heterologous DNA-binding domain , showing that cAMP directly modulates the transcriptional stimulatory activity of CREB .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The presence of multiple CREB isoforms with identical DNA-binding specificities but differences in the presumed regulatory domain <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">raises the</cue> possibility that CREB proteins <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
