<sentence id="0">Inhibition of dexamethasone binding to human glucocorticoid receptor by New World primate cell extracts .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">if</cue> New World primates express an inhibitor that influences glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding characteristics</scope> , we examined [3H]dexamethasone binding in cytosol prepared from B95-8 lymphoid cells , derived from the cotton top tamarin ( Saguinus oedipus ) , in combination with cytosol prepared from human or rat tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">B95-8 cytosol inhibited specific binding of [3H]dexamethasone ( P < 0.01 ) when mixed with cytosol prepared from either a human lymphoid cell line ( HL ) or rat thymus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The inhibitory activity was heat labile and trypsin sensitive .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Peak inhibitory activity was found in the 150-200 kd fractions after Sephacryl G-200 ultrafiltration .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Scatchard analysis of [3H]dexamethasone binding using mixed cytosol showed a diminished GR apparent binding affinity when compared to HL cytosol .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Kinetic studies using mixed cytosol <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> B95-8 cytosol did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect the apparent dissociation rate of [3H]dexamethasone</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data demonstrate that B95-8 cells contain a competitive inhibitor that prevents binding of dexamethasone to its cognate receptor .</sentence>
