<sentence id="0">In vivo modulation of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA by inhaled fluticasone propionate in bronchial mucosa and blood lymphocytes in subjects with mild asthma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : In vivo regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) by glucocorticoids provides a means of modulating sensitivity of targeted cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">OBJECTIVE : We sought to determine the in vivo modulation of GR mRNA expression by fluticasone propionate ( FP ) in subjects with mild asthma .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : Ten atopic asthmatic subjects were treated with FP 250 microg twice daily for 4 weeks .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Before and after treatment , the patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy and sampling of venous blood for measurements of GR mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A solution hybridization assay was used for quantitative analysis of GR mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , a 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and an adrenocorticotropic hormone test before and after treatment with FP were performed .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RESULTS : A high interindividual variation in GR mRNA expression was seen .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , we detected a significant reduction of the GR mRNA levels in the endobronchial biopsy specimens after FP treatment ( 36.6 +/- 23.1 and 25.0 +/- 10.9 amol GR mRNA/microg RNA , respectively ; P < .01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In the peripheral blood lymphocytes an even more striking downregulation of the GR by its cognate ligand was documented ( 30.3 +/- 26.5 and 8.8 +/- 5 amol GR mRNA/microg RNA , respectively ; P < .001 ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> reflecting differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity between tissues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">A small but significant reduction of the 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was observed ( 233 +/- 109 and 157 +/- 66 nmol/L , respectively ; P < .01 ) , whereas the feedback regulation of glucocorticoid synthesis by means of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as assessed by the adrenocorticotropic hormone test remained normal after treatment with FP .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">CONCLUSION : The results in this study confirm the potency of the inhaled corticosteroid FP and provide evidence for a considerable tissue-specific interindividual variation in the expression of the GR .</sentence>
