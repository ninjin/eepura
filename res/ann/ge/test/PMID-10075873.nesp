<sentence id="0">Detection of intracellular phosphorylated STAT-1 by flow cytometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have applied flow cytometry to the investigation of interferon-gamma activation of human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This approach uses monoclonal antibodies that distinguish between the native and phosphorylated forms of STAT-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It enables rapid and quantitative assessment of STAT-1 phosphorylation on a discrete cell basis and is both more sensitive and less time consuming than immunoblotting .</sentence>
