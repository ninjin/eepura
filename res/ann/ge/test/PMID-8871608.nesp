<sentence id="0">The suppression of T cell function and NF(kappa)B expression by serine protease inhibitors is blocked by N-acetylcysteine .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Direct evidence that N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) enhances the immune response of peripheral blood T cells at the level of NF(kappa)B is presented .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , NAC blocks the suppression of T cell mitogenesis and cytokine production by protease inhibitors such as N-tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The proliferative responses of purified CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are suppressed more strongly by TPCK when anti-CD28 <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> the phorbol ester PMA</scope> is used as the mitogenic coactivator .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-6 , INF-gamma ) production is inhibited 95-100 % by concentrations of TPCK that totally suppress the mitogenesis of CD4+ or CD8+ cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we find that TPCK virtually abolishes ( to less than 1 % ) the levels of NF(kappa)B ( but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> Oct-1 )</scope> found in nuclear and whole cell extracts of activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Strikingly , the immunosuppressive effects of TPCK are blocked when T cells are pretreated for 15 min with 5 mM NAC .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">NAC not only blocks the effect of TPCK but enhances mitogenesis and cytokine production ( > 2.5-fold in some cases ) upon activation of unsuppressed T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our data support the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">notion</cue> that NF(kappa)B and I(kappa)B proteases play obligate roles in T cell activation and mitogenesis , roles that are enhanced significantly by NAC</scope> .</sentence>
