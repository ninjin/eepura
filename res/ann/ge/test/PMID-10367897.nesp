<sentence id="0">CBP/p300 integrates Raf/Rac-signaling pathways in the transcriptional induction of NF-ATc during T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-ATc , an inducibly expressed transcription factor , controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show here that the transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300 bind to and control the activity of the inducible N-terminal transactivation domain of NF-ATc , TAD-A .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Similar to the N terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun , TAD-A is inducibly phosphorylated , but this phosphorylation is dispensable for the interaction with CBP/p300 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Constitutive active versions of c-Raf and Rac synergistically enhance the CBP/p300-mediated increase of TAD-A activity , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> the important role CBP/p300</scope> plays in the integration of T cell activation signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since a mutation of CBP abolishing HAT activity is almost as active as wild-type CBP in T cells , functions of CBP/p300 other than histone acetylation <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to control the NF-AT-dependent transcription in T cells</scope> .</sentence>
