<sentence id="0">Resistance to IL-10 inhibition of interferon gamma production and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 in CD4+ T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-10 has been shown to block the antigen-specific T-cell cytokine response by inhibiting the CD28 signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found that peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) were able to produce greater amounts of interferon gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than were normal control CD4+ T cells , although their surface expression of the type 1 IL-10 receptor was increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was sustained in both blood and synovial tissue CD4+ T cells of RA , but <scope type="neg" id="0">it was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> augmented by the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sera from RA patients induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells , which was mostly abolished by neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Preincubation of normal CD4+ T cells with IL-6 reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of interferon gamma production .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Blood CD4+ T cells from RA patients contained higher levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 but lower levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA compared with control CD4+ T cells , as determined by real-time PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> RA CD4+ T cells become resistant to the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 before migration into synovial tissue</scope> , and this impaired IL-10 signaling <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be associated with sustained signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 induction</scope> .</sentence>
