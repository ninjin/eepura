<sentence id="0">A novel B cell-derived coactivator potentiates the activation of immunoglobulin promoters by octamer-binding transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A novel B cell-restricted activity , required for high levels of octamer/Oct-dependent transcription from an immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) promoter , was detected in an in vitro system consisting of HeLa cell-derived extracts complemented with fractionated B cell nuclear proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The factor responsible for this activity was designated Oct coactivator from B cells ( OCA-B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">OCA-B stimulates the transcription from an IgH promoter in conjunction with either Oct-1 or Oct-2 but shows <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> significant effect on the octamer/Oct-dependent transcription of the ubiquitously expressed histone H2B promoter and the transcription of USF- and Sp1-regulated promoters</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Taken together , our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that OCA-B is a tissue- , promoter- , and factor-specific coactivator and that OCA-B <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be a major determinant for B cell-specific activation of immunoglobulin promoters</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In light of the evidence showing physical and functional interactions between Oct factors and OCA-B , we propose a mechanism of action for OCA-B and discuss the implications of OCA-B for the transcriptional regulation of other tissue-specific promoters .</sentence>
