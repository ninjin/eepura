<sentence id="0">HTLV-1 Tax induces expression of various immediate early serum responsive genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) is an etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We showed here by mobility-shift assay that T-cell lines transformed with the virus contained high levels of AP-1 activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Consistent with this result , these cell lines expressed increased levels of mRNAs encoding the AP-1 proteins , c-Fos , Fra-1 , c-Jun , JunB , and JunD .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Previously , transcription of the c-fos gene has been reported to be transactivated by the viral transcription factor , Tax1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By using the human T-cell line ( JPX-9 ) , in which expression of the Tax1 is inducible , we showed that expression of mRNAs for Fra-1 , c-Jun , and JunD was also transactivated by Tax1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , Tax1 activated expression of two other transcription factors having zinc finger motifs , Egr-1 and Egr-2 , in the same cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The Tax1-inducible transcription factors identified here are encoded by the members of immediate early genes under the control of growth signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="0"> Tax1 was <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> to replace growth signals , at least in part , by this mechanism</scope> .</sentence>
