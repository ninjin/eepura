<sentence id="5">In the present study , we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the regulation of IL-17 production in RA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with RA ( n = 24 ) were separated , then stimulated with various agents including anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 , phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) and several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines .</sentence>
