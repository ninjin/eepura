<sentence id="0">The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) BMRF1 promoter for early antigen ( EA-D ) is regulated by the EBV transactivators , BRLF1 and BZLF1 , in a cell-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Epstein-Barr virus early antigen diffuse component ( EA-D ) is essential for Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase activity , and its activity is suppressed during latent infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the regulation of the promoter ( BMRF1 ) for this early gene by studying its responsiveness in vitro to two immediate-early viral transactivators , BZLF1 ( Z ) and BRLF1 ( R ) , focusing on the differences in response in lymphoid cells and epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In lymphoid cells , Z or R alone produced only small increases in EA-D promoter activity , whereas both transactivators together produced a large stimulatory effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In epithelial cells , the Z transactivator alone produced maximal stimulation of the EA-D promoter ; the effect of R and Z together was no greater than that of Z alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the EA-D promoter demonstrated that in epithelial cells the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> AP-1 binding site plays an essential role in Z responsiveness</scope> , although sequences further upstream are also important .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In lymphoid cells , only the upstream sequences are required for transactivation by the Z/R combination , and the AP-1 site is dispensable .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that EA-D ( BMRF1 ) promoter regulation by Z and R is cell type specific and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to involve different mechanisms in each cell type</scope></scope> .</sentence>
