<sentence id="0">Temperature-induced down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte in patients with sepsis or septic shock .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is of vital importance during critical illness .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have studied the adaptive mechanisms which occur at the level of the glucocorticoid receptor in glucocorticoid target tissues in patients with sepsis or septic shock .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">DESIGN : The effects of hypercortisolaemia , hyperthermia and cellular composition on number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell and their affinity were evaluated , both in vitro and in vivo , in peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes of control subjects and in patients with sepsis or septic shock .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">SUBJECTS : Fifteen patients ( age 25-79 ) with sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to an intensive care unit were studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The control group consisted of 24 healthy laboratory employees .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the glucocorticoid receptors were measured and compared to clinical data and the plasma cortisol concentrations .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RESULTS : Hypercortisolaemia , in vitro , resulted in a decreased affinity and a decreased binding capacity of the glucocorticoid receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In vitro , hyperthermia as well as variations in the cellular composition did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> influence the glucocorticoid receptor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In vivo , there was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> change in the number of receptors per cell in patients with sepsis or septic shock</scope> as compared to healthy controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">However , a decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor was observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">There was a weak but significant negative correlation between body temperature and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in the patient group .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">There was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> relation between circulating cortisol concentrations and glucocorticoid receptor affinity and number</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSIONS : There is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> obvious regulation of the number of glucocorticoid receptors by plasma cortisol concentrations in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor together with the negative correlation between hyperthermia and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in patients with sepsis or septic shock <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation during critical illness is accompanied by peripheral adaptation in glucocorticoid receptor number and affinity</scope> .</sentence>
