<sentence id="0">Expression of c-fos , c-jun and jun B in peripheral blood lymphocytes from young and elderly adults .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The expression of c-fos , c-jun and jun B proto-oncogenes was studied in phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) activated peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) from young and aged humans .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Specific mRNAs for c-fos and c-jun were detectable within 30 min after cell activation and reached maximal levels within 2 h. Both c-fos and jun B mRNAs decreased to pre-activation levels within 6 h , while c-jun mRNA remained elevated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0">In PHA-activated PBL , <cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> age-related differences were observed in c-fos or jun B mRNA expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , c-jun mRNA levels decreased significantly ( 1.73 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.09 arbitrary units , P < 0.01 , young vs. old ) in PBL from elderly individuals activated with PHA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">Because</cue> previous work has demonstrated that T cells from elderly individuals <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> display normal proliferative responses when activated via the anti-CD2 pathway</scope></scope> , c-jun and jun B mRNA expression was also studied in anti-CD2-activated purified T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">No</cue> age-related differences were found in the expression of <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">either</cue> of these two proto-oncogenes</scope> by anti-CD2 activated T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that the decreased IL-2 production and proliferative response displayed by PHA-activated PBL from elderly adults <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be related to age-related changes in c-jun mRNA expression and in the ratio of c-fos to c-jun mRNA</scope></scope> .</sentence>
