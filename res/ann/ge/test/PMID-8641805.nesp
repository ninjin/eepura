<sentence id="0">Effects of interleukin-10 on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to Cryptococcus neoformans , Candida albicans , and lipopolysaccharide .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Deactivation of mononuclear phagocytes is critical to limit the inflammatory response but <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> be detrimental in the face of progressive infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We compared the effects of the deactivating cytokine interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) responses to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , Cryptococcus neoformans , and Candida albicans .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IL-10 effected dose-dependent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) release in PBMC stimulated by LPS and C. neoformans , with significant inhibition seen with 0.1 U/ml and greater than 90 % inhibition noted with 10 U/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , even at doses as high as 100 U/ml , IL-10 inhibited TNF-alpha release in response to C. albicans by only 50 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-10 profoundly inhibited release of IL-1beta from PBMC stimulated by all three stimuli .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">TNF-alpha mRNA and release was inhibited even if IL-10 was added up to 8 h after cryptococcal stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , inhibition of IL-1 beta mRNA was of lesser magnitude and occurred only when IL-10 was added within 2 h of cryptococcal stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">IL-10 inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB in response to LPS but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> the fungal stimuli</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">All three stimuli induced IL-10 production in PBMC , although over 10-fold less IL-10 was released in response to C. neoformans compared with LPS and C. albicans .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Thus , while IL-10 has deactivating effects on PBMC responses to all three stimuli , disparate stimulus- and response-specific patterns of deactivation are seen .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="spec" id="2"> Inhibition by IL-10 of proinflammatory cytokine release <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to occur at the level of gene transcription for TNF-alpha and both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally for IL-1beta</scope> .</sentence>
