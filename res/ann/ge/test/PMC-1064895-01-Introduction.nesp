<sentence id="0">Introduction</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is characterized by infiltrations of macrophages and T cells into the joint , and synovial hyperplasia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Proinflammatory cytokines released from these cells are known to be important in the destruction of joints in RA [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The favorable clinical benefits obtained with inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ) and interleukin (IL)-1 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the blockade of key inflammatory cytokines has been the important issue in the development of new therapeutic applications [ 2 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A little over a decade ago , the primacy of T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease such as RA was undisputed because they are the largest cell population infiltrating the synovium .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , a series of studies demonstrated paucity of T cell-derived cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma in the joints of RA , whereas macrophage and fibroblast cytokines including IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-15 , IL-18 and TNF-alpha were abundant in rheumatoid synovium .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This paradox has questioned the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of RA [ 3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Because we have already demonstrated the enhanced proliferation of antigen specific T cells , especially to type II collagen , and the skewing of T helper type 1 ( Th1 ) cytokines in RA [ 4 ] , the role of T cells needs to be elucidated in different aspects .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">IL-17 is one of the inflammatory cytokines secreted mainly by activated T cells , which can induce IL-6 and IL-8 by fibroblasts [ 5 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This cytokine is of interest for two major reasons : first , similarly to TNF-alpha and IL-1 , IL-17 has proinflammatory properties ; second , it is produced by T cells [ 6 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Recent observations demonstrated that IL-17 can also activate osteoclastic bone resorption by the induction of RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB [ NF-kappaB ] ligand ) , which is involved in bony erosion in RA [ 7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">It also stimulates the production of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor by synoviocytes , and of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide by chondrocytes , and has the ability to differentiate and activate the dendritic cells [ 8-10 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Levels of IL-17 in synovial fluids were significantly higher in patients with RA than in patients with osteoarthritis ( OA ) , and it was produced by CD4+ T cells in the synovium [ 11,12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">IL-15 , secreted from activated macrophages , has been reported to be an important trigger of IL-17 production in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) by cyclosporine and steroid sensitive pathways [ 13 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Recently , Happel and colleagues also showed that IL-23 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> be an efficient trigger of IL-17 production from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [ 14 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Although the contribution of IL-17 in joint inflammation in RA has been documented in earlier studies [ 12,15,16 ] , the intracellular signal transduction pathway for IL-17 production remains uncertain .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In the present study we used various stimuli to investigate IL-17 production in PBMC of patients with RA and its signaling transduction pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">We found that the intracellular signaling pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and NF-kappaB <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be involved in the overproduction of the key inflammatory cytokine IL-17 in RA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA and future directions for new therapeutic strategies in RA</scope> .</sentence>
