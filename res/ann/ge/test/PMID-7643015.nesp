<sentence id="0">Cellular and molecular mechanisms of IFN-gamma production induced by IL-2 and IL-12 in a human NK cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) is an important immunoregulatory protein produced predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes ( LGL ) in response to different extracellular signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In particular , two interleukins ( ILs ) , IL-2 and IL-12 , have been shown to be potent inducers of IFN-gamma gene expression in both T cells and LGL .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although it has been reported that there are some T cell lines that produce IFN-gamma in response to IL-2 and IL-12 stimulation , there has as yet been <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> report of a natural killer ( NK ) cell line that responds in a similar manner</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this report we present evidence that the cell line NK3.3 derived from human NK cells , responds to both IL-2 and IL-12 , as measured by increases in IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) cytoplasmic mRNA and protein expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , when used together IL-2 and IL-12 synergized in the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF and this synergy was attributed to an increased accumulation and stability of the IFN-gamma and GM-CSF mRNAs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To investigate the signaling pathways involved in the gene induction , five inhibitors , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , transforming growth factor-beta , cycloheximide , genistein , and staurosporine A , were used in analyzing the effects of IL-2 and IL-12 on NK3.3 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that activation of protein kinase C , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> new protein synthesis</scope> , is required for IL-2 induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF cytoplasmic mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , <scope type="spec" id="3"> IL-12 induction of IFN-gamma cytoplasmic mRNA <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to only partially depend on activation of protein kinase C</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , both transforming growth factor-beta and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , could suppress IL-2 and IL-12 signaling but CsA was generally inactive .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">It also was observed that suppression of cytokine gene expression by these agents was independent of the inhibition of proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In addition , IL-2 but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> IL-12</scope> induced nuclear factors NF-kappa B and AP1 , and regulation of the nuclear levels of these two DNA binding protein complexes is correlated with IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> IL-2 and IL-12 <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression</scope> , and that the NK3.3 cell line <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways</scope></scope> .</sentence>
