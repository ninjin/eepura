<sentence id="0">Charybdotoxin-sensitive , Ca(2+)-dependent membrane potential changes are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> involved in human T or B cell activation and proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The involvement of ion channels in B and T lymphocyte activation is <cue type="spec" id="1">supported</cue> by many reports of changes in ion fluxes and membrane potential after mitogen binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Human T and B lymphocytes demonstrate an early and transient hyperpolarization after ligand binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Inasmuch as the change in membrane potential is dependent on elevation of free cytosolic calcium , the hyperpolarization is <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">presumably</cue> through opening of Ca(2+)-stimulated K+ channels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have used charybdotoxin , a known inhibitor of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels , to study the role of these channels in lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrate that charybdotoxin inhibits the ligand-induced transient membrane hyperpolarization in B and T cells in a dose-dependent fashion , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> affecting changes in cytosolic Ca2+</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , blockade of the Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> associated with changes in cell-cycle gene activation , IL-2 production , IL-2R expression or B and T cell mitogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">imply</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="5">membrane potential changes secondary to the ligand-dependent opening of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels are <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> involved in B and T lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
