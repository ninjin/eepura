<sentence id="1">beta-1-->3-D-glucans occur as a principal component of microbial cell walls or can be secreted from both , non-pathogenic and pathogenic fungi such as S. cerevisae and C. albicans [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These beta-1-->3-D-linked glucose polymers are characterized as a fungal pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMP ) [ 2 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The primary cellular recognition of beta-1-->3-D-glucans is mediated by several beta-1-->3-D-glucan receptors on phagocytes [ 3,4 ] and other cells [ 5,6 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Human as well as murine Dectin-1 has been demonstrated to be the major pattern recognition receptor ( PRR ) for intact yeast and beta-1-->3-D-glucan-containing particles ( i.e. zymosan ) on monocytes/macrophages as well as neutrophils and on primary cells [ 7-11 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the murine system , binding of zymosan to Dectin-1 resulted in production of TNFalpha through Toll-like receptor 2 and the adaptor protein MyD88 [ 12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Another water-soluble beta-1-->3-D-glucan ( PGG-glucan ) has been described to activate NFkappaB and NFIL-6 in murine cell lines [ 13,14 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similarly , it has been shown that beta-1-->3-D-glucans activate NFkappaB in a human monocyte-like cell line [ 15 ] and in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( PMN ) , in the latter case <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNFalpha ) [ 16</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">One study proposed that the production of the anti-inflammatory IL-1RA , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> IL-1 by human monocytes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be a <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potentially</cue> protective</scope> mechanism induced by beta-1-->3-D-glucan [ 17</scope> ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Three other investigations have reported that human leukocytes and human vascular endothelial cells produce IL-8 in response to zymosan [ 18 ] or a water-soluble beta-1-->3-D-glucan [ 6,19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In addition , <scope type="spec" id="4"> beta-1-->3-D-glucans <cue type="spec" id="4">seem</cue> to be able to modify the response to pro-inflammatory stimuli or even sepsis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In a murine polymicrobial sepsis model , beta-1-->3-D-glucan [ 20 ] treatment resulted in decreased septic morbidity and mortality mediated via inhibition of NFkappaB and stimulation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway [ 21,22 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These and other animal studies [ 23,24 ] as well as a clinical trial [ 25 ] support a protective role of beta-1-->3-D-glucan in certain pro-inflammatory conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects of beta-1-->3-D-glucan are only partially resolved , especially in humans .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Thus , the aim of this study was to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of beta-1-->3-D-glucans on human leukocytes in pro-inflammatory conditions with special emphasis on the cytokine profile and its transcriptional regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">For this purpose , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were exposed to a well-defined beta-1-->3-D-glucan , i.e. glucan phosphate ( GP ) [ 20,26 ] , alone or simultaneously with LPS from gram-negative bacteria or the superantigen TSST-1 from gram-positive bacteria over 48 h. Because of the potential effect of beta-1-->3-D-glucan on cytokine production [ 12,16-19 ] , TNFalpha , IL-1beta , IL-6 , IL-8 and IL-1RA were measured as well as IFNgamma , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-10 , IL-12 and TGFbeta1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Correspondingly , four NFkappaB sites from the TNFalpha promoter ( kappa consensus , kappa1 , kappa2 , kappa3 ) [ 27 ] , a kappa consensus site from the IL-8 promoter [ 28 ] , an NFAT site from the IFNgamma promoter ( ATP2 ) [ 29 ] and a consensus NFIL-6 site from the IL-6 promoter [ 13 ] were examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Because of the anti-inflammatory role of IL-1RA , we focused on binding of transcription factors to the IL-1RA promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">An inhibitory element and three positive-acting LPS-response elements ( LRE-1 , LRE-2 and LRE-3 ) in the IL-1RA promoter , including NFkappaB , PU.1 and NFIL-6 sites , have been characterized previously [ 30-33 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">Using computational analysis for homology search [ 34 ] , we looked for new binding motifs in the IL-1RA promoter .</sentence>
