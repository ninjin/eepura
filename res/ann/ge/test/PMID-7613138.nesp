<sentence id="0">The interleukin-5/receptor interaction activates Lyn and Jak2 tyrosine kinases and propagates signals via the Ras-Raf-1-MAP kinase and the Jak-STAT pathways in eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have shown that the interaction of interleukin (IL)-5 with the receptor activates Lyn tyrosine kinase within 1 min and Jak2 tyrosine kinase within 1-3 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">IL-5 also stimulates GTP binding to p21ras .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The signal is subsequently propagated through the activation of Raf-1 , MEK , and MAP kinases as shown by their increased autophosphorylation in vitro and phosphorylation in situ .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Jak2 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate STAT nuclear proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The activation of STAT nuclear factors was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a gamma activation site ( GAS ) probe .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We found that IL-5 induces two GAS-binding proteins in eosinophils , one of which is STAT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that IL-5 induced signals are propagated through two distinct pathways : ( 1 ) Lyn-->Ras-->Raf-1-->MEK-->MAP kinase and ( 2 ) Jak2-->STAT1 .</sentence>
