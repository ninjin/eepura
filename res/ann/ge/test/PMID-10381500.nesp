<sentence id="0">Genetic evidence for an additional factor required for erythropoietin-induced signal transduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Erythropoietin ( EPO ) and its receptor ( EPOR ) are required for the development of mature erythrocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">After binding of ligand , the EPOR activates a variety of signaling pathways that ultimately control cellular proliferation , survival , and specific gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although <scope type="spec" id="0"> erythroid progenitors <cue type="spec" id="0">appear</cue> to be the principal EPO-responsive cell type in vivo due to the restricted expression of the EPOR , many growth factor-dependent cell lines expressing the EPOR can respond to EPO by activating many or all of these pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , we have identified a cellular context ( the interleukin-2 [IL-2]-dependent HT-2 line ) in which the EPO stimulation of the EPOR fails to support cellular proliferation , STAT-5 induction , or MAPK activation , despite efficient phosphorylation of the EPOR and JAK2 and inhibition of apoptosis after withdrawal of IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , when we fused HT-2 cells expressing the EPOR with Ba/F3 cells in a complementation assay , the resulting hybridomas proliferated and potently activated STAT-5 and MAPK in response to EPO .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> an unidentified cellular factor is needed to mediate signaling by the EPOR</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , Ba/F3 cells apparently express this factor(s) and somatic fusions can , therefore , confer EPO-responsiveness to HT-2 cells that <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> this factor</scope> .</sentence>
