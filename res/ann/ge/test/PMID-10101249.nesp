<sentence id="0">Vitamin D receptor 3'-untranslated region polymorphisms : <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of effect on mRNA stability</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Allelic variation at the 3'-end of the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene has been associated with a 3-5-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer and with differences in bone mineralization .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This genetic diversity does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> alter the VDR protein structurally</scope> , but instead <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be a marker(s) of other , nearby polymorphisms that influence message stability or translation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The work reported here was instigated to identify additional VDR 3'-UTR polymorphisms that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> have functional significance</scope> and to then test <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">whether</cue> these genetic variants alter message stability</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Initially , four novel , frequently occurring sequence variants were identified that associated with two common haplotypes that were described previously .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="5">These common sequence variants were <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> found within three message-destabilizing elements that we mapped within the 3'-UTR of the vitamin D receptor mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the two VDR 3'-UTR haplotypes conferred an identical half-life on a heterologous beta-globin reporter gene , in an in vitro assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We therefore conclude that common polymorphisms within the VDR 3'-UTR do <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> influence message stability</scope> .</sentence>
