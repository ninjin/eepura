<sentence id="0">Modulation of normal erythroid differentiation by the endogenous thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors : a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> target for v-erbA oncogene action</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The v-erbA oncogene , a mutated version of the thyroid hormone receptor alpha ( c-erbA/TR-alpha ) , inhibits erythroid differentiation and constitutively represses transcription of certain erythrocyte genes , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a normal function of the proto-oncogene c-erbA in erythropoiesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we demonstrate that the endogenous thyroid hormone receptor alpha ( c-erbA/TR-alpha ) and the closely related retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR-alpha ) play a role in the regulation of normal erythroid differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Retinoic acid ( RA ) distinctly modulated the erythroid differentiation program of normal erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts reversibly transformed by a conditional tyrosine kinase oncogene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When added pulsewise to immature cells , differentiation was accelerated while more mature cells underwent premature cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thyroid hormone ( T3 ) alone caused similar but weaker effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , T3 strongly enhanced the action of RA , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> cooperative action of the two receptors in modulating erythroid differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Expression of the human RAR-alpha in receptor-negative erythroblasts conferred RA-induced regulation of differentiation to the otherwise unresponsive cells , thus showing that the RAR-alpha is essential for the RA effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Likewise , enhanced expression of exogenous c-erbA/TR-alpha in erythroblasts rendered them susceptible to modulation of differentiation by T3 , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> a similar function of both receptors</scope> .</sentence>
