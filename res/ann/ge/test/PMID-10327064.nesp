<sentence id="0">c-Myc and E1A induced cellular sensitivity to activated NK cells involves cytotoxic granules as death effectors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The contact of natural killer ( NK ) cells with foreign cells and with certain virus-infected or tumor cells triggers the cytolytic machinery of NK cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This triggering leads to exocytosis of the cytotoxic NK cell granules .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The oncoproteins c-Myc and E1A render cells vulnerable to NK cell mediated cytolysis yet the mechanisms of sensitization are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> well understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In a model where foreign cells ( rat fibroblasts ) were cocultured with human IL-2 activated NK cells , we observed that NK cells were capable of efficiently killing their targets only if the cells overexpressed the oncogene c-Myc or E1A .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both the parental and the oncogene expressing fibroblasts similarly triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the bound NK cells , demonstrating that NK cells were cytolytically activated in contact with both resistant parental and oncogene expressing sensitive target fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The cell death was independent of wild-type p53 and <scope type="neg" id="1">was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> inhibited by an anti-apoptotic protein EIB19K</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results provided evidence that c-Myc and E1A activated the NK cell induced cytolysis at a post-triggering stage of NK cell-target cell interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In consistence , the c-Myc and E1A overexpressing fibroblasts were more sensitive to the cytolytic effects of isolated NK cell-derived granules than parental cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> oncogenes activate the cytotoxicity of NK cell granules</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This mechanism can have a role in directing the cytolytic action of NK cells towards the virus-infected and cancer cells .</sentence>
