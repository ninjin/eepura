<sentence id="0">Nonopsonic phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes requires the presence of the bacterial flagellum .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Whereas the mechanism of nonopsonic phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been described , the bacterial ligands required are poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To identify the requisite bacterial ligands , studies with isogenic mutants of P. aeruginosa PAK lacking pili , flagella , and the RpoN sigma factor were undertaken .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The RpoN mutant , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> pili , flagella , and nonpilus adhesins</scope> , bound poorly and was resistant to ingestion by both macrophages and neutrophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="1">Pili were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> absolutely required for binding or phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The presence of a flagellum was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> required for binding of P. aeruginosa to macrophages but was critical for the subsequent internalization of the bacterium , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that this factor or a surface ligand associated with its assembly was responsible for stimulation of nonopsonic phagocytosis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
