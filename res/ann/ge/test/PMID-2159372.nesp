<sentence id="0">Effects of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line RWLeu-4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The effects of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) on proliferation , differentiation , and macromolecular synthesis in the new Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line , RWLeu-4 , were investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Binding of [3H]VD3 was saturable , with approximately 2000-3000 sites/cell , and half-maximal binding occurring at 0.21-0.33 nM .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Treatment of RWLeu-4 cells with VD3 induced 24R-hydroxylase activity , a marker of vitamin D3 responsiveness in many tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Exposure of RWLeu-4 cells to VD3 also inhibited proliferation and DNA synthesis with a 50 % effective dose of 3.5-10 nM within 72 h ; in addition , protein and RNA synthesis were inhibited by VD3 treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Exposure of RWLeu-4 cells to 5 nM VD3 for 72 h caused 50 % of the cells to differentiate into macrophage/monocyte type cells as judged by nitroblue tetrazolium staining and adherence to plastic .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Progressive expression of cell surface maturation-specific antigens of the monocyte/macrophage lineage was induced by treatment of RWLeu-4 cells with VD3 for 24 to 72 h at doses that inhibited cellular proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">c-myc RNA , which is constitutively expressed in RWLeu-4 cells , increased after 0.5 h of treatment with 50 nM VD3 and then rapidly decreased to barely detectable levels after 4 h of treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity associated with the p210bcr-abl oncogene product was decreased approximately 50 % by VD3 treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Because of the presence of a functional receptor-effector system for VD3 and multiple biological responses to the hormone , these cells provide a unique model system with which to probe the specific effects of VD3 on cell growth and differentiation in chronic myelogenous leukemia .</sentence>
