<sentence id="0">FK506 and ciclosporin : molecular probes for studying intracellular signal transduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The immunosuppressants ciclosporin and FK506 block the Ca(2+)-dependent signal-transduction pathway emanating from the T-cell receptor , thereby inhibiting the activation of helper T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using these drugs as probes , chemists and biologists have uncovered several intracellular signalling molecules bridging the generation of second-messenger Ca2+ ions and the transcriptional activation of IL-2 , among which are calmodulin , calcineurin and the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Hence , Ca2+ binds to calmodulin , leading to the binding of calmodulin to calcineurin ; the activated calcineurin , in turn , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> dephosphorylate the cytoplasmic subunit of NF-AT , resulting in its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to form a competent transcriptional activator</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As described by Jun Liu , these drugs manifest their effects in an unprecedented fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">They do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> directly intercept intracellular signalling molecules</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Instead , they form tight complexes with two different classes of abundant cytosolic receptors called immunophilins upon entering the cell , and consequently inhibit their peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The two structurally distinct immunophilin-drug complexes bind to , and inhibit , the phosphatase activity of calcineurin .</sentence>
