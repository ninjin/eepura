<sentence id="0">Binding characteristics of the glucocorticoid receptor in peripheral blood lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although the exact etiology of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) remains unresolved , <scope type="spec" id="0"> immune reactions are <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be the central pathogenic mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Endogenous and therapeutic steroid hormones affect the immune system , and inflammatory diseases are associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , providing evidence of an immune-endocrine interplay .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Function tests in MS have revealed dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system in a substantial proportion of patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We characterized glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 39 MS patients and 14 age- and sex-matched controls with respect to dissociation constant and binding capacity , using a whole-cell binding assay with [3H]dexamethasone as the ligand .</sentence>

<sentence id="7">GR binding parameters were analyzed in relation to the results of the combined dexamethasone-CRH test , which reflects corticosteroid receptor function at the hypothalamus , in 30 patients and 9 controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">While controls showed a moderate correlation between binding affinity of the GR in lymphocytes and regulatory function at the hypothalamic level , the patients did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that the physiological relationship between binding and function of the glucocorticoid receptor is disturbed in MS</scope> .</sentence>
