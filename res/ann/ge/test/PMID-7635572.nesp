<sentence id="0">RB and a novel E2F-1 binding protein in MHC class II deficient B-cell lines and normal IFN-gamma induction of the class IL transactivator CIITA in class II non-inducible RB-defective tumor lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The major histocompatibility ( MHC ) class II genes encode cell surface proteins that bind antigenic peptide for presentation to T-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The class II proteins are expressed constitutively on B-cells and EBV-transformed B-cells , and are inducible by IFN-gamma on a wide variety of cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Retinoblastoma protein ( RB ) is a tumor suppressor and functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding and inactivating the transactivator E2F-I .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RB-defective tumor lines are non-inducible for MHC class II by IFN-gamma , or very weakly inducible , but transfection of 2 different lines with RB expression vectors re-establishes or substantially enhances class II inducibility .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , we examined the RB status of a series of B-cell mutants that are defective in class II expression , generated either in vitro or derived from Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome ( BLS ) patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Nuclear matrix-bound RB was detectable in all cases , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> loss of RB is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> responsible for decreased class II expression in these lines</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A second E2F-I binding protein , most <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> DP-I , was also apparently normal in both class II-positive and -negative B-cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We also examined the IFN-gamma induction of CIITA in RB-defective lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CIITA is a class II gene transactivator known to be defective in one form of BLS and to be required for the induction of MHC class II by IFN-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CIITA mRNA is normally inducible by IFN-gamma in class II non-inducible , RB-defective lines , and in one line , re-expression of RB has <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> effect on CIITA mRNA induction levels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Thus , the block in MHC class II inducibility in RB-defective cells is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> due to a block in CIITA inducibility</scope> .</sentence>
