<sentence id="1">Nonhuman primates are naturally infected with a B-lymphotropic herpesvirus closely related to Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These simian EBV share considerable genetic , biologic , and epidemiologic features with human EBV , including virus-induced tumorigenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , latent , transformation-associated viral genes demonstrate marked sequence divergence among species despite the conserved functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have cloned the latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) homologs from the simian EBV naturally infecting baboons ( cercopithicine herpesvirus 12 , herpesvirus papio ) and rhesus monkeys ( cercopithicine herpesvirus 15 ) for a comparative study with the human EBV oncogene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The transmembrane domains are well conserved , but there is striking sequence divergence of the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain essential for B-cell immortalization and interaction with the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Nevertheless , the simian EBV LMP1s retain most functions in common with EBV LMP1 , including the ability to induce NF-(kappa)B activity in human cells , to bind the tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 3 ( TRAF3 ) in vitro , and to induce expression of tumor necrosis factor-responsive genes , such as ICAM1 , in human B lymphocytes .</sentence>
