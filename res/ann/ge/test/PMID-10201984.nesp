<sentence id="0">The functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 involves p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and is associated with the augmentation of STAT serine phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-12 and IL-2 can stimulate mitogen- or CD3-activated T cells to proliferate , produce IFN-gamma , and kill tumor cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The magnitude of these functional responses is greatly augmented when T cells are activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although peripheral blood T cells are largely unresponsive to these cytokines <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> prior activation</scope> , a small subset of CD8+ T cells ( CD8+CD18bright ) is strongly activated by the combination of IL-12 and IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this report we show that the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 in CD8+CD18bright T cells correlates with the activation of the stress kinases , p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal kinase , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> with the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The functional synergy between IL-2 and IL-12 is also associated with a prominent increase in STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation over that observed with IL-12 or IL-2 alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By contrast , <scope type="neg" id="2">STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> augmented over that seen with either cytokine alone</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase completely inhibits the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 induced by IL-12 and IL-2 and abrogates the functional synergy between IL-12 and IL-2 <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> affecting STAT tyrosine phosphorylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> that p38 MAP kinase <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> play an important role in regulating STAT serine phosphorylation in response to the combination of IL-12 and IL-2</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , these findings <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicate that</cue> the optimal activation of T cells by IL-12 and IL-2 <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> depend on an interaction between the p38 MAP kinase and Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathways</scope></scope> .</sentence>
