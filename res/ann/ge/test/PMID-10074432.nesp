<sentence id="0">A direct interaction between the adaptor protein Cbl-b and the kinase zap-70 induces a positive signal in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex induces a rapid increase in the activities of Src-family and Syk/Zap-70-family kinases [ 1 ] [ 2 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These activated kinases then induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins , eventually leading to T-cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">One of the prominent substrates for these kinases is the adaptor protein Cbl [ 3 ] and recent studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that Cbl negatively regulates upstream kinases such as Syk and Zap-70 [ 4 ] [ 5 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Cbl-b , a homologue of Cbl , is widely expressed in many tissues and cells including hematopoietic cells [ 6 ] [ 7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Cbl-b undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation of the TCR and cytokine receptors [ 8 ] [ 9 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The role of Cbl-b is <cue type="spec" id="1">unclear</cue> , however</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Here , we show that overexpression of Cbl-b in T cells induced the constitutive activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A loss-of-function mutation in Cbl-b disrupted the interaction between Cbl-b and Zap-70 and nearly completely abrogated the Cbl-b-mediated activation of NFAT .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Unlike the proposed role of Cbl as a negative regulator , our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the Cbl homologue Cbl-b has a positive role in T-cell signaling , most <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> via a direct interaction with the upstream kinase Zap-70</scope></scope> .</sentence>
