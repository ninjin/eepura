<sentence id="0">Visualization of the endogenous NF-kappa B p50 subunit in the nucleus of follicular dendritic cells in germinal centers .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappa B , a 50 kDa/65 kDa ( p50/p65 ) heterodimer , is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the positive regulation of various immune genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The aim of this study was to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> NF-kappa B is related to <scope type="spec" id="1"> a particular cell type <cue type="spec" id="1">and/or</cue> differentiation step</scope> during immunopoiesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using in situ hybridization on sections from non HIV hyperplastic lymph nodes , we found that the gene of the 105 kDa precursor of p50 was overexpressed in the light zone of germinal centers , with a network aspect , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> the involvement of follicular dendritic cells ( FDC )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By immunohistochemistry , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of FDC , confirming the involvement of FDC .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of all lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , we focused our study on isolated FDC clusters from normal tonsils .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As showed on tissue sections , we detected the p50 in both cytoplasm and nucleus of FDC .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Nuclei of lymphocytes from FDC clusters were negative .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We next studied p65 and c-Rel protein expression in FDC clusters .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">p65 was detected in the cytoplasm of FDC , whereas nuclei were negative .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Furthermore , p65 was detected in the nuclei of some lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">c-Rel protein was detected only in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes and <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> in the nucleus and cytoplasm of FDC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Our results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicated that</cue> , in the context of T cell-dependent B cell immunopoiesis occurring in FDC clusters , p50 is mainly related to FDC with a massive overexpression in the nuclei , whereas p65 is expressed in a scattered manner in the nuclei of lymphocytes and c-Rel protein exclusively in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes from FDC clusters</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">These results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggested</cue> that the two subunits of NF-kappa B and the c-Rel protein have different roles in different cell types during B cell immunopoiesis</scope> .</sentence>
