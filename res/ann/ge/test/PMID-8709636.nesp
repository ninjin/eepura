<sentence id="0">Effects of IL-10 and IL-4 on LPS-induced transcription factors ( AP-1 , NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B ) which are involved in IL-6 regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , like IL-4 , is known to inhibit cytokine expression in activated human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We showed that both IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting the transcription rate of the IL-6 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The strong inhibition of the IL-6 transcription rate prompted us to study the effect of IL-10 and IL-4 on the expression of transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We questioned <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether or</cue> not IL-10 and IL-4 affected the expression of transcription factors that are known to be involved in the control of the IL-6 transcription rate , namely activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , nuclear factor IL-6 ( NF-IL6 ) , and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) we showed that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibited LPS-induced AP-1 binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The inhibiting effect of IL-4 was slightly more pronounced than that of IL-10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Downregulation of LPS-induced AP-1 was accompanied , and thus <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> explained , by a reduced expression at mRNA level of the two major components of the AP-1 complex , namely c-fos and c-jun</scope> as determined by Northern experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Binding activity of NF-IL6 was also strongly inhibited by IL-4 whereas IL-10 showed <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">NF-IL6 mRNA levels were <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affected by IL-10 or IL-4</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that IL-4 affects binding activity of preexisting NF-IL6</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10"><scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">Neither</cue> IL-10 <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">nor</cue> IL-4 inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappa B binding activity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In agreement with this finding , Northern experiments where p65 and p105 mRNA levels were determined , demonstrated that <scope type="neg" id="7">expression of these components of the NF-kappa B transcription factor were <cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> affected by IL-10 or IL-4</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Furthermore , <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">neither</cue> IL-10 <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">nor</cue> IL-4 showed any effect on I-kappa B mRNA expression</scope></scope> as determined by Northern experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Thus , IL-10 and IL-4 similarly affect IL-6 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">However , for IL-4 this was accompanied with a reduction of AP-1 and NF-IL6 binding activity whereas IL-10 only inhibited AP-1 binding activity .</sentence>
