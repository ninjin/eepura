<sentence id="0">Regulation of the human interleukin-2 gene by the alpha and beta isoforms of the glucocorticoid receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids are largely due to transcriptional inhibition of immunologically relevant genes , such as the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These effects are mediated by the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In humans , alternative splicing of the GR precursor mRNA gives rise to two receptor isoforms , termed GRalpha and GRbeta .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We previously demonstrated that GRbeta <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> antagonize GRalpha-mediated transactivation of a glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE)-driven reporter gene in COS-7 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The present study was designed to analyze the roles of the two GR isoforms on glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression of the IL-2 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using a recently developed transfection technique , we demonstrate that in primary human lymphocytes , stimulation of a 548 bp IL-2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct by phorbol ester and calcium ionophore is reversed by dexamethasone to a similar extent as in Jurkat T lymphoma cells transfected with a GRalpha expression vector .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Transfection of a GRbeta expression vector alone did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> result in IL-2 promoter repression in response to glucocorticoids</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , GRbeta did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> antagonize the repressive effects of GRalpha on IL-2 promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Surprisingly , overexpression of GRbeta in Jurkat cells did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> cause significant inhibition of GRalpha-induced transactivation of a GRE-dependent luciferase reporter gene either</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We conclude that the transrepressive effect of glucocorticoids on IL-2 gene transcription is exclusively mediated by GRalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="neg" id="4">GRbeta can <cue type="neg" id="4">neither</cue> antagonize GRalpha-mediated transactivation <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">nor</cue> transrepression in Jurkat cells</scope></scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating</cue> a cell type-specific pattern of GRbeta-mediated antiglucocorticoid activity</scope> .</sentence>
