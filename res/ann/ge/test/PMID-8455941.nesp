<sentence id="0">The transcriptionally active factors mediating the effect of the HTLV-I Tax transactivator on the IL-2R alpha kappa B enhancer include the product of the c-rel proto-oncogene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transactivator HTLV-I Tax activates the promoter of the gene coding for the interleukin 2 alpha-chain receptor ( IL-2R alpha ) via a kappa B site that can bind several protein species of the rel family .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tax1 strongly activates the enhancer activity of this motif , in both epithelial HeLa and lymphoid Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0">This activation was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> observed in undifferentiated embryocarcinoma F9 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Overexpression of the p50 , p65 and Rel proteins in these cells showed that significant activation of the IL-2R alpha kappa B site was observed only with Rel and Rel plus p65 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , whereas both Tax and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) are able to efficiently induce the binding of NF-kappa B to the IL-2R alpha kappa B site , PMA is functionally inactive .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using the DNA affinity precipitation assay , we observed that Tax1 is able to efficiently induce the binding of Rel , whereas PMA is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This established a clear difference between both stimuli , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> Rel is the functionally active factor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude from these results that the functional activity of members of the rel family is regulated by their interaction with DNA and that Rel <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">can</cue> be a <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">potent</cue> transcriptional activator on specific kappa B sites</scope></scope> .</sentence>
