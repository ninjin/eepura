<sentence id="0">p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mediates signal integration of TCR/CD28 costimulation in primary murine T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Optimal T cell activation requires two signals , one generated by TCR and another by the CD28 costimulatory receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we investigated the regulation of costimulation-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activation in primary mouse T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast to that reported for human Jurkat T cells , we found that p38 MAPK , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> Jun NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK )</scope> , is weakly activated upon stimulation with either anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 in murine thymocytes and splenic T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , p38 MAPK is activated strongly and synergistically by either CD3/CD28 coligation or PMA/Ca2+ ionophore stimulation , which mimics TCR-CD3/CD28-mediated signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activation of p38 MAPK correlates closely with the stimulation of T cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , PMA-induced JNK activation is inhibited by Ca2+ ionophore .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">T cell proliferation and production of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN-gamma induced by both CD3 and CD3/CD28 ligation and the nuclear expression of the c-Jun and ATF-2 proteins are each blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK 1 ) plays an important role in signal integration during costimulation of primary mouse T cells , 2 ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be involved in the induction of c-Jun activation and augmentation of AP-1 transcriptional activity</scope> , and 3 ) regulates <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> T cells enter a state of functional unresponsiveness</scope> .</sentence>
