<sentence id="1">We have identified and characterized a previously unrecognized form of acute leukemia that shares features of both myeloid and natural killer ( NK ) cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">From a consecutive series of 350 cases of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , we identified 20 cases ( 6 % ) with a unique immunophenotype : CD33+ , CD56+ , CD11a+ , CD13lo , CD15lo , CD34+/- , HLA-DR- , CD16- .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Multicolor flow cytometric assays confirmed the coexpression of myeloid ( CD33 , CD13 , CD15 ) and NK cell-associated ( CD56 ) antigens in each case , whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assays confirmed the identity of CD56 ( neural cell adhesion molecule ) in leukemic blasts .</sentence>

<sentence id="5">Leukemic blasts in the majority of cases shared unique morphologic features ( deeply invaginated nuclear membranes , scant cytoplasm with fine azurophilic granularity , and finely granular Sudan black B and myeloperoxidase cytochemical reactivity ) that were remarkably similar to those of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) ; particularly the microgranular variant ( FAB AML-M3v ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , all 20 cases lacked the t(15 ; 17 ) and 17 cases tested <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lacked</cue> the promyelocytic/retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) fusion transcript in RT-PCR assays ; 12 cases had 46 , XX or 46 , XY karyotypes</scope> , whereas 2 cases had abnormalities of chromosome 17q : 1 with del(17)(q25) and the other with t(11 ; 17 ) ( q23 ; q21 ) and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/RAR alpha fusion transcript .</sentence>
