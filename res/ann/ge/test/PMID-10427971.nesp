<sentence id="0">Diminished responses to IL-13 by human monocytes differentiated in vitro : role of the IL-13Ralpha1 chain and STAT6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The primary IL-13 receptor complex on human monocytes is <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be a heterodimer comprised of the IL-4R alpha chain and the IL-2R gamma chain ( gamma(c))-like molecule , IL-13R alpha1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">mRNA levels for IL-13R alpha1 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> IL-4R alpha</scope> , were markedly decreased in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMac ) , and with increasing time of monocytes in culture correlated with the loss of IL-13 regulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis of cell lines Daudi and THP-1 that differentially express gamma(c) and IL-13R alpha1 showed that IL-13 can activate STAT6 in IL-13R alpha1-positive THP-1 cells but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in gamma(c)-positive , IL-13R alpha1-negative Daudi cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IL-13 activation of STAT6 was reduced in MDMac which was associated with diminished IL-13-induced expression of CD23 and MHC class II .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , with reduced IL-13R alpha1 expression and low nuclear STAT6 activity , some IL-13-induced responses were unaltered in magnitude in MDMac .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of functional IL-13R alpha1 and gamma(c)</scope> , IL-13 must signal through an alternative receptor complex on MDMac .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Experiments with a blocking antibody to IL-4R alpha showed that this chain remains an essential component of the IL-13 receptor complex on MDMac .</sentence>
