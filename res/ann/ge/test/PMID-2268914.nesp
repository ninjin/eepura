<sentence id="2">In animal experiment , GCR of spleen lymphocytic cell was also measured in 18 aged rats and 9 young rats .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The results showed that GCR was significantly lower in the aged persons or rats than that in the young while the plasma cortisol level did n't change with aging .</sentence>
