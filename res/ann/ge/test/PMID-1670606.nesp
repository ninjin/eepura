<sentence id="0">Activation of human CD4 T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interaction of fibronectin with VLA-5 receptor on CD4 cells induces the AP-1 transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Fibronectin synergized with anti-CD3 antibody to promote CD4 cell proliferation in a serum-free culture system whereas no proliferation was observed when CD4 cells were cultured with anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , anti-CD29 ( integrin beta 1 ) as well as anti-VLA-5 ( human fibronectin receptor ) antibodies blocked this CD4 cell activation in this system .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone cannot induce IL-2 message by CD4 cells , the combination of anti-CD3 plus fibronectin induced IL-2 message by CD4 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which IL-2 message was generated , we showed that a fibronectin-VLA-5 fibronectin receptor interaction <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> contribute an independent signal distinct from the CD3 pathway of activation by the induction of an AP-1 transcriptional factor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus the VLA-5 fibronectin receptor on CD4 cells can play a complementary role in CD3-TCR-mediated signal transduction through its interaction with fibronectin .</sentence>
