<sentence id="0">Retinoic acid-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid receptor-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD38 is a leukocyte differentiation antigen <scope type="spec" id="0"> that has been <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be a phenotypic marker of different subpopulations of T- and B- lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In myeloid cells , CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Virtually <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> information</scope> is available on regulation and functions of CD38 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recently we reported that all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid-alpha receptor ( RAR alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">ATRA <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">failed</cue> to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line ( designated HL-60R ) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor ( RAR alpha ) into this HL-60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , CD38 expression was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> inducible by ATRA in HL-60R cells</scope> , transfected with a functional RAR beta , RAR gamma , or RXR alpha receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Following culture with ATRA , increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells , but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> on normal circulating granulocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">From these results , we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RAR alpha in HL-60 cells , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> a similar role for RAR alpha in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells</scope> .</sentence>
