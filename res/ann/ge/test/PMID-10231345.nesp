<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Growing evidence <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates that</cue> the immune system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system are linked by several mechanisms , for example intracellular glucocorticoid receptors ( hGR )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Glucocorticoids are the standard treatment of acute attacks of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Binding of glucocorticoids to hGR down-regulates the transcription of inflammatory genes that can propagate IBD .</sentence>
