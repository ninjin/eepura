<sentence id="0">SCL and related hemopoietic helix-loop-helix transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The helix-loop-helix ( HLH ) proteins are a family of transcription factors that include proteins critical to differentiation and development in species ranging from plants to mammals .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Five members of this family ( MYC , SCL , TAL-2 , LYL-1 and E2A ) are implicated in oncogenic events in human lymphoid tumors because of their consistent involvement in chromosomal translocations .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although activated in T cell leukemias , expression of SCL and LYL-1 is low or undetectable in normal T cell populations .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">SCL is expressed in erythroid , megakaryocyte and mast cell populations ( the same cell lineages as GATA-1 , a zinc-finger transcription factor ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , both SCL and GATA-1 undergo coordinate modulation during chemically induced erythroid differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells and are down-modulated during myeloid differentiation of human K562 cells , thus <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">implying</cue> a role for SCL in erythroid differentiation events</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , in contrast to GATA-1 , SCL is expressed in the developing brain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Studies of the function of SCL <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> it is also important in proliferation and self-renewal events in erythroid cells</scope> .</sentence>
