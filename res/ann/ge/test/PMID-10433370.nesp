<sentence id="0">Selective DNA-binding activity of interleukin-10-stimulated STAT molecules in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It has been demonstrated that interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) have various reverse effects on macrophages ; however , <scope type="neg" id="0">the molecular mechanism of this difference has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been fully understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we analyzed the binding activity of IL-10- and IFN-gamma-activated STAT molecules to two kinds of GAS-motif sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IL-10-activated STAT1 could bind to the GAS-motif sequence in the promoter region of the Fcgamma receptor , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> to that in the promoter region of the COX-2 gene</scope> , whereas IFN-gamma-activated STAT1 and STAT5 could bind to both sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IL-10 inhibited IFN-gamma-induced STAT activation <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> newly synthesized protein</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We further demonstrated that aspirin , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> dexamethasone</scope> , suppressed IFN-gamma-induced STAT activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that IL-10-activated STAT1 has a specificity in binding to the GAS-motif sequences , whereas IFN-gamma-activated STAT1 and STAT5 have a broader spectrum in binding to the GAS-motif sequences</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> explain the difference between IL-10 and IFN-gamma in biological activity , and the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on IFN-gamma activities</scope> .</sentence>
