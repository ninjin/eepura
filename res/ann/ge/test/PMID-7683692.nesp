<sentence id="2">In a subject with primary cortisol resistance we have observed glucocorticoid receptors ( hGR ) with a decreased affinity for dexamethasone .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesize</cue> that a mutation of the hGR glucocorticoid-binding domain is the cause of cortisol resistance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Total RNA isolated from the index subject 's mononuclear leukocytes was used to produce first strand hGR cDNAs , and the entire hGR cDNA was amplified in segments and sequenced .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">At nucleotide 2,317 we identified a homozygous A for G point mutation that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">predicts</cue> an isoleucine ( ATT ) for valine ( GTT ) substitution at amino acid 729</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">When the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were expressed in COS-1 cells and assayed for [3H]-Dexamethasone binding , the dissociation constants were 0.799 +/- 0.068 and 1.54 +/- 0.06 nM ( mean +/- SEM ) ( P < 0.01 ) , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">When the wild-type hGR and hGR-Ile 729 were expressed in CV-1 cells that were cotransfected with the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) gene , the hGR-Ile 729 conferred a fourfold decrease in apparent potency on dexamethasone stimulation of CAT activity .</sentence>
