<sentence id="0">Minimally modified low density lipoprotein-induced inflammatory responses in endothelial cells are mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously shown that minimally oxidized LDL ( MM-LDL ) activated endothelial cells to increase their interaction with monocytes but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> neutrophils</scope> , inducing monocyte but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> neutrophil</scope> binding and synthesis of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and monocyte colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present studies we have examined the signaling pathways by which this monocyte-specific response is induced .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="2">Both induction of monocyte binding and mRNA levels for M-CSF by MM-LDL were <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> inhibited in protein kinase C-depleted endothelial cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A number of our studies <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> cAMP is the second messenger for the effects of MM-LDL cited above</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Incubation of endothelial cells with MM-LDL caused a 173 % increase in intracellular cAMP levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Agents which increased cAMP levels , including cholera toxin , pertussis toxin , dibutyryl cAMP , and isoproterenol mimicked the actions of MM-LDL .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Agents which elevated cAMP were also shown to activate NF kappa B , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> a role for this transcription factor in activation of monocyte-endothelial interactions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although <scope type="spec" id="6"> endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) mRNA synthesis <cue type="spec" id="6">can</cue> be regulated by NF kappa B</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="5">ELAM was <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> expressed</scope> and ELAM mRNA was only slightly elevated in response to MM-LDL .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We present evidence that induction of neutrophil binding by LPS is actually suppressed by agents that elevated cAMP levels .</sentence>
