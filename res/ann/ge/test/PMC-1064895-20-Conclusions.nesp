<sentence id="0">Conclusions</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have detected a more pronounced production of IL-17 from RA PBMC in response to IL-15 and MCP-1 as well as stimulation by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have also shown that upregulation of IL-17 by activated T cells in patients with RA <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> be the result of activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway with resultant NF-kappaB activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our data provide insights into cellular mechanisms of the regulation of IL-17 production in RA , and highlight the role of T cells , which has hitherto been neglected in RA pathogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Together with recent data on the successful introduction of anti-IL-17 in RA , our results have added information for the future molecular targeting of new therapeutic applications in RA .</sentence>
