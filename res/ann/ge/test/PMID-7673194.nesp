<sentence id="0">Microtubules mediate cellular 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 trafficking and the genomic response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The genomic actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D3 ) are mediated by the intracellular vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although immunocytochemistry has shown that disruption of microtubular assembly prevents nuclear access of the sterol-VDR complex , <scope type="neg" id="0">the role of microtubules in the response to 1,25(OH)2D3 has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been studied in viable cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our studies examined this interaction in normal human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Monocytes convert 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 and to 24-hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1,25(OH)2D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Microtubule disruption totally abolished the ability of exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 to suppress its own synthesis and to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA and activity , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> affecting either total 1,25(OH)2D3 uptake or maximal 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , intact microtubules are essential for 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent modulation of gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , microtubule disruption also decreased monocyte 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> by decreasing the Vmax of monocyte mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase</scope> but through an increase in the Km for 25(OH)2D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We examined 25(OH)D3 transport .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Microtubule disruption did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affect total cellular 25(OH)D3 uptake</scope> but reduced its intracellular trafficking to the mitochondria .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Thus , microtubules participate in intracellular 25(OH)D3 transport , and their integrity determines normal 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis .</sentence>
