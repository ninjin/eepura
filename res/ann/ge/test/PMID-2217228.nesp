<sentence id="1">1) There exists a CR of GR in human leukocytes , PMN , and monocytes with the peak values from 0400 to 0800 hr and the trough values between 2300 and 0000 hr .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The difference between them was significant statistically .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">2 ) The FI of the chemotactic migration rate of PMN by cortisol also showed diurnal changes which were synchronous with that of GR .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> the CR of GR <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be of functional significance</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">3 ) In Cushing 's syndrome , the CR of GR was normal in spite of the fact that the CR of plasma cortisol was disturbed .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates</cue> the independency of the CR of GR from that of cortisol</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">4 ) In apoplexy caused by brain ischemia , the CR of GR was abolished in patients with basal lesions but preserved when the lesions were located in the cerebral cortex .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results strongly <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the main " circadian pacemaker " of GR is located in the basal brain , most <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">probably</cue> in the suprachiasmatic nuclei as has been <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggested</cue> for rodents</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
