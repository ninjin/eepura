<sentence id="0">The role of gamma/delta T cell receptor positive cells in pregnancy .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PROBLEM : Due to the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of classical HLA antigens on the trophoblast , fetal antigens</scope> are <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> presented in a non major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) restricted way</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Decidual gammadelta T cells , which significantly increase in number during pregnancy , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> play a role in recognition of fetal antigens and also in determining the quality of the response to these antigens</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our study was aimed at investigating the role of this cell population in progesterone-dependent immunomodulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHOD OF STUDY : Peripheral lymphocytes from healthy pregnant women and from habitual aborters were tested by immunocytochemistry for the presence of gamma/delta T cell receptor ( TCR ) and progesterone receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To investigate the effect of treatment with a pan anti gamma/delta antibody , lymphocytes were incubated for 3 hr with the antibody , and then interleukin (IL)-10 , IL-12 and progesterone-induced blocking factor ( PIBF ) expression ( by immuno-cytochemistry ) as well as natural killer ( NK ) cell activity were determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : In peripheral blood of healthy pregnant women the percentage of gamma/delta TCR+ cells was significantly higher ( P < 0.001 ) than in that of recurrent aborters or of non-pregnant individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Ninety-seven percent of gamma/delta TCR+ pregnancy lymphocytes expressed progesterone receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Binding of a specific antibody to the gamma/delta TCR inhibited PIBF- as well as IL-10 production , whereas it increased NK activity and IL-12 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSIONS : These data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> the role of gamma/delta TCR-bearing lymphocytes in progesterone-dependent immunomodulation</scope> .</sentence>
