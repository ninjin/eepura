<sentence id="0">Flutamide in the treatment of hirsutism : long-term clinical effects , endocrine changes , and androgen receptor behavior .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : To investigate the long-term effects of treatment with low doses of flutamide on clinical and hormonal parameters , as well as on the androgen receptor status , in hirsute women .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">DESIGN : Eighteen hirsute patients with regular menses were studied basally and during treatment with 125 mg flutamide , three times per day for 12 months .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Barrier or intrauterine contraception was used during the study in sexually active women .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Safety parameters were assessed throughout the study .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hirsutism , graded by the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score , and hormonal parameters were evaluated basally and at 4-month intervals during treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH stimulation tests were performed before and after 3 to 4 months of therapy .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , the concentration of androgen receptors in mononuclear leukocytes was measured , in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle , basally and after 4 months of flutamide treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">RESULTS : Flutamide was well tolerated in all women , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">with the</cue> noticeable exception of one patient who presented increased serum transaminase after 8 months of therapy</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Hirsutism markedly improved in all women during the treatment ( Ferriman-Gallwey score after 1 year : 4.1 +/- 0.5 versus 14.1 +/- 0.9 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">A reduction of serum androgens was found , whereas <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> change was observed in either basal or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropins or in the cortisol and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone response to ACTH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Cycles remained ovulatory .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Before treatment , the number of androgen receptors was higher in the luteal than in the follicular phase .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">This rhythmic differentiation disappeared after the patients had been given the antiandrogen drug .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">CONCLUSIONS : Flutamide is effective in the treatment of hirsutism but requires constant surveillance of liver function .</sentence>
<sentence id="15"><scope type="spec" id="2"> Androgen receptor blockade <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be potentiated by a reduction of serum androgens</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Flutamide affects androgen receptor behavior during the menstrual cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">The meaning of this finding remains to be elucidated .</sentence>
