<sentence id="0">[ Glucocorticoid receptors on human peripheral mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leucocytes : changes in patients with yang-deficiency ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It was found that , in former works , the glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) on peripheral mixed leucocytes in patients with Yang-deficiency were decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this work , the mixed leucocytes were further separated into mononuclear ( MNL ) and polymorphonuclear ( PML ) leucocytes , and GCR were determined in each part of leucocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">GCR on MNL and PML in 6 Yang deficient patients were 3473 +/- 413 and 4433 +/- 651 sites/cell respectively , statistically significant from the normal control group ( 4462 +/- 962 and 5622 +/- 782 sites/cell respectively , P less than 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">GCR on MNL , PML and mixed leucocytes in 5 patients were determined simultaneously , and all lowered from the control group .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results were 3369 +/- 370 , 4986 +/- 419 and 4524 +/- 852 sites/cell respectively , with the lowest GCR on MNL and highest on PML .</sentence>
