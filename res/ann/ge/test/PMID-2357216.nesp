<sentence id="0">Protein kinase inhibitor H-7 blocks accumulation of unspliced mRNA of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Rex , the post-transcriptional regulator of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , is known to induce accumulation of the unspliced viral gag-pol mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Rex is a phosphoprotein found in the cell nucleolus , whose function <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be regulated by its localization and phosphorylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have examined the role of phosphorylation on Rex function by using a protein kinase inhibitor , H-7 [ 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Treatment of an HTLV-I infected human T-cell line with H-7 blocked specifically accumulation of the unspliced gag-pol mRNA , resulting in the decreased Gag protein synthesis that corresponds with the decreased in vivo phosphorylation of Rex .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , other viral and cellular products have <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> been influenced by the level of H-7 used</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , the phosphorylation of Rex is required for the viral RNA partition of HTLV-I .</sentence>
