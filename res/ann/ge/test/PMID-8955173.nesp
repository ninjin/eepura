<sentence id="0">Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB via T cell receptor requires a Raf kinase and Ca2+ influx .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Functional synergy between Raf and calcineurin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Signals transduced via the TCR activate the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , which , in turn , is critical to the transcriptional induction of many genes important for the proliferation and expression of a differentiated phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Treatment of T cells with the protein kinase C activator PMA in combination with Ca2+ ionophores mimics this process , and the two agents are often substituted for TCR stimulation , bypassing the TCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we identify intracellular signaling components involved in activation of NF-kappaB following TCR stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">TCR signaling was triggered by treating Jurkat T cells with PHA or anti-CD3 Abs , and NF-kappaB activation was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and/or by kappaB-dependent reporter assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Contrary to the idea that protein kinase C is involved in TCR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB , high doses of staurosporine did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> interfere with activation of NF-kappaB by PHA</scope> , while the same dose of staurosporine completely blocked activation by PMA .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">PHA-induced kappaB-dependent reporter activity was , however , effectively blocked by a dominant negative form of Raf-1 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a critical role for a Raf kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The TCR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB was also dependent on a Ca2+ influx , because the Ca2+ channel blocker , SK&F 96365 , as well as other agents that prevented the Ca2+ influx , inhibited NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Cotransfection of a constitutively active form of calcineurin largely substituted for the Ca2+ requirement and reversed the blockade by SK&F 96365 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Consistent with these observations , coexpression of constitutively active forms of Raf-1 and calcineurin synergistically induced kappaB-dependent reporter activity , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a physiologically relevant functional interaction between the kinase and the phosphatase</scope> .</sentence>
