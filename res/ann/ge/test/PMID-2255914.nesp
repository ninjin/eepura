<sentence id="1">A fusion complementary DNA in the T cell line HSB-2 elucidates a provocative mechanism for the disruption of the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> hematopoietic transcription factor SCL</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The fusion cDNA results from an interstitial deletion between a previously <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue> locus</scope> , SIL ( SCL interrupting locus ) , and the 5' untranslated region of SCL .</sentence>
