<sentence id="0">Transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates inducible Oct-2 gene expression in precursor B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The POU transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 regulate the activity of octamer-dependent promoters , including those that direct transcription from rearranged immunoglobulin genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Unlike Oct-1 , which is constitutively expressed in many cell types , Oct-2 expression is restricted primarily to B lymphocytes and can be induced in precursor B cells by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the precise factors that mediate this induction mechanism remain <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , we monitored Oct-2 expression in cells arrested for the activation of NF-kappaB , an LPS-responsive member of the Rel transcription factor family .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Despite stimulation with LPS , disruption of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in precursor B cells led to the loss of inducible Oct-2 DNA binding activity in vitro and the suppression of Oct-2-directed transcription in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This biochemical defect correlated with a specific block to Oct-2 gene expression at the level of transcription , whereas the expression of Oct-1 was unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The finding that Oct-2 is under NF-kappaB control highlights an important cross-talk mechanism involving two distinct transcription factor families that regulate B lymphocyte function .</sentence>
