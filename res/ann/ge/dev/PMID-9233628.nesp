<sentence id="0">Involvement of Rel , Fos , and Jun proteins in binding activity to the IL-2 promoter CD28 response element/AP-1 sequence in human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD28 is an important costimulatory molecule in the activation of human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Costimulation of T cells through both the Ag receptor and CD28 leads to high level IL-2 production , which is vital to the development of an immune response in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Previous reports have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> the CD28 stimulation contributes to the activation of the IL-2 promoter by up-regulating the activity of several transcription factors , including AP-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/Rel family members as well as an uncharacterized transcription factor called CD28 response complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">While several lines of investigation have <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that NF-kappaB/Rel family members make up the CD28 response complex transcription factor</scope> , other work has <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> supported this conclusion</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Recent studies <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> function independently</scope> but works instead in conjunction with the adjacent promoter proximal AP-1-binding site</scope> and this hypothesis is confirmed here .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Also in the current study , binding activity to the CD28RE/AP-1 sequence of the IL-2 promoter is evaluated .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Although four specific complexes can be detected binding to this sequence , only one of these complexes is specific for both the CD28RE and the adjacent AP-1 site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Of the NF-kappaB/Rel family members tested , this CD28RE/AP-1-specific complex contains predominantly c-Rel , despite the fact that both p50 and RelA can efficiently bind to the CD28RE .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">c-Fos and c-Jun are also found in this CD28RE/AP-1-specific complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> functional complexes encompassing both the CD28RE and the AP-1-binding sites influence IL-2 promoter activity in CD28-costimulated T cells</scope> .</sentence>
