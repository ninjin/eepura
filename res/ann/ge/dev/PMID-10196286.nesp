<sentence id="0">Role of cellular tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors in NF-kappaB activation and lymphocyte transformation by herpesvirus Saimiri STP .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The STP oncoproteins of the herpesvirus saimiri ( HVS ) subgroup A strain 11 and subgroup C strain 488 are now found to be stably associated with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor ( TRAF ) 1 , 2 , or 3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Mutational analyses identified residues of PXQXT/S in STP-A11 as critical for TRAF association .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , a somewhat divergent region of STP-C488 is critical for TRAF association .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutational analysis also revealed that STP-C488 induced NF-kappaB activation that was correlated with its ability to associate with TRAFs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The HVS STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was deficient in human T-lymphocyte transformation to interleukin-2-independent growth but showed wild-type phenotype for marmoset T-lymphocyte transformation in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The STP-C488 P10-->R mutant was also defective in Rat-1 fibroblast transformation , and fibroblast cell transformation was blocked by a TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data implicate TRAFs in STP-C488-mediated transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Other factors are implicated in immortalization of common marmoset T lymphocytes and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> also be critical in the transformation of human lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts</scope> .</sentence>
