<sentence id="0">Regulation of jun and fos gene expression in human monocytes by the macrophage colony-stimulating factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) is required for the growth and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the signaling events responsible for these effects remain unclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The present studies have examined the effects of M-CSF on potential signaling pathways involving expression of the jun and fos early response genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in resting human peripheral blood monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment of these cells with 10(3) units/ml human recombinant M-CSF was associated with rapid and transient increases in c-jun mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Nuclear run-on assays and mRNA stability studies demonstrated that M-CSF regulates c-jun expression by both an increase in transcription rate and a prolongation in the half-life of c-jun transcripts .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">M-CSF treatment was also associated with a rapid induction of the jun-B gene , although expression of this gene was prolonged compared to that of c-jun .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We further demonstrate that M-CSF increases c-fos mRNA levels in human monocytes through control at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Maximal induction of the c-fos gene was followed by that for the fos-B gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Moreover , M-CSF-induced expression of the fos-related gene , fra-1 , was delayed compared to that for both c-fos and fos-B .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Taken together , the results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> M-CSF treatment is associated with differential activation of multiple members of the jun/fos family and that expression of these genes <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> contribute to nuclear signaling mechanisms that regulate a specific program of monocyte differentiation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
