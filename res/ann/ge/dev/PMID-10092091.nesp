<sentence id="0">NF-kappaB regulates Fas/APO-1/CD95- and TCR- mediated apoptosis of T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis by apoptosis is a critical regulatory mechanism in the normal immune system .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The transcription factor NF-kappaB has been shown to play a role in protecting cells against death mediated by TNF We show here that NF-kappaB also has a role in regulating Fas/APO-1/CD95-mediated death , a major pathway of peripheral T cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Transfection of Jurkat cells with the NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 confers resistance against Fas-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Reciprocally , inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor or a dominant form of the NF-kappaB inhibitor , IkappaB , makes the cells more susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by a soluble peptide inhibitor rendered a T cell hybridoma more susceptible to TCR-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Correspondingly , transfection of p50 and p65 provided considerable protection from TCR-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These observations were corroborated by studies on Fas-mediated death in primary T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Concanavalin A-activated cycling T cell blasts from mice that are transgenic for the dominant IkappaB molecule have increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis , associated with a down-regulation of NF-kappaB complexes in the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , blocking TNF , itself a positive regulator of NF-kappaB , with neutralizing antibodies renders the cells more susceptible to anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In summary , our results provide <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">compelling evidence</cue> that NF-kappaB protects against Fas-mediated death and <scope type="spec" id="1"> is <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to be an important regulator of T cell homeostasis and tolerance</scope></scope> .</sentence>
