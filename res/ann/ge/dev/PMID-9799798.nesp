<sentence id="0">Transcriptional regulation of lysosomal acid lipase in differentiating monocytes is mediated by transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) is a hydrolase required for the cleavage of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides derived from plasma lipoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is shown here that during monocyte to macrophage differentiation , the expression of LAL-mRNA is induced .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This induction is dependent on protein kinase C activity and protein synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The cell type-specific increase in LAL expression is further investigated in the THP-1 cell line with respect to transcriptional regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiates into macrophage-like cells when treated with phorbol esters .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In order to determine the cis-acting elements necessary for both basal and phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA)-enhanced promoter activity , we performed deletion analysis and reporter gene assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A PMA responsive element has been identified between -182 bp and -107 bp upstream of the major transcription start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that differentiation dependent increase of lysosomal acid lipase ( LAL ) expression in THP-1 cells is mediated by a concerted action of Sp1 and AP-2</scope> .</sentence>
