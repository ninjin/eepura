<sentence id="0">IL-4 Inhibits TGF-==beta==-Mediated iTreg Commitment</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-4 induces differentiation of naive T cells , upon antigen encounter , into the Th2 cell lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We therefore asked <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-==beta = = induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-==beta = = and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-==beta====-==mediated induction of FOXP3 expression ( Figure 5A ) in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4 , as it was previously observed [ 3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , at low concentration , IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Of note , GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-==beta = = at high IL-4 concentration ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="1">The IL-4==-==mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> caused by interferences of the receptor signaling</scope> , because <scope type="neg" id="2">the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-==beta = =</scope> , which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-==beta = = signaling were functional under these conditions ( Figure 5C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3 , whereas FOXP3 decreased , which is consistent with the mRNA analysis ( Figure 5D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , injection of IL-4 into wild-type B6 mice decreased the inducible or natural Treg number in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="10"><scope type="spec" id="4"> A distinction of the Treg subsets is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</scope></cue></scope> , because recently activated iTreg cells also express surface CD25 .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We used complexes of recombinant mouse IL-4 ( rmIL-4 ) plus anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) , which have been shown to dramatically increase the potency of the cytokine in vivo [ 19 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In these mice , the percentage of CD4+CD25+ and FOXP3+ T cells dramatically decreased when the antibody-cytokine immune complexes were injected ( Figure S2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Upon administration of rmIL-4 plus anti-IL-4 mAb complexes , the total number of CD4+CD25+ T cell , as well as the Foxp3+ T cells diminished by half ( Figure S2G and S2H ) , confirming that the lower percentage was <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> due to an increase in the CD4+CD25==- = = cells , but a real decrease of CD4+CD25+ T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">In conclusion , IL-4 negatively regulates the natural or inducible Treg cell turnover not only in vitro but also in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells , we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells ( nTreg cells ) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In already-existing Treg cells , IL-4 <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">failed</cue> to inhibit FOXP3 expression ( Figure S3A ) , and the suppressive capacity was <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> altered</scope> ( Figure S3C )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure</scope> ( Figure S3B ) .</sentence>
