<sentence id="0">Thymocytes control the CD4 gene differently from mature T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We analyzed the activity of the enhancer , the promoter and the silencer of the human CD4 gene during T cell development using transgenic mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Immunofluorescence studies on thymic populations of mice carrying transgenes in various combinations of these regulatory DNA elements revealed that thymocytes control the CD4 gene in a different manner than mature peripheral T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The 5'-positive regulatory unit , consisting of the promoter and the 5' enhancer , is already active at the CD4-CD8-double-negative ( DN ) stage of development .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , its activity becomes lower in the double-positive and a fraction of the CD4+ CD8int/- cell population , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> an additional enhancer , located in <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">either</cue> the first or the third intron of the CD4 gene</scope> , is required for CD4 gene expression in this population</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The other studied regulatory element is the minimal CD4 silencer which inhibits CD4 gene expression in peripheral CD8 T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This silencer is inactive in the most immature DN thymocytes , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">probably</cue> use a distinct silencer mechanism to down-regulate CD4 gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Unexpectedly , the CD4 silencer is also active in CD4+ CD8int/- cells of the thymus , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">implying</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="4"> an anti-silencer <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be required to resume CD4 expression in this cell population</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Altogether , the CD4 gene is regulated by several positive and negative regulatory mechanisms which come into play in a developmentally coordinated manner .</sentence>
