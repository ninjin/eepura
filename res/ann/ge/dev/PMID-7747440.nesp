<sentence id="0">Epstein-Barr virus replicative gene transcription during de novo infection of human thymocytes : simultaneous early expression of BZLF-1 and its repressor RAZ .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is known to infect B cells and epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We and others have shown that EBV can also infect a subset of thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Infection of thymocytes was accompanied by the appearance of linear EBV genome within 8 hr of infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="0">Circularization of the EBV genome was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This is in contrast to the infection in B cells where the genome can circularize within 24 hr of infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The appearance of the BamHI ZLF-1 gene product , ZEBRA , by RT-PCR , was observed within 8 hr of infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The appearance of a novel fusion transcript ( RAZ ) , which comprised regions of the BZLF-1 locus and the adjacent BRLF-1 locus , was detected by RT-PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">ZEBRA protein was also identified in infected thymocytes by immunoprecipitation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , we demonstrated that the EBNA-1 gene in infected thymocytes was transcribed from the Fp promoter , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> from the Cp/Wp promoter which is used in latently infected B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Transcripts encoding gp350/220 , the major coat protein of EBV , were identified , but we did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> find any evidence of transcription from the LMP-2A or EBER-1 loci in infected thymocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that de novo EBV infection of thymocytes differs from infection of B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The main difference is that with thymocytes , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4"><cue type="spec" id="5">no</cue> evidence</cue> could be found that the virus ever circularizes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Rather , EBV remains in a linear configuration from which replicative genes are transcribed .</sentence>
