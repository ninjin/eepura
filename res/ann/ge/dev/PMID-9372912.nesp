<sentence id="0">Regulation of Id3 cell cycle function by Cdk-2-dependent phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The functions of basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors in activating differentiation-linked gene expression and in inducing G1 cell cycle arrest are negatively regulated by members of the Id family of HLH proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These bHLH antagonists are induced during a mitogenic signalling response , and they function by sequestering their bHLH targets in inactive heterodimers that <scope type="neg" id="0">are <cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to bind to specific gene regulatory ( E box ) sequences</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , cyclin E-Cdk2- and cyclin A-Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of a single conserved serine residue ( Ser5 ) in Id2 has been shown to occur during late G1-to-S phase transition of the cell cycle , and this neutralizes the function of Id2 in abrogating E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro ( E.Hara , M.Hall , and G.Peters , EMBO J.16:332-342 , 1997 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We now show that an analogous cell-cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Id3 alters the specificity of Id3 for abrogating both E-box-dependent bHLH homo- or heterodimer complex formation in vitro and E-box-dependent reporter gene function in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , compared with wild-type Id3 , an Id3 Asp5 mutant ( mimicking phosphorylation ) is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">unable</cue> to promote cell cycle S phase entry in transfected fibroblasts</scope> , whereas an Id3 Ala5 mutant ( ablating phosphorylation ) displays an activity significantly greater than that of wild-type Id3 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation therefore provides a switch during late G1-to-S phase that both nullifies an early G1 cell cycle regulatory function of Id3 and modulates its target bHLH specificity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data also demonstrate that the ability of Id3 to promote cell cycle S phase entry is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> simply a function of its ability to modulate bHLH heterodimer-dependent gene expression</scope> and establish a biologically important mechanism through which Cdk2 and Id-bHLH functions are integrated in the coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation .</sentence>
