<sentence id="0">Homodimerization of the human interleukin 4 receptor alpha chain induces Cepsilon germline transcripts in B cells in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of the interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 play a critical role in inducing Cepsilon germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in human B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The IL-4 receptor ( IL-4R ) in B cells is composed of two chains , the IL-4-binding IL-4Ralpha chain , which is shared with the IL-13R , and the IL-2Rgamma ( gammac ) chain , which is shared with IL-7R , IL-9R , and IL-15R .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">IL-4 induces Cepsilon germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in B cells from patients with gammac chain deficiency .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Induction of Cepsilon germline transcripts by IL-4 in B cells that <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> the gammac chain</scope> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> involve signaling via the IL-13R</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Alternatively , the IL-4Ralpha chain <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> transduce intracellular signals that lead to Cepsilon gene transcription independently of its association with other chains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that ligand-induced homodimerization of chimeric surface receptors consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the erythropoietin receptor and of the intracellular domain of IL-4Ralpha induces Janus kinase 1 ( Jak1 ) activation , STAT6 activation , and Cepsilon germline transcripts in human B cell line BJAB .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Disruption of the Jak1-binding proline-rich Box1 region of IL-4Ralpha abolished signaling by this chimeric receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , B cells transfected with a chimeric CD8alpha/IL-4Ralpha receptor , which is expressed on the cell surface as a homodimer , constitutively expressed Cepsilon germline transcripts .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that homodimerization of the IL-4Ralpha chain is sufficient to transduce Jak1-dependent intracellular signals that lead to IgE isotype switching</scope> .</sentence>
