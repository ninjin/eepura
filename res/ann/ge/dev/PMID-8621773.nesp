<sentence id="0">Monocytic cell type-specific transcriptional induction of collagenase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interstitial collagenase ( MMP-1 ) , a metalloproteinase produced by resident and inflammatory cells during connective tissue turnover , cleaves type I collagen fibrils .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This catalytic event is rate limiting in remodeling of tissues rich in fibrillar collagen such as the skin and lungs .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The regulation of collagenase expression is cell-type specific ; bacterial LPS and zymosan , a yeast cell wall derivative , are potent inducers of collagenase expression in macrophages , but do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> alter fibroblast collagenase expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Since <scope type="neg" id="1">promoter elements controlling collagenase transcription in monocytic cells have <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> been previously defined</scope> , we sought to delineate responsive cis-acting elements of the collagenase promoter in transiently transfected human ( U937 ) and murine ( J774 ) monocytic cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Deletion constructs containing as little as 72 bp of 5' -flanking sequence of the collagenase promoter were sufficient for LPS- or zymosan-mediated transcriptional induction , whereas phorbol inducibility exhibited an absolute requirement for upstream elements including the polyoma enhancer A-binding protein-3 site ( -83 to -91 ) and TTCA sequence ( -102 to -105 ) in both monocytic cells and fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutagenesis of the activator protein-1 [ AP-1 ] site at -72 abolished basal promoter activity and LPS/zymosan inducibility , while mutagenesis of an NF-kappaB-like site at -20 to -10 had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Nuclear extracts from LPS- and zymosan-treated cells showed strong AP-1 activity by gel-shift analysis , and supershift analysis showed the AP-1 complexes contained specific members of both the jun and fos gene families .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> , in contrast to most LPS effects , AP-1 , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> nuclear factor-kappaB</scope> , mediates LPS induction of collagenase transcription in macrophagelike cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , as compared to regulation by phorbol ester , collagenase induction in monocytic cells by cell wall derivatives of bacteria or yeast is largely independent of upstream promoter sequences .</sentence>
