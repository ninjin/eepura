<sentence id="0">The role of p16 in the E2F-dependent thymidine kinase regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The role of alterations of the MTS1 tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 9p21 , which encodes p16 , the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent-kinase-4 and 6 , in tumorigenesis is <cue type="spec" id="0">not</cue> yet clear</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 prevents its interaction with the transcription factor E2F , which subsequently promotes the expression of S phase regulated genes , such as thymidine kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although a role of p16 in this regulation has been presumed , there is <scope type="spec" id="2"> <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1"><cue type="spec" id="2">no</cue> proof</scope></cue> so far that loss of this tumor suppressor gene really affects E2F-mediated regulations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We investigated the regulation of thymidine kinase in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes and in the p16-negative human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines , MOLT-4 and CEM .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Compared to normal lymphocytes , MOLT-4 and CEM cells exhibited an altered cell cycle regulation of thymidine kinase , a much higher intracellular activity of this enzyme , and higher thymidine kinase mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transient expression of p16 in normal human lymphocytes caused arrest in G1 , but was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> effect on the cell growth of MOLT-4 and CEM cells</scope> , although all of them express functional retinoblastoma protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Nevertheless , in the two leukemia cell lines transient overexpression of p16 reestablished the normal regulation of thymidine kinase , paralleled by an increase of the underphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein and decrease of free E2F bound to its motif in the thymidine kinase promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We demonstrate that loss of p16 causes upregulation of this DNA precursor pathway enzyme via activation of E2F by a mechanism involving retinoblastoma protein .</sentence>
