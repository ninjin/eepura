<sentence id="0">Silencing of human fetal globin expression is impaired in the absence of the adult beta-globin gene activator protein EKLF .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Globin genes are subject to tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A switch from human fetal (gamma)-to adult (beta)-globin expression occurs within erythroid precursor cells of the adult lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene , erythroid Kruppel-like factor ( EKLF ) , is required for expression of the beta-globin gene in mice , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">presumably</cue> through interaction with a high-affinity binding site in the proximal promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To examine the role of EKLF in the developmental regulation of the human gamma-globin gene we interbred EKLF heterozygotes ( +/- ) with mice harboring a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We find that in the absence of EKLF , while human beta-globin expression is dramatically reduced , gamma-globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5-fold .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Impaired silencing of gamma-globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma-globin to beta-globin switch .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage-specific interaction between the beta-globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma-globin gene .</sentence>
