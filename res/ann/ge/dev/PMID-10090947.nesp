<sentence id="0">Constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in primary adult T-cell leukemia cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) is an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The viral protein Tax induces the activation and nuclear translocalization of transcription factor NF-kappaB , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which is <cue type="spec" id="0">proposed</cue> to play a crucial role in the transformation of T cells by HTLV-I</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , <scope type="neg" id="1">the HTLV-I genes including Tax are <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> expressed significantly in primary leukemic cells from ATL patients</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we examined the basis for NF-kappaB activation in freshly isolated leukemic cells from ATL patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that leukemic cells from ATL patients , like HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines , display constitutive NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and increased degradation of IkappaBalpha ( an inhibitor of NF-kappaB ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Whereas the NF-kappaB binding activity in Tax-expressing T-cell lines consisted mostly of p50/c-Rel , fresh ATL samples contained p50/p50 and p50/p65 heterodimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">One T-cell line derived from ATL leukemic cells , TL-Om1 , displayed constitutive NF-kappaB activity , as well as enhanced degradation of IkappaBalpha , despite the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> of detectable Tax expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Interestingly , the NF-kappaB in TL-Om1 consists of p50/p50 and p50/p65 like that in fresh primary leukemic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that activation of NF-kappaB occurs through a Tax-independent mechanism in leukemic cells of ATL patients , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possibly</cue> due to differential NF-kappaB subunit activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
