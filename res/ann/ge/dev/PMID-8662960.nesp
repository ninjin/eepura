<sentence id="1">In vivo protein-DNA interactions of the human beta-globin locus in erythroid cells expressing the fetal or the adult globin gene program .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To characterize the protein-DNA interactions important for the developmental control of the human beta-globin locus , we analyzed by in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting erythroid cells expressing either the fetal or the adult globin developmental program .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the locus control region ( LCR ) of the beta-globin locus , in vivo footprints on NF-E2 ( or AP-1 ) and GATA-1 motifs remained the same regardless of <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> the fetal <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> the adult globin genes</scope> are expressed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , in vivo footprints on GT ( CACCC ) motifs differed between the cells expressing the fetal or the adult globin program .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In promoter regions , the actively transcribed genes demonstrated extensive and consistent footprints over the canonical elements , such as CACCC and CCAAT motifs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The adult globin expressing cells displayed more extensive footprints than the fetal globin expressing cells in the 3' regulatory sequences of both the Agamma- and the beta-globin genes , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a role of these 3' elements in beta-globin gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the bulk of protein-DNA interactions that underlies the developmental control of globin genes takes place in the gamma- and beta-globin gene promoters , and that GT motifs of the beta-globin locus LCR <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> play a role in the developmental regulation of human beta-globin gene expression , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">perhaps</cue> by increasing the probability of interaction of the LCR holocomplex with the fetal or the adult globin gene</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
