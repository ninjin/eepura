<sentence id="0">Evidence for distinct intracellular signaling pathways in CD34+ progenitor to dendritic cell differentiation from a human cell line model .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Intracellular signals that mediate differentiation of pluripotent hemopoietic progenitors to dendritic cells ( DC ) are largely undefined .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have previously shown that protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation ( with phorbol ester ( PMA ) alone ) specifically induces differentiation of primary human CD34+ hemopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) to mature DC .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We now find that cytokine-driven ( granulocyte-macrophage CSF and TNF-alpha ) CD34+ HPC-->DC differentiation is preferentially blocked by inhibitors of PKC activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To further identify intracellular signals and downstream events important in CD34+ HPC-->DC differentiation we have characterized a human leukemic cell line model of this process .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The CD34+ myelomonocytic cell line KG1 differentiates into dendritic-like cells in response to granulocyte-macrophage CSF plus TNF-alpha , or PMA ( with or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> the calcium ionophore ionomycin , or TNF-alpha )</scope> , with different stimuli mediating different aspects of the process .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Phenotypic DC characteristics of KG1 dendritic-like cells include morphology ( loosely adherent cells with long neurite processes ) , MHC I+/MHC IIbright/CD83+/CD86+/CD14- surface Ag expression , and RelB and DC-CK1 gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Functional DC characteristics include fluid phase macromolecule uptake ( FITC-dextran ) and activation of resting T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Comparison of KG1 to the PMA-unresponsive subline KG1a reveals differences in expression of TNF receptors 1 and 2 ; PKC isoforms alpha , beta I , beta II , and mu ; and RelB , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that these components/pathways are important for DC differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Together , these findings demonstrate that <scope type="spec" id="2"> cytokine <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> phorbol ester</scope> stimulation of KG1 is a model of human CD34+ HPC to DC differentiation and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that specific intracellular signaling pathways mediate specific events in DC lineage commitment</scope> .</sentence>
