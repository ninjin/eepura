<sentence id="0">Activation of pp90rsk and early growth response-1 gene expression by pokeweed mitogen in human B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The present studies have examined the effects of pokeweed mitogen ( PWM ) on the induction of early growth response-1 gene ( EGR-1 ) in normal human B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PWM regulates EGR-1 gene expression by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Transient transfection assays with EGR-1 promoter fragments linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene demonstrated that PWM induced EGR-1 transcription is conferred by the CArG motif ( C C[AT]6GG ) in the EGR-1 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The results further demonstrated the activation of S6 kinase ( pp90rsk ) , evidenced by phosphorylation of S6 and serum response factor ( SRF ) peptides , in PWM treated B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Taken together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that PWM is able to initiate an intracytoplasmic signalling cascade and EGR-1 induction in normal human B cells</scope> .</sentence>
