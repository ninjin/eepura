<sentence id="0">Differential induction of the NF-AT complex during restimulation and the induction of T-cell anergy .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Stimulation of human CD4+ T-cell clones through the T-cell receptor ( TcR ) by high doses of specific peptide results in the induction of a long-lived state of nonresponsiveness that has been called anergy .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">During the induction of anergy , T cells are phenotypically similar to cells responding to an immunogenic stimulus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The amount of TcR at the cell surface is downmodulated , whereas the CD2 and CD25 receptors are increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When restimulated , however , anergic T cells <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">fail</cue> to up-regulate transcription of the IL-2 gene and in consequence do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> produce IL-2</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we have compared the ability of various transcription factors to bind to their appropriate site on DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Factors were isolated from the nuclei of T cells that were in the induction phase of anergy <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> were undergoing activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The pattern of binding activity in restimulated T cells is consistent with the pattern that has previously been shown to regulate T-cell-specific expression of the IL-2 and the beta chain of the TcR genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The measured binding to a TCF-1 site is the same in the nuclei of resting , activated , and anergized cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The inducible factors NK-kappa B , beta E2 , CD28RC , and AP-1 are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> expressed in resting cells and are twofold lower in anergized as compared with activated cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In contrast , anergic T cells express approximately eightfold lower amounts of NF-AT , a member of the class of inducible factors that regulates IL-2 gene transcription .</sentence>
