<sentence id="0">Overproduction of NFKB2 ( lyt-10 ) and c-Rel : a mechanism for HTLV-I Tax-mediated trans-activation via the NF-kappa B signalling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Molecular , biochemical and epidemiological evidence implicate HTLV-I as an etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Tax protein of HTLV-I , a positive transcriptional activator of HTLV-I gene expression , is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of cellular genes including GM-CSF , IL-2R alpha and IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">One of the cellular targets of the trans-activating effects of Tax is the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors , pleiotropic regulators of immunoregulatory , cytokine and viral gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this report , we demonstrate that NFKB2 ( lyt-10 ) and c-Rel are overexpressed in HTLV-I infected and Tax-expressing cells and , together , account for the majority of the constitutive NF-kappa B binding activity in these cells before and after PMA stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Most importantly , we show a Tax-dependent correlation between expression of NFKB2(p100) and processing to the DNA binding NFKB2(p52) form , induction of c-Rel , and trans-activation of NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the NFKB2 precursor is physically associated with c-Rel and with Tax in HTLV-I infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and , in conjunction with overexpression of c-Rel , NFKB2 alters the NF-kappa B signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV-I</scope> .</sentence>
