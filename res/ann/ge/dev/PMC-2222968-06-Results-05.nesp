<sentence id="0">GATA3 Is a Negative Regulator of FOXP3 Expression</sentence>
<sentence id="1">FOXP3 expression decreased once GATA3 expression is high ; therefore , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> role for GATA3</scope> in repressing FOXP3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Besides GATA3=='==s well-known positive effect on gene regulation , GATA3=='==s repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [ 2,21 ] , and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> GATA3 can directly inhibit FOXP3 induction</scope> , we transduced GATA3 or a truncated GATA3 lacking the DNA-binding domain in human primary CD4+CD45RA+ T cells using a TAT-fused , recombinantly expressed GATA3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After transduction , the cells were activated with soluble anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of TGF-==beta = = .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">TAT-GATA3 was successfully transduced in a homogeneous and dose-dependent manner into human CD4+ T cells ( Figure 7A , upper panel ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">TAT-GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner , whereas a DNA-binding domain truncated version ( TAT-==Delta==DBD-GATA3 ) did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells</scope> ( Figure 7A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , we analyzed the inhibitory effect of GATA3 on FOXP3 in transgenic DO11.10 mice , constitutively overexpressing GATA3 under the control of the CD2 locus control region ( DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The thymic selection into the CD4 lineage is largely intact in DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 ( RW Hendriks , unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These mice develop lymphomas at an older age , but <scope type="neg" id="4">signs of autoimmune disease were <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> described [ 22 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">To investigate the effect of GATA3 on iTreg , CD4+CD62L+CD25==- = = cells were isolated , activated with OVA in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">absence</cue> of TGF-==beta = =</scope> , and Foxp3 expression was analyzed after 4 d. The naive CD4+CD25==- = = cells were Foxp3==- = = ( unpublished data ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">As described for the human cells , TGF-==beta = = dramatically up-regulated Foxp3 in the DO11.10 littermate control mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In contrast , cells from the CD2-GATA3xDO11.10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF-==beta = = and OVA ( Figure 7B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">All mice produced similar amounts of TGF-==beta = = ; in addition , Smad7 was equally expressed [ 23 ] in T cells of both mice strains ( Figure 7C ) , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating</cue> intact TGF-==beta = = signaling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Taken together , these results demonstrated a repressive role of IL-4-induced GATA3 transcription factor in the generation of iTreg cells .</sentence>
