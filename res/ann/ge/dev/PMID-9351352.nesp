<sentence id="0">Dysregulation of monocytic nuclear factor-kappa B by oxidized low-density lipoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) / Rel transcription factors <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be involved in atherosclerosis</scope> , as <scope type="spec" id="1"> is <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> by the presence of activated NF-kappa B in human atherosclerotic lesions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) on the NF-kappa B system in human THP-1 monocytic cells as well as adherent monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our results demonstrate that short-term incubation of these cells with oxLDL activated p50/p65 containing NF-kappa B dimers and induced the expression of the target gene IL-8 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This activation of NF-kappa B was inhibited by the antioxidant and H2O2 scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor PSI .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The oxLDL-induced NF-kappa B activation was accompanied by an initial depletion of I kappa B-alpha followed by a slight transient increase in the level of this inhibitor protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , long-term treatment with oxLDL prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced depletion of I kappa B-alpha , accompanied by an inhibition of both NF-kappa B activation and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These observations provide additional evidence that oxLDL is a potent modulator of gene expression and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="3"> (dys)regulation of NF-kappa B/Rel is <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> to play an important role in atherogenesis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
