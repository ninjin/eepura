<sentence id="0">Induction of cytokine expression in leukocytes by binding of thrombin-stimulated platelets .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Activated platelets tether and activate myeloid leukocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> relevance of this mechanism in acute myocardial infarction ( AMI )</scope> , we examined cytokine induction by leukocyte-platelet adhesion and the occurrence of leukocyte-platelet conjugates in patients with AMI .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS AND RESULTS : We obtained peripheral venous blood samples in 20 patients with AMI before and daily for 5 days after direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) and in 20 patients undergoing elective PTCA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Throughout the study period , CD41 immunofluorescence of leukocytes ( flow cytometry ) revealed increased leukocyte-platelet adhesion in patients with AMI compared with control patients ( mean +/- SE of fluorescence [ channels ] before PTCA : 77 +/- 16 versus 35 +/- 9 ; P = .003 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In vitro , thrombin-stimulated fixed platelets bound to neutrophils and monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Within 2 hours , this resulted in increased mRNA for interleukin (IL),1 beta , IL-8 , and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in unfractionated leukocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">After 4 hours , IL-1 beta and IL-8 concentration of the cell-free supernatant had increased by 268 +/- 36 % and 210 +/- 7 % , respectively , and cellular MCP-1 content had increased by 170 +/- 8 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Addition of activated platelets to adherent monocytes had a similar effect and was associated with nuclear factor-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Inhibition of binding by anti-P selectin antibodies reduced the effect of activated platelets on cytokine production .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSIONS : In patients with AMI , leukocyte-platelet adhesion is increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Binding of activated platelets induces IL-1 beta , IL-8 , and MCP-1 in leukocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that leukocyte-platelet adhesion contributes to the regulation of inflammatory responses in AMI</scope> .</sentence>
