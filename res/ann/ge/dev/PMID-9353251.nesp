<sentence id="0">CD30-dependent degradation of TRAF2 : implications for negative regulation of TRAF signaling and the control of cell survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD30 is a cell-surface receptor that can augment lymphocyte activation and survival through its ability to induce the transcription factor NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CD30 , however , has also been implicated in the induction of apoptotic cell death of lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that one of the effects of CD30 signal transduction is to render cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This sensitization is dependent on the TRAF-binding sites within the CD30 cytoplasmic domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">One of the proteins that binds to these sites is TRAF2 , a signal transduction molecule that is also utilized by TNFR1 to mediate the activation of several downstream kinases and transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">During CD30 signal transduction , we found that binding of TRAF2 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 results in the rapid depletion of TRAF2 and the associated protein TRAF1 by proteolysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> a model in which CD30 limits its own ability to transduce cell survival signals through signal-coupled depletion of TRAF2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Depletion of intracellular TRAF2 and its coassociated proteins also increased the sensitivity of the cell to undergoing apoptosis during activation of death-inducing receptors such as TNFR1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Consistent with this hypothesis , expression of a dominant-negative form of TRAF2 was found to potentiate TNFR1-mediated death .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These studies provide a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> mechanism through which CD30 , as well as other TRAF-binding members of the TNFR superfamily , can negatively regulate cell survival</scope> .</sentence>
