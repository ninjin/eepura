<sentence id="0">Paternal expression of WT1 in human fibroblasts and lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Wilms ' tumor suppressor gene ( WT1 ) was previously identified as being imprinted , with frequent maternal expression in human placentae and fetal brains .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We examined the allele-specific expression of WT1 in cultured human fibroblasts from 15 individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Seven of 15 fibroblast lines were heterozygous for polymorphic alleles , and the expression patterns were variable , i.e. , equal , unequal or monoallelic paternal expression in three , two and two cases , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Exclusive paternal expression of WT1 was also shown in non-cultured peripheral lymphocytes from the latter two individuals .</sentence>
