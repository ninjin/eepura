<sentence id="0">A nongenomic mechanism for progesterone-mediated immunosuppression : inhibition of K+ channels , Ca2+ signaling , and gene expression in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The mechanism by which progesterone causes localized suppression of the immune response during pregnancy has remained <cue type="spec" id="0">elusive</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using human T lymphocytes and T cell lines , we show that progesterone , at concentrations found in the placenta , rapidly and reversibly blocks voltage-gated and calcium-activated K+ channels ( KV and KCa , respectively ) , resulting in depolarization of the membrane potential .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As a result , Ca2+ signaling and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)-driven gene expression are inhibited .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Progesterone acts distally to the initial steps of T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signal transduction , since it blocks sustained Ca2+ signals after thapsigargin stimulation , as well as oscillatory Ca2+ signals , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> the Ca2+ transient after TCR stimulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">K+ channel blockade by progesterone is specific ; other steroid hormones had little or <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect</scope> , although the progesterone antagonist RU 486 also blocked KV and KCa channels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Progesterone effectively blocked a broad spectrum of K+ channels , reducing both Kv1.3 and charybdotoxin-resistant components of KV current and KCa current in T cells , as well as blocking several cloned KV channels expressed in cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Progesterone had little or <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> effect on a cloned voltage-gated Na+ channel , an inward rectifier K+ channel , or on lymphocyte Ca2+ and Cl- channels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">propose</cue> that direct inhibition of K+ channels in T cells by progesterone contributes to progesterone-induced immunosuppression</scope> .</sentence>
