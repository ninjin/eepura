<sentence id="0">IL-10 inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in CD3-stimulated human peripheral T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-10 markedly reduces nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity induced in PBMC by stimulation with the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The inhibition is exerted specifically on the NF-kappa B/Rel activation induced by mAb OKT3 , and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> that produced by PMA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As judged by supershifting the DNA-protein complexes with Abs recognizing specific components of the NF-kappa B/Rel protein family , the p50/p65 ( Rel A ) heterodimeric form of NF-kappa B is primarily affected .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The maximal effect is observed at the IL-10 concentration of 20 U/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-10 inhibitory activity is exerted on T lymphocytes and is mediated by monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Indeed , monocytes pretreated with IL-10 are able so inhibit NF-kappa B nuclear activity in purified T lymphocytes stimulated with OKT3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="2"> <scope type="neg" id="1">Soluble factors do <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to be involved in the mechanism of inhibition</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">On the other hand , <scope type="neg" id="3">the up-regulation of CD80 Ag , found on monocytes obtained from PBMC incubated with OKT3 , is <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> detected after addition of IL-10</scope> , and the anti-CD28 mAb CLB-CD28/1 restores the NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in IL-10-inhibited lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Therefore , <scope type="spec" id="5"> the NF-kappa B/Rel inhibition <cue type="spec" id="5">might</cue> be ascribed to a <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">lack</cue> of cooperation between accessory cells and T lymphocytes</scope> , resulting from down-regulation of a costimulatory molecule , such as CD80 , produced by IL-10 on activated monocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our results demonstrate that IL-10 can inhibit the induction of NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in CD3-stimulated T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Since inappropriate activation of kappa B-driven genes has a physiopathologic role in a number of diseases , such as HIV infection , our findings support the <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">possibility</cue> of using this cytokine to suppress an undesirable activation of these transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
