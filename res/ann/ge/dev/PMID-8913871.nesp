<sentence id="0">Potent gene regulatory and antiproliferative activities of 20-methyl analogues of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The biological active form of vitamin D3 , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD ) , regulates cellular growth and differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This provides the hormone with an interesting therapeutic potential .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , hypercalcemia is a side effect , which is caused by VD 's classical action , the regulation of calcium homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This made the need for VD analogues with selectively increased cell regulatory properties .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Studies with 20-epi analogues pointed out the importance of the carbon-20 position and led to the development of 20-methyl derivatives of VD .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In this report the biological properties of the compounds ZK161422 and ZK157202 , which are 20-methyl- and 20-methyl-23-eneanalogues , respectively , have been analyzed in comparison with VD .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Both compounds show about 2-fold lower affinity to the VD receptor ( VDR ) than VD .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , compared to VD , their antiproliferative effect is up to 30-fold higher on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and even up to 300-fold higher on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Whereas the hypercalcemic effect for ZK157202 is also increased 10-fold , ZK161422 has the same calcium-mobilizing potency as VD .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Moreover , ZK161422 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> ZK157202</scope> , showed preference for gene activation from a promoter carrying a VD response element with a palindromic arrangement of two hexameric receptor binding sites spaced by 9 nucleotides ( IP9 ) <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> for activation from a response element formed by a direct repeat spaced by 3 nucleotides ( DR3 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This observation supports a model , in which promoter selectivity reflects the selectively increased antiproliferative effect of VD analogues .</sentence>
