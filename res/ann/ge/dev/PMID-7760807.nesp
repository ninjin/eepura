<sentence id="0">MIP1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) , a novel transcription factor expressed in hematopoietic cells that is crucial for transcription of the human MIP-1 alpha gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1 alpha ) and its human equivalent ( GOS19 , LD78 , or AT464 ) are members of the -C-C family of low-molecular-weight chemokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Secreted from activated T cells and macrophages , bone marrow-derived MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 inhibits primitive hematopoietic stem cells and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be involved in the homeostatic control of stem cell proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It also induces chemotaxis and inflammatory responses in mature cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms which control the expression of MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Previous work has shown that in Jurkat T cells , a set of widely expressed transcription factors ( the ICK-1 family ) affect the GOS19 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">One member , ICK-1A , behaves as a strong negative regulator .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In this communication , we provide evidence that the pathway of induction in the macrophage cell line U937 is different from that in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , we show that the ICK-1 binding site does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> confer negative regulation in U937 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We provide evidence for an additional binding site , the MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) site , which overlaps the ICK-1 site .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Interaction of nuclear extracts from various cell lines and tissue with the MNP site leads to the formation of fast-migrating protein-DNA complexes with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">A mutation of the MNP site which does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> abrogate ICK-1 binding</scope> inactivates the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that the MNP protein(s) binding at the MNP site constitutes a novel transcription factor(s) expressed in hematopoietic cells</scope> .</sentence>
