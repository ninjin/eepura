<sentence id="0">Cytokine rescue from glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in T cells is mediated through inhibition of IkappaBalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We previously reported that dexamethasone ( DEX ) , a synthetic glucocorticoid , causes apoptosis in mature Th cell lines , and that this induction of cell death is prevented by specific cytokines , namely , by IL-2 in Th1 cells and by IL-4 in Th2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now show that this differential rescue by specific cytokines in Th cells correlates with the level of IkappaBalpha that is regulated by DEX and cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In both cell types the cellular levels of IkappaBalpha mRNA and protein were evaluated by DEX treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , the DEX-mediated IkappaBalpha induction was completely inhibited by IL-2 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> IL-4</scope> , in Th1 cells , while the reverse profile was seen in Th2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In both cell types , the cytokine that inhibits the induction of IkappaBalpha by DEX , also rescues these cells from DEX-induced apoptosis , although the rescue cytokine is different in Th1 and Th2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">imply</cue> that T cells need to maintain a certain level of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in order to survive</scope> ; up- or down-regulation of nuclear NF kappaB through modulation of IkappaBalpha expression by cytokines or DEX <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> lead to cell survival or cell death , respectively</scope> .</sentence>
