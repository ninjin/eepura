<sentence id="0">Cell-specific bifunctional role of Jun oncogene family members on glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Interaction between protein kinase C (PKC)- and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated signaling is <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> by the ability of the PKC activating phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) to inhibit GR-dependent transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we report that this interference is cell specific , as TPA augmented dexamethasone-induced transcriptional activation of the MMTV LTR in several T cell lines but was inhibitory in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TPA-GR synergism was determined to have occurred at the GR-responsive element ( GRE ) level by functional analysis of deletion mutants or synthetic GRE oligonucleotides driving chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Synergism required an intact GR DNA-binding domain , whereas amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains were dispensable .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The effect was abrogated by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a role for PKC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Increased c-jun , jun-B , and jun-D expression above basal levels and increased transcriptional activity of AP-1/TPA responsive elements fused to chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase vectors were observed in T cells treated with TPA alone or in combination with dexamethasone .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The ability of Jun proteins to cooperate with GR in T cells has been investigated after transfection of c-jun , jun-B , or jun-D expression vectors , which augmented GR-dependent transcription from either MMTV LTR or GRE .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Conversely , c-jun and jun-B transfection blunted GR-dependent transcription in HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The presence of c-fos had a negative influence on GR function and correlated with the cell-specific synergistic or antagonistic activity of Jun with respect to GR ; high basal expression of c-fos as well as AP-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity were observed in HeLa cells , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore overexpression of exogenous c-fos has an inhibitory effect on GR-dependent transcription from GRE in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that Jun plays a bifunctional role on GR-dependent transcriptional activation of GRE , selecting either synergistic or antagonistic activity depending on the cell-specific microenvironment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In this regard , <scope type="spec" id="4"> intracellular levels of c-fos <cue type="spec" id="4">appear</cue> to be influential</scope> .</sentence>
