<sentence id="0">cAMP-dependent regulation of proenkephalin by JunD and JunB : positive and negative effects of AP-1 proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We demonstrate that JunD , a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex , activates transcription of the human proenkephalin gene in a fashion that is completely dependent upon the cAMP-dependent protein kinase , protein kinase A .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Activation of proenkephalin transcription by JunD is dependent upon a previously characterized cAMP- , phorbol ester- , and Ca(2+)-inducible enhancer , and JunD is shown to bind the enhancer as a homodimer .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Another component of the AP-1 transcription complex , JunB , is shown to inhibit activation mediated by JunD .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As a homodimer JunB is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to bind the enhancer</scope> ; however in the presence of c-Fos , high-affinity binding is observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , JunD is shown to activate transcription of genes linked to both cAMP and phorbol ester response elements in a protein kinase A-dependent fashion , further blurring the distinction between these response elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of an AP-1-related protein is regulated by the cAMP-dependent second-messenger pathway and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that JunD and other AP-1-related proteins <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> play an important role in the regulation of gene expression by cAMP-dependent intracellular signaling pathways</scope></scope> .</sentence>
