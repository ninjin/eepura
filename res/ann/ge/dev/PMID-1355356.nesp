<sentence id="0">Functional interaction between the two zinc finger domains of the v-erb A oncoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The v-erb A oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus is a mutated and virally transduced copy of a host cell gene encoding a thyroid hormone receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The protein expressed by the v-erb A oncogene binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the thyroid hormone receptor and the closely related retinoic acid receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The v-erb A protein has sustained two amino acid alterations within its DNA-binding domain relative to that of c-erb A , one of which , at serine 61 , is known to be important for v-erb A function in the neoplastic cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We report here that the second alteration , at threonine 78 , also plays an important , although more indirect , role : alteration of the sequence at threonine 78 such that it resembles that of c-erb A <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> act as an intragenic suppressor</scope> and can partially restore function to a v-erb A protein rendered defective due to a mutation at position 61 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Threonine 78 lies within the D-box of the v-erb A protein , <scope type="spec" id="2"> a region <cue type="spec" id="2">thought</cue> to mediate receptor-receptor dimerizations</scope> , and is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in physical proximity to the serine at position 61</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It therefore <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> that an indirect interaction occurs between these two sites and that this interaction is crucial for v-erb A function</scope> .</sentence>
