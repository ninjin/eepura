<sentence id="0">Activation of protein kinase C and elevation of cAMP interact synergistically to raise c-Fos and AP-1 activity in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have earlier found that in Jurkat cells activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) enhances the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) accumulation induced by adenosine receptor stimulation or activation of Gs. Here we have therefore examined the effect of the phorbol ester PMA ( phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ) which stimulates PKC and a combination of the adenosine receptor agonist NECA ( 5'-(N-ethyl)-carboxamido adenosine ) and forskolin to raise cAMP , on the levels of c-Fos and Jun and on the binding and transcriptional activity of the transcription factor , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PMA treatment caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in both c-Fos and Jun immunoreactivity in contrast to cAMP elevation that had only a slight effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both PMA and the combination of NECA and forskolin acted together either to increase ( c-Fos ) or decrease ( Jun ) protein levels as well as increasing AP-1 binding , as judged by gel-shift assay , and AP-1 transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore there was a clear-cut synergy between the PKC stimulator and the cAMP elevating agents .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of PKC and elevation of cAMP leads to an enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in a T-leukemia cell line , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the previously observed interaction between the parallel signal transduction pathways <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> have functional consequences at the level of gene transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
