<sentence id="0">Triggering of the human interleukin-6 gene by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in monocytic cells involves cooperation between interferon regulatory factor-1 , NF kappa B , and Sp1 transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We investigated the molecular basis of the synergistic induction by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) of human interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) gene in THP-1 monocytic cells , and compared it with the basis of this induction by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Functional studies with IL-6 promoter demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha action , whereas <scope type="spec" id="0"> only one of these regions <cue type="spec" id="0">seemed</cue> to be implicated in LPS activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The three regions concerned are : 1 ) a region between -73 and -36 , which is the minimal element inducible by LPS or TNF-alpha ; 2 ) an element located between -181 and -73 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> which <cue type="spec" id="1">appeared</cue> to regulate the response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha negatively</scope> ; and 3 ) a distal element upstream of -224 , which was inducible by IFN-gamma alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">LPS signaling was found to involve NF kappa B activation by the p50/p65 heterodimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha , in monocytic cells , involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NF kappa B p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Sp1 factor , whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-gamma .</sentence>
