<sentence id="0">Activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor in a T-lymphocytic cell line by hypochlorous acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) such as hydrogen peroxide serve as second messengers in the induction of the transcription factor NF-kappaB , and hence in the activation and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) in human cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">During inflammatory reactions , many oxidative species are produced , one of which is hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) , which is responsible for the microbicidal effects of activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Treatment of a T-lymphocytic cell line with micromolar concentrations of HOCl promoted the appearance of transcription factor NF-kappaB ( the heterodimer p50/p65 ) in the nucleus of the cells , even in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of de novo protein synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Western blot analysis of the NF-kappaB inhibitory subunits ( IkappaB ) demonstrated that both IkappaB-alpha proteolysis and p105 processing were induced by the treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NF-kappaB activation was very effective when cells were subjected to hyperthermia before being treated with HOCl .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Various antioxidants , such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , p-bromophenacyl-bromide and nordihydroguaiaretic acid could strongly reduce NF-kappaB translocation , demonstrating the importance of oxidative species in the transduction mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , ACH-2 cells treated with HOCl or H2O2 released tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) in the supernatants .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The importance of TNF-alpha release in NF-kappaB induction by HOCl or H2O2 was demonstrated by the fact that : ( 1 ) the nuclear appearance of NF-kappaB was promoted in untreated cells ; and ( 2 ) synergism between TNF-alpha and HOCl was detected .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Collectively , these results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that HOCl <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">should</cue> be considered as an oxidative species capable of inducing NF-kappaB in a T-lymphocytic cell line through a transduction mechanism involving ROS , and having a long-distance effect through subsequent TNF-alpha release</scope></scope> .</sentence>
