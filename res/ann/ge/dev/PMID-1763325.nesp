<sentence id="1">Dimerization among transcription factors has become a recurrent theme in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha ( HNF-1 alpha ) is a homeodomain-containing protein that functions as a dimer .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 alpha ( DCoH ) was identified that displayed a restricted tissue distribution and did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> bind to DNA</scope> , but , rather , selectively stabilized HNF-1 alpha dimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The formation of a stable tetrameric DCoH-HNF-1 alpha complex , which required the dimerization domain of HNF-1 alpha , did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> change the DNA binding characteristics of HNF-1 alpha</scope> , but enhanced its transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , DCoH did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> confer transcriptional activation to the GAL4 DNA binding domain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> DCoH regulates formation of transcriptionally active tetrameric complexes and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> contribute to the developmental specificity of the complex</scope></scope> .</sentence>
