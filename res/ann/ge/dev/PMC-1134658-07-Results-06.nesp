<sentence id="0">BMP-6 production in B cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The fact that BMP-6 has been reported to act as an autocrine stimulator in chondrocytes [ 18 ] and ovarium [ 19 ] , prompted us to investigate <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> normal human B cells <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> produce BMP-6 upon stimulation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Ramos cells , which have been described to express BMP-6 mRNA endogenously [ 20 ] , and the T cell line Jurkat , served as positive and negative controls , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Endogenous BMP-6 mRNA levels in normal B cells were quantified by real-time RT-PCR after stimulation with anti-IgM for different time points .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , the up-regulation of BMP-6 mRNA was characteristic of an early-to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti-IgM .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The level of BMP-6 mRNA was back to baseline after 24 hours upon stimulation ( Figure 10 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , both FCS and human AB-serum induced significant upregulation of BMP-6 mRNA ( Figure 11 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , in a separate study we have found that normal human T cells do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> express BMP-6 mRNA after activation</scope> ( Sivertsen et al , manuscript in preparation ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Next , we wanted to detect BMP-6 protein in normal B-cells and tested various commercially available antibodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , in our hands these anti-BMP-6 antibodies did only recognize the recombinant BMP-6 protein and <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> the native protein</scope> .</sentence>
