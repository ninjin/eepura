<sentence id="0">Nasal NK- and T-cell lymphomas share the same type of Epstein-Barr virus latency as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin 's disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nasal T/NK-cell lymphomas can be further separated into those of natural killer ( NK ) cell lineage or of T-cell lineage , with differences in cellular phenotype , T-cell receptor ( TcR ) gene rearrangement and TcR transcript expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Both NK- and T-cell subtypes are closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , EBV gene expression was determined in 23 cases of nasal lymphoma ( NL ) by in situ hybridisation ( ISH ) , reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and immunohistochemistry ( IH ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Of the 23 cases , 19 were classified as NK-cell and 4 as T-cell tumours .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">ISH for EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated RNAs showed that all cases , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> NK or T</scope> , harboured EBV in virtually all tumour cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RT-PCR demonstrated that NL of both subtypes expressed EBNAI of the QUK splice pattern , the latent membrane proteins , LMP1 and 2 and the BamHI A rightward transcripts in the absence of EBNA2 mRNAs , compatible with the latency type II pattern .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , analysis of EBV protein expression by IH revealed a heterogeneous pattern of EBV gene expression at the single-cell level consisting of both LMP1+ and LMP1- tumour cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a mixture of latency I and II</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although 2 early lytic transcripts , BZLF1 and BHRF1 , were also detected in 13 and 10 cases , respectively , the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> of ZEBRA staining</scope> in any case <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicates that</cue> these lytic transcripts are most <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">likely</cue> expressed by rare cells in the biopsies entering lytic cycle</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The viral transcriptional pattern similar to that of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin 's disease <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that EBV <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">can</cue> exploit common regulatory mechanisms for gene transcription in diverse host cell types</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Down-regulation of immunogenic proteins ( EBNA2-EBNA6 ) in nasal lymphoma <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> enable tumour cells to evade host cytotoxic T-cell surveillance</scope> .</sentence>
