<sentence id="0">NF-kappaB only partially mediates Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 activation of B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is required for EBV-induced immortalization of human B cells and causes tumorigenic transformation of cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">LMP1 expression induces phenotypic changes resembling B cell activation , such as cell size increase and up-regulation of cell surface activation markers .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">LMP1 contains two domains that activate the transcription factor NF-kappaB , one through interactions with TRAF proteins and the other with the TRADD protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The purpose of the present study was to investigate the importance of NF-kappaB induction in the up-regulation of the B cell activation markers ICAM-1 and CD71 by LMP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This study shows that expression of LMP1 activates transcription from p50/p65- and c-Rel- responsive promoters , and that this activity can be completely inhibited by expression of a dominant inhibitory IkappaB mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">ICAM-1 and CD71 are nevertheless up-regulated by LMP1 in primary B cells and cell lines expressing the dominant IkappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , LMP1-induced cell size increase of primary B cells was unaffected by IkappaB expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It was concluded that even when LMP1 is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to activate NF-kappaB</scope> , it is still capable of inducing certain characteristics of activated B cells , strongly <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that LMP1 can also activate cells independently of NF-kappaB</scope> .</sentence>
