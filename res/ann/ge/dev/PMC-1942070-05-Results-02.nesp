<sentence id="0">Cellular proliferation and survival in DT40 B cells <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> expression of PKD family</scope> kinases</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PKD enzymes have previously been linked to the regulation of cell proliferation and survival ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the effect that loss of PKD kinases had on B cell survival and/or proliferation we cultured wild-type and PKD-null cells in the presence ( PKD1/3==-==/==- = = : Flag-PKD3+ve ) or absence ( PKD1/3==-==/==- = = ) of doxycycline and monitored exponential growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As shown in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">2A , PKD1/3==-==/==- = = cells proliferated exponentially and re-expression of Flag-PKD3 in these cells had <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> impact on the rate of proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , the viability of PKD1/3==-==/==- = = B cells during routine culturing was not significantly different from that of wild-type B cells <scope type="neg" id="2">( data <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It was noted that the population doubling time of PKD1/3==-==/==- = = cells was slightly slower than that of wild type DT40 cells ( 12.7======+/-======2.8====h versus 10.2======+/-======0.4====h ) but the failure of PKD3 re-expression to modify the proliferation rate of PKD1/3==-==/==- = = cells <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> that these small differences were most <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">likely</cue> the result of clonal variation</scope> and were <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> caused specifically by loss of PKD enzymes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , PKD family enzymes are <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> essential for regulating basal survival and proliferation of DT40 B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">PKD enzymes , specifically PKD1 and PKD2 , have previously been linked to a protective role against oxidative stress-induced injury in 3T3 fibroblast , HeLa and epithelial cell lines [ 17,30==-==32 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We therefore addressed the role of PKD family kinases in regulating B cell survival in response to oxidative stress and other stress stimuli .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">As shown in Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">2B , loss of PKD1/3 expression had <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">no</cue> significant impact on the survival of DT40 B cells in response to mitochondrial stress stimuli ( H2O2 or serum deprivation ) ; DNA damaging agents ( etoposide or doxorubicin ) ; ER pathway stress due to calcium overload ( thapsigargin ) or following prolonged treatment with phorbol esters or Trichostatin A , an inhibitor of class I/II HDACs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Thus , PKD kinases do <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> play an essential role in regulating B cell survival in response to a range of different stress stimuli</scope> .</sentence>
