<sentence id="0">Antisense oligonucleotides to the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B block CD11b expression and alter adhesion properties of differentiated HL-60 granulocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappa B is a pleiotropic regulator of a variety of genes implicated in the cellular response to injury .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This function has been attributed to the coordinated binding of subunits of NF-kappa B to distinct regions of the promoter elements of numerous genes , including cytokines , growth factor receptors , and adhesion molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kappa B complex were used to define the physiologic role of this transcription factor in resting and stimulated granulocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A reduction in the expression of p65 was produced by treatment with the phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This reduction was accompanied by rapid changes in the cellular adhesion of dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 leukemia cells stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These effects were characterized by a marked reduction in CD11b integrin expression on the surface of treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , the p65 antisense oligomer effectively abolished an upregulation of CD11b that was produced by formyl-met-leu-phe and TPA .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , the p65 antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> significant effect on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates or on phagocytosis by these cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> antisense oligomers to p65 <cue type="spec" id="2">can</cue> be used to define the role of NF-kappa B in the activation pathways of neutrophils</scope></scope> .</sentence>
