<sentence id="0">Molecular and cellular analysis of human immunodeficiency virus-induced apoptosis in lymphoblastoid T-cell-line-expressing wild-type and mutated CD4 receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously shown that the presence of the CD4 cytoplasmic tail is critical for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced apoptosis ( J.Corbeil , M.Tremblay , and D.D.Richman , J.Exp.Med.183:39-48 , 1996 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have pursued our investigation of the role of the CD4 transduction pathway in HIV-induced apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To do this , wild-type and mutant forms of the CD4 cytoplasmic tail were stably expressed in the lymphoblastoid T-cell line A2.01 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Apoptosis was prevented when CD4 truncated at residue 402 was expressed ; however , cells expressing mutated receptors that do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> associate with p56(lck) ( mutated at the dicysteine motif and truncated at residue 418 )</scope> but which conserved proximal domains of the cytoplasmic tail underwent apoptosis like wild- type CD4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The differences between wild-type and mutated receptors in the induction of apoptosis were <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> related to levels of p56(lck) or NF- kappaB activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Initial signaling through the CD4 receptor played a major role in the sensitization of HIV-infected T cells to undergo apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Incubation of HIV-infected cells with monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) 13B8-2 , which binds to CD4 in a region critical for dimerization of the receptor , prevented apoptosis <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> inhibiting HIV replication</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , the apoptotic process was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> related to Fas-Fas ligand interaction</scope> ; however , an antagonistic anti-Fas MAb ( ZB-4 ) enhanced apoptosis in HIV-infected cells <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> inducing apoptosis in uninfected cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These observations demonstrate that CD4 signaling mediates HIV-induced apoptosis by a mechanism independent of Fas-Fas ligand interaction , does <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> require p56(lck) signaling</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> involve a critical region for CD4 dimerization</scope> .</sentence>
