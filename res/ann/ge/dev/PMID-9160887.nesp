<sentence id="0">Characterization of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes transduced with HTLV-I Tax mutants with different trans-activating phenotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tax1 , a transcriptional trans-activator of the Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , induces the expression of many cellular genes through interaction with at least three distinct cellular transcription factors ; CREB/ATF , NF-kappaB , and SRF .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This Tax1-induced activation of cellular genes is considered to be a critical event in T-cell transformation by HTLV-I .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To elucidate the role of each Tax1-inducible transcriptional pathway in T-cell transformation , we introduced Tax1 mutants with different trans-activating phenotypes into peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) by retroviral vectors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis of these PBLs revealed that activation of the NF-kappaB pathway is sufficient to promote the growth response to IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , for the clonal expansion of CD4+ T-cells , which is a characteristic result of HTLV-I infection , activation of the CREB/ATF and SRF pathways is also required .</sentence>
