<sentence id="0">Active suppression of the class II transactivator-encoding AIR-1 locus is responsible for the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression</scope> observed during differentiation from B cells to plasma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this study the genetic control of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II gene expression during the transition from B cell to plasma cell has been analyzed .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Class II molecules are <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> expressed in plasma cells</scope> because of an active suppression resulting in the abrogation of class II gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show here that the plasma cell-specific repressor function , designated SIR ( suppressor of immune response genes ) , does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> act directly on the transcription of class II genes</scope> , but instead on the transcription of the AIR-1 gene , whose product , the class II transactivator ( CIITA ) , is fundamental for the regulation of the constitutive and inducible expression of MHC class II genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This was unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that plasmacytoma x B cell hybrids carrying an AIR-1 locus derived from CIITA-expressing cells do <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> express CIITA-specific transcripts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transfection of a cDNA containing the human CIITA coding sequence under the control of an heterologous promoter restores expression of human MHC class II genes in the hybrids and is responsible for de novo expression of mouse MHC class II genes in both the mouse plasmacytoma cell line and the hybrids .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results confirm and extend the notion of the functional conservation of the AIR-1 gene product across species barriers .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , in CIITA-transfected cell hybrids , <scope type="neg" id="4">cell surface expression of the human HLA-DQ heterodimer was <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> observed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This result was <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> attributable to <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">lack</cue> of HLA-DQ alpha or -DQ beta transcription</scope></scope> , because both transcripts were present in the CIITA-transfected hybrids , although at reduced levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings further support our previous observations on the distinct regulation of expression of the human HLA-DQ class II subset , which <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be thus controlled at the posttranscriptional level by a CIITA-independent mechanism</scope> .</sentence>
