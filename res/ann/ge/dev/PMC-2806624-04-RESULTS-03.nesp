<sentence id="0">Regulation of FOXP3 promoter activity and FOXP3 protein expression by RUNX1 and RUNX3</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To investigate the effect of RUNX1 and RUNX3 binding to the RUNX binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter , we transfected human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells with a FOXP3 promoter luciferase reporter vector and RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">An increase in luciferase activity was observed only when the FOXP3 promoter ( = = -==511 to +176 ) luciferase construct was cotransfected with RUNX1 or RUNX3 expression vectors ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">4 A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The increase in promoter activity was greater upon cotransfection of RUNX3 compared with RUNX1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Luciferase expression was abrogated when the Runx binding sites in the FOXP3 promoter ( = = -==511 to +176 ) luciferase construct were mutated ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">4 A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In these experiments , the overexpression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 eliminated the need of TGF-==beta = = for FOXP3 promoter activation and PMA/ionomycin stimulation was sufficient .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">To examine the role of each of the three RUNX binding sites for the FOXP3 promoter activity , we mutated each individually or in combination .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">No</cue> reduction in luciferase activity was observed when the = = -==53 site was mutated and only a slight reduction when either the = = -==287 or = = -==333 site was mutated</scope> ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">4 B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , mutating the = = -==53 site in combination with one of the other two sites led to a significant decrease in luciferase activity , with the greatest reduction observed when all three binding sites were mutated ( Fig .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">4 B ) , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that the identified binding sites have redundant functions and RUNX binding to more than one site</scope> is necessary for the full activation of the FOXP3 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Supporting these findings , the overexpression of RUNX1 in human primary CD4+ T cells resulted in significantly elevated levels of FOXP3 protein measured by flow cytometry after 48 h. This was achieved <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> any requirement for anti-CD3 , anti-CD28 stimulation , or the presence of TGF-==beta = =</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Although there was a trend , the transfection of CD4+ T cells with RUNX3 did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> lead to statistically significant increase in FOXP3 ( Fig</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">S5 ) .</sentence>
