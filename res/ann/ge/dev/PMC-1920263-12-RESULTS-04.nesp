<sentence id="0">A GC-box located at position = = -==87/==-==78 of the A3G promoter is important for transcriptional activity</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The reporter studies shown in Figure 3 had demonstrated a drop in luciferase activity after deletion of the 30 nt at the 5 = = ' = = end of the 180 bp core promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We therefore inspected the 30 bp sequence deleted in the 150 bp fragment and identified a GC-box at position = = -==87/==-==78 ( see Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The sequence TGGGCGGGAC , which is interrupted in the 150 bp fragment , represents a variant of the (G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(C/T ) consensus motif recognized by Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To analyze <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> this <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> Sp1/Sp3-binding site mediates transcriptional activity of the 180 bp core promoter</scope></scope> , we introduced two point mutations which changed the sequence from TGGGCGGGAC to TGTTCGGGAC ( mutations shown in bold ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This resulted in a 71 % reduction of the transcriptional activity compared to the unmodified 180 bp promoter ( Figure 5A ) and this value was only marginally higher than the luciferase activity of the 150 bp fragment , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> the identified motif is essential for basal activity of the A3G core promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To further examine the transcriptional potency of the 30 nt present in the 180 bp promoter , we cloned the region = = -==114/==-==85 ( containing all nucleotides which are deleted in the 150 bp fragment , designated E1 ) or the region = = -==92/==-==63 ( containing the putative Sp1/Sp3 motif , designated E2 ) into the vector pGL3-Promoter ( see Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This vector contains a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an SV40 promoter without enhancer sequences , and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">putative</cue> transcriptionally active</scope> sequences can be cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Luciferase assays showed that the E1 element increased SV40 promoter activity only by = = approximately==2-fold ( Figure 5B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In contrast , the 30 nt of E2 enhanced the transcriptional activity of the SV40 promoter by = = approximately==4.3-fold , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> the intact GC-box present in the E2 element was responsible for the strongly enhanced transcriptional activity of the SV40 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
