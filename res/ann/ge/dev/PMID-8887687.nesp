<sentence id="0">Calcium-dependent immediate-early gene induction in lymphocytes is negatively regulated by p21Ha-ras .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The induction of immediate-early ( IE ) response genes , such as egr-1 , c-fos , and c-jun , occurs rapidly after the activation of T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The process of activation involves calcium mobilization , activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , and phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">p21(ras) , a guanine nucleotide binding factor , mediates T-cell signal transduction through PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The involvement of p21(ras) in the regulation of calcium-dependent signals has been <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> through analysis of its role in the activation of NF-AT</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have investigated the inductions of the IE genes in response to calcium signals in Jurkat cells ( in the presence of activated p21(ras) ) and their correlated consequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The expression of activated p21(ras) negatively regulated the induction of IE genes by calcium ionophore .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This inhibition of calcium-activated IE gene induction was reversed by treatment with cyclosporin A , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> the involvement of calcineurin in this regulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A later result of inhibition of this activation pathway by p21(ras) was down-regulation of the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 and subsequent coordinate reductions in IL-2 gene expression and protein production .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that p2l(ras) is an essential mediator in generating not only positive but also negative modulatory mechanisms controlling the competence of T cells in response to inductive stimulations</scope> .</sentence>
