<sentence id="0">GM-CSF and IL-2 share common control mechanisms in response to costimulatory signals in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Antigen complexed with major histocompatibility complex class I or II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells interacts with the T cell receptor ( TCR ) on the surface of T cells and initiates an activation cascade .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">So called costimulatory signals , mediated by other cell surface interactions or soluble cytokines produced by antigen presenting cells , are also required for complete T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">High levels of cytokine gene expression in T cells also required both TCR and costimulatory signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor requires sequences in the promoter as well as a powerful enhancer located 3kb upstream to respond to TCR-like signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These promoter and enhancer regions are mainly activated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The activation of NFAT by TCR signals has been well described for interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-4 gene transcription in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Costimulatory signals , such as activation of the CD28 cell surface molecule on T cells , lead to activation through a distinct region of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This region is termed the CK-1 or CD28RE and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to bind specific members of the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Human T leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infects T cells and can lead to increase GM-CSF expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We have found that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein , tax , acts as a costimulatory signal for GM-CSF and IL-2 gene transcription , in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Tax activates the GM-CSF promoter through the CK-1/CD28RE region and also activates nuclear factor-kappa B binding to this region .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">However , other transcription factors or coactivators of NF-kappa B are required for tax activation but these remain to be identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The CK-1/CD28RE of GM-CSF shows a high degree of similarity to the IL-2 CD28RE and the IL-3 gene also contains a related region .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">This observation , together with the fact that both GM-CSF and IL-2 respond to TCR signals via NFAT , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">implies</cue> a high degree of conservation in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in T cells</scope> .</sentence>
