<sentence id="0">Human interferon regulatory factor 2 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Intron-exon organization and functional analysis of 5'-flanking region .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Interferon regulatory factor 2 ( IRF-2 ) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that terminates interferon beta expression initiated by interferon regulatory factor 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we isolated the genomic DNA for human IRF-2 gene , determined the intron-exon structure of the human IRF-2 gene , mapped the major transcription initiation site , identified a number of potential regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking region , and localized the IRF-2 gene on human chromosome 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The IRF-2 promoter region contains a CpG island , with several GC boxes , a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> NF-kappa B-binding site</scope> , and a CAAT box , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> TATA box</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When the promoter region was linked with a heterologous reporter gene , we found that the promoter region is inducible by both interferons ( interferon-alpha and -gamma ) and interferon regulatory factor 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The region which induced these inductions was identified as being confined to 40 nucleotides 5' to the major transcriptional initiation site by testing a series of clones with truncated promoter of IRF-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This region contains elements which are shared with the transcriptional enhancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor 1 , interferon beta , and interferon-inducible genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway , but also <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF-2</scope></scope> .</sentence>
