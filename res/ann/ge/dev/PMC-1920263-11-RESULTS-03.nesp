<sentence id="0">The A3G promoter is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> inducible in T cells</scope></sentence>
<sentence id="1">According to the current knowledge , APOBEC3G plays a role in the innate defence against pathogens like HIV-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The latter has evolved a mechanism to counteract A3G activity by expressing the regulatory protein Vif ( 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Vif induces proteasomal degradation of A3G and additionally inhibits A3G activity by further mechanisms ( 8 , 37==-==43 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the overexpression of HIV-1 proteins also influences A3G promoter activity</scope> , we either expressed HIV-1 Vif or the HIV-1 Tat protein , the latter has been shown to activate different viral and cellular promoters ( 44,45 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , increasing amounts of the plasmid pNL4-3 , containing the full-length genome of HIV-1 , were transfected .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These constructs or the empty vector pcDNA3.1 were cotransfected with the 1025 bp construct into A3.01 T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Luciferase assays showed that the transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter was not significantly altered in the presence of Vif , Tat or HIV-1NL4-3 ( Figure 4A ) , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="2">HIV-1 is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> modulating A3G expression on the transcriptional level</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It has been shown that the amount of A3G mRNA in T cells is increased in response to mitogenic stimulation with phorbol ester ( 46==-==48 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , interferons have been described to upregulate A3G expression in hepatocytes and macrophages ( 46,48 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">whether</cue> these stimuli interfere with A3G promoter activity in T cells</scope> , we transfected A3.01 T cells with the 1025 bp promoter or the empty vector pGL3-Basic ( vector ) and treated the cells with phorbol ester ( TPA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The luciferase assay showed that <scope type="neg" id="5">the = = approximately==15-fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025 bp promoter relative to the empty vector was <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> further enhanced by TPA treatment</scope> ( Figure 4B ) , although the functional activity of TPA was confirmed by induction of the SV40 promoter-containing reporter plasmid pGL3-Control <scope type="neg" id="6">( data <cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Similarly , treatment of A3.01 T cells transfected with the A3G promoter deletion constructs with IFN-==alpha = = or IFN-==gamma = = showed <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">no</cue> effect ( Figure 4C</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Interestingly , a control plasmid ( pGL2-CVX ) containing twoIFN-responsive GAS ( gamma activated sequence ) elements upstream of the luciferase reporter gene was only induced by IFN-==alpha = = in these cells ( Figure 4C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Since two reports describe A3G upregulation by interferons in hepatocytes ( 47,48 ) , we additionally performed the experiment in the hepatic cell line HepG2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">In line with these publications , we observed an induction of the A3G promoter by approximately 2-fold after IFN-==alpha = = or IFN-==gamma = = stimulation ( Figure 4D ) with IFN-==gamma = = being slightly more potent .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">For both interferon types , induction of A3G promoter activity was observed for all deletion constructs except for the 60 bp fragment , <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">indicating that</cue> the responsible region is located within the 60 nt present in the 120 bp , but <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> in the 60 bp fragment</scope></scope> .</sentence>
