<sentence id="0">Abnormal NF-kappa B activity in T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with decreased p65-RelA protein expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Numerous cellular and biochemical abnormalities in immune regulation have been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , including surface Ag receptor-initiated signaling events and lymphokine production .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because NF-kappa B contributes to the transcription of numerous inflammatory genes and has been shown to be a molecular target of antiinflammatory drugs , we sought to characterize the functional role of the NF-kappa B protein complex in lupus T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Freshly isolated T cells from lupus patients , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients , and normal individuals were activated physiologically via the TCR with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs to assess proximal membrane signaling , and with PMA and a calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) to bypass membrane-mediated signaling events .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We measured the NF-kappa B binding activity in nuclear extracts by gel shift analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When compared with normal cells , the activation of NF-kappa B activity in SLE patients was significantly decreased in SLE , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in RA</scope> , patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="1">NF-kappa B binding activity was <cue type="neg" id="1">absent</cue> in several SLE patients who were <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> receiving any medication , including corticosteroids</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Also , <scope type="neg" id="3">NF-kappa B activity remained <cue type="neg" id="3">absent</cue> in follow-up studies</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In supershift experiments using specific Abs , we showed that , in the group of SLE patients who displayed undetectable NF-kappa B activity , <scope type="neg" id="4">p65 complexes were <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> formed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Finally , immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts showed decreased or <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">absent</cue> p65 protein levels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">As p65 complexes are transcriptionally active in comparison to the p50 homodimer , this novel finding <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> provide insight on the origin of abnormal <scope type="spec" id="7"> cytokine <cue type="spec" id="7">or</cue> other gene transcription</scope> in SLE patients</scope> .</sentence>
