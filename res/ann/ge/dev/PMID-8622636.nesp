<sentence id="2">We report the effect of E3330 on transcriptional activation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha gene and on nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Nuclear run-on experiments showed that E3330 decreases transcriptional activation of TNF-alpha gene induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation in human peripheral monocytes .</sentence>
