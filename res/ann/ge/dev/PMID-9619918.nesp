<sentence id="0">IL-2-induced growth of CD8+ T cell prolymphocytic leukemia cells mediated by NF-kappaB induction and IL-2 receptor alpha expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The binding of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) to its receptor on normal T cells induces nuclear expression of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , activation of the IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) alpha chain gene , and cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , the role of IL-2R signaling in the growth of CD8+ T cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T-PLL ) cells has been investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Flow cytometry revealed that primary leukemia cells from a patient with CD8+ T-PLL expressed IL-2Ralpha and beta chains , and the cells showed a proliferative response and an increase in IL-2Ralpha expression on culture with exogeneous IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Northern blot analysis <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to detect IL-2 mRNA</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that IL-2 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> act in a paracrine manner in vivo</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays revealed that recombinant IL-2 increased NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts of the leukemia cells , and Northern blot analysis showed that IL-2 increased the abundance of mRNAs encoding the NF-kappaB components c-Rel and KBF1 in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">IL-2 binding analysis demonstrated that IL-2 markedly increased the number of low affinity IL-2Rs on the leukemia cells , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> an effect on the number of high-affinity IL-2Rs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results show that IL-2 is capable of inducing the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB in primary CD8+ T-PLL cells , and that this effect is mediated , at least in part , at a pretranslational level .</sentence>
