<sentence id="0">Apoptosis-resistant T cells have a deficiency in NF-kappaB-mediated induction of Fas ligand transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Apoptosis induced through the TCR in CD4+ T cells is mostly mediated by the inducible expression of Fas ligand ( FasL ) as a primary event leading to the commitment to death .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To gain a better understanding of the transcriptional events that regulate this expression , we took advantage of our previously described mutant Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These cells are deficient in FasL expression and apoptosis induced upon TCR triggering , although their cytokine ( IL-2 and IFN-gamma ) production is normal .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that both a FasL- and a consensus NF-kappaB- reporter construct are inefficiently induced in these cells compared to wild-type cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , we demonstrate that the inducible transcriptional activity of the FasL reporter is abolished by specific inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , we could trace the deficit of the mutant cells to an inefficient NF-kappaB activation , evidencing a relevant role for NF-kappaB in the regulation of FasL expression in activated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the induction of FasL versus cytokine gene expression is differentially sensitive to NF-kappaB deprivation</scope> .</sentence>
