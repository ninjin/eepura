<sentence id="0">Inhibition of p105 processing by NF-kappaB proteins in transiently transfected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein , which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The processing of p105 occurs constitutively in vivo but can be markedly enhanced by various cellular activation agents , although <scope type="spec" id="0"> the underlying regulatory mechanism is <cue type="spec" id="0">not</cue> yet clear</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study , we demonstrate that signal-mediated induction of p105 processing in human T cells is associated with de novo synthesis of this precursor protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transient transfection studies performed in COS7 cells revealed that <scope type="spec" id="1"> the newly synthesized p105 protein <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to be more rapidly processed compared to its accumulated form that is already associated with the processed product p50</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , the processing rate of p105 is markedly inhibited in cells co-transfected with p50 or other NF-kappaB subunits , including RelA and c-Rel , that physically interact with p105 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the processing of p105 is subject to negative regulation by the various NF-kappaB subunits</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We further demonstrate that p105 undergoes degradation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , the inducible degradation of p105 is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> coupled with the generation of p50</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Together , these studies demonstrate that the processing and inducible degradation of p105 are differentially regulated .</sentence>
