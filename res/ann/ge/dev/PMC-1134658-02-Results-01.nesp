<sentence id="0">BMP-6 inhibits anti-IgM induced proliferation of human B cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The effects of BMP-6 on normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells prompted us to investigate the effects of BMP-6 on normal human B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">All experiments in this study were performed under serum-free conditions as FCS has been shown to interfere with BMP-signalling [ 14 ] ( own observations ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To study the effect of BMP-6 on proliferation , B-cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated with anti-IgM and/or CD40L in the presence or absence of BMP-6 for three days .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that BMP-6 led to a 35 % mean reduction of anti-IgM- induced DNA synthesis ( n = 8 ; p = = < / = = = 0.0002 , Figure 1A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Similar results were obtained for B cells treated with anti-IgM and CD40L ( 26 % mean reduction , n = 6 ; p = = < / = = = 0.023 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The BMP-6-induced inhibition of proliferation was dose-dependent in both peripheral B cells ( Figure 1B ) and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos ( 40 % reduction of DNA synthesis , Figure 1C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The BMP-6 effects could be reversed by addition of the extracellular inhibitor Noggin ( Figure 1D ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Similarly , a combination of the soluble BMP receptors BMP-RIB-Fc and BMP-RII-Fc also neutralized the effects of BMP-6 <scope type="neg" id="0">( data <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Next , we wanted to test <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> BMP-6 had different effect on na==i==ve and memory B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Na==i==ve ( CD19+CD27- ) and memory ( CD19+CD27+ ) B cells were isolated from peripheral blood by cell sorting of immunobead-isolated CD19+ B cells [ 15 ] , and tested for their capacity to proliferate in the presence of BMP-6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , BMP-6 inhibited anti-IgM induced DNA synthesis in the two subpopulations to a similar extent , with a mean reduction of DNA-synthesis of 45 % ( n = 5 ; p = = < / = = = 0,004 ) for na==i==ve B cells and 48 % ( n = 5 ; p = = < / = = = 0,001 ) for memory B cells ( Figure 1E ) .</sentence>
