<sentence id="0">Costimulation requirement for AP-1 and NF-kappa B transcription factor activation in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter requires T-cell costimulation delivered by the TCR and the auxiliary receptor CD28 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several transcription factors participate in IL-2 promoter activation , among which are AP-1-like factors and NF-kappa B. Protein phosphorylation has an important role in the regulation of these two factors : ( 1 ) it induces the transactivating capacity of the AP-1 protein c-Jun ; and ( 2 ) it is involved in the release of the cytoplasmic inhibitor , I kappa B , from NF-kappa B , allowing translocation of the latter into the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have recently shown that both phosphorylation processes require T-cell costimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , in activated T cells , the kinetics of the two phosphorylation events are essentially similar .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">According to our results , however , the kinases responsible for the two processes are distinct entities .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Whereas TPCK inhibits phosphorylation of I kappa B and , consequently , activation of NF-kappa B , it markedly enhances the activity of JNK , the MAP kinase-related kinase that phosphorylates the transactivation domain of c-Jun .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We , therefore , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> the activation scheme presented in FIGURE 3 for T-cell costimulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Costimulation results in the activation of a signaling pathway that leads to the simultaneous induction of the two transcription factors , AP-1 and NF-kappa B. Integration of the signals generated by TCR and CD28 engagement occurs along this pathway , which then bifurcates to induce I kappa B phosphorylation and NF-kappa B activation on the one hand , and JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation on the other .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We are currently engaged in defining where the two signals integrate along the AP-1/NF-kappa B pathway .</sentence>
