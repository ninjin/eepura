<sentence id="0">Identification and characterization of a leukocyte-specific component of the nuclear body .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The nuclear body ( NB ) is a cellular organelle that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The NB is also a target of antibodies in the serum of patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis was used to identify a cDNA encoding a novel component of the NB , a 140-kDa protein designated Sp140 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The predicted amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal portion of Sp140 was similar to Sp100 , a previously identified NB protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The carboxyl portion of Sp140 contained a zinc-finger domain and a bromodomain , motifs that are present in proteins regulating gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">High levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> other human tissues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The level of SP140 mRNA in myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4 markedly increased in response to chemically induced cellular differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate that SP140 localized to the NB in differentiated HL60 and NB4 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The location of Sp140 in the NB , and expression of this gene in cells involved in host defense , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that Sp140 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection</scope></scope> .</sentence>
