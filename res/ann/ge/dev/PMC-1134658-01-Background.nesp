<sentence id="0">Background</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Members of the transforming growth factor = = beta = = ( TGF-==beta = = ) superfamily play central roles in controlling cellular proliferation , differentiation , migration and apoptosis [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These cytokines can be divided into three subgroups : TGF-==beta = = , the activins/inhibins , and the bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) , of which the latter constitute the largest family .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">BMPs are 30==-==38 kDa hetero- or homodimeric proteins originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation [ 2,3 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Several studies have demonstrated an essential role of these proteins during embryogenesis , and more recently , also in adult tissues [ 1 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">TGF-==beta = = has been intensively studied in normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and is one of the most potent endogenous negative regulators known to date .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">[ 4 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="0">the effect of BMPs in the immune system has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been widely investigated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In that respect , BMP- 2 , -4 and -7 have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [ 5 ] and early T cell development [ 6,7 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">BMP-6 has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone-area-forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells [ 8 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , BMP-2 , -4 , 6 and -7 had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells [ 9-11 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In addition , by gene expression profiling , BMP-6 significantly increased the predictive value for a multi-gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphomas ( DLBCL ) [ 12 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">BMP-6 , like the other BMP members , signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of BMP type I [ activin-like-kinase ( ALK ) ] and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors , which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating Smad proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA , BMP-RIA , and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII , Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB , which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads ( Smad-1 , Smad-5 , and Smad-8 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The R- Smads then form complexes with the co-Smad ( Smad4 ) and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation [ 1,13 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Given the reported role of BMP-6 in B-cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells , we wanted to explore its <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> role in normal human B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">We studied the effects of BMP-6 on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Furthermore , the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1==-==Id4 , were resolved .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Finally , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> B cells also were capable of producing BMP-6</scope> .</sentence>
