<sentence id="0">Extinction of immunoglobulin gene expression in B cells upon fusion with HeLa cells is preceded by rapid nuclear depletion of essential transcription factors and is accompanied by widespread inactivation of genes expressed in a B cell-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">When immunoglobulin ( Ig ) expressing B cells are fused with non-B cells , Ig expression is rapidly suppressed at the level of transcription , a phenomenon termed extinction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we demonstrate that fusion of HeLa cells with either diploid or tetraploid B cells ( Daudi ) results in widespread extinction of several other B cell-encoded genes that are expressed in a B cell-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast , expression of B cell-expressed genes that are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> dependent on cell-specific controls</scope> is unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that the molecular mechanism(s) underlying Ig gene extinction can be explained , at least in part , by a <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of transcription factors that are essential for Ig gene transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These transcription factors are <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">either</cue> <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> produced due to block of transcription of their respective genes ( Oct-2 , OBF-1 , PU.1 )</scope> , or are rendered inactive posttranslationally ( NF-kappa B , E47 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By isolating Daudi x HeLa heterokaryons a few hours after fusion , we have studied the initial fate of two B cell-specific transcription factors involved in Ig gene transcription , Oct-2 and NF-kappa B. This report provides the first demonstration that upon fusion with HeLa cells , the nuclear contents of B cell-expressed transcription factors are depleted within a few hours with kinetics that are as fast or faster than that of Ig gene extinction .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , the extinguishing mechanism is effective very early after fusion .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that extinction of Ig genes is part of a global mechanism that suppresses the differentiation program foreign to the HeLa phenotype</scope> .</sentence>
