<sentence id="0">p21ras initiates Rac-1 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/PKB</scope> , mediated signaling pathways in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">p21ras is activated by the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) and then co-ordinates important signaling pathways for T lymphocyte activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Effector pathways for this guanine nucleotide binding protein in T cells are mediated by the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 and the Ras-related GTPase Rac-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In fibroblasts , an important effector for the Ras oncogene is Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PtdIns 3-kinase ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Activation of this lipid kinase is able to induce critical Rac-1 signaling pathways and can couple p21ras to cell survival mechanisms via the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="1">The role of PtdIns 3-kinase in Ras signaling in T cells has <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> been explored</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the present study , we examined the ability of PtdIns 3-kinase to initiate the Rac-1 signaling pathways important for T cell activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also examined the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibility</cue> that Akt/PKB is regulated by Ras signaling pathways in T lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The results show that Ras can initiate a Rac-1 mediated pathway that regulates the transcriptional function of AP-1 complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">PtdIns 3-kinase signals cannot mimic p21ras and induce the Rac mediated responses of AP-1 transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Moreover , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">neither</cue> TCR or Ras activation of AP-1 is dependent on PtdIns 3-kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">PKB is activated in response to triggering of the T cell antigen receptor ; PtdIns 3-kinase activity is both required and sufficient for this TCR response .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="4">p21ras signals are <cue type="neg" id="4">unable</cue> to induce Akt/PKB activity in T cell</scope> <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">nor</cue> is Ras function required for Akt/PKB activation in response to the TCR</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The present data thus highlight that PtdIns 3-kinase and Akt/PKB are <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> universal Ras effector molecules</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Ras can initiate Rac-1 regulated signaling pathways in the context of T cell antigen receptor function independently of PtdIns 3-kinase activity .</sentence>
