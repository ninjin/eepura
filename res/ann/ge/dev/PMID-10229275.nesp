<sentence id="0">High molecular weight dextran sulfate increases the activity of NF-kappaB-regulated promoter in monocyte-derived macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It is known that sulfated polysaccharides can mimic the action of common T-cell mitogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the molecular basis of the mitogenic effect of high molecular weight dextran sulfate ( HMDS ) , monocyte-derived macrophages were transfected with recombinant plasmid containing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) promoter , which is regulated by transcription factor NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We observed that HMDS , similar to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , increases the expression of CAT reporter gene <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> increased activity of NF-kappaB</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The activation of NF-kappaB correlated with the increased expression of B7.1 molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It was postulated that this NF-kappaB-regulated promoter <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> play a role in the activation of the accessory cells as well as the rate of replication of HIV-1 in monocyte-derived macrophages</scope> .</sentence>
