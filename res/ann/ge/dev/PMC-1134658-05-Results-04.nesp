<sentence id="0">BMP-6 induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Upon ligand binding , the type II receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type I receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Type I receptors can signal via several pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We examined the effect of BMP-6 on Smad phosphorylation , as the activation of Smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for BMPs [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">B cells were cultured in serum-free media over night and then treated with BMP-6 for various time points .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Total protein lysates were prepared , and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of Smad1/5/8 were determined by western blot analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested ( 15 minutes ) , and remained high for at least 48 hours ( Figure 5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A similar phosphorylation was observed in Ramos cells , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in HL60 cells ( Figure 6 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , we also tested <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> other known downstream signalling pathways of BMP-6 <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> be triggered by BMP-6 in human B cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">However , we did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells <scope type="neg" id="4">( data <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
