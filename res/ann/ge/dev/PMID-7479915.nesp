<sentence id="0">Coexpression of NF-kappa B/Rel and Sp1 transcription factors in human immunodeficiency virus 1-induced , dendritic cell-T-cell syncytia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Productive infection of T cells with human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) typically requires that the T cells be stimulated with antigens or mitogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This requirement has been attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B , which synergizes with the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 to drive the HIV-1 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , we have found that vigorous replication of HIV-1 takes place in nonactivated memory T cells after syncytium formation with dendritic cells ( DCs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These syncytia <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> activated cells</scope> as determined by an <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of staining for Ki-67 cell cycle antigen</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The expression and activity of NF-kappa B and Sp1 were , therefore , analyzed in isolated T cells and DCs from humans and mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have used immunolabeling , Western blot analysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">T cells <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> active NF-kappa B</scope> but express Sp1 as expected .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">DCs express high levels of all known NF-kappa B and Rel proteins , with activity residing primarily within RelB , p50 , and p65 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , DCs <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lack</cue> Sp1</scope> , which <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> explain the <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">failure</cue> of HIV-1 to replicate in purified DCs</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Coexpression of NF-kappa B and Sp1 occurs in the heterologous DC-T-cell syncytia that are induced by HIV-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Therefore , HIV-1-induced cell fusion brings together factors that upregulate virus transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Since DCs and memory T cells frequently traffic together in situ , these unusual heterologous syncytia could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic HIV-1 replication <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">without</cue> ostensible immune stimulation</scope> .</sentence>
