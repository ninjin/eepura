<sentence id="0">Possible differences in the mechanism(s) of action of different glucocorticoid hormone compounds .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Different glucocorticoid hormones ( GCH ) show differences in the intensity and in the kinetics of their immunomodulating activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mechanism(s) of action of GCH is under investigation , but is has been noted that they exert immune activity via the genomic pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have studied the effects of prednisone ( PDN ) , deflazacort ( DFC ) , and dexamethasone ( DXM ) on the production of cytokines ( IL-2 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , IL-10 ) by peripheral T lymphocytes , and the effects on the inhibition of NF-kB DNA binding activity by activated Jurkat cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The data obtained show that the three GCH molecules exert an immunosuppression on cytokine production by T lymphocytes and a strong decrease in the nuclear translocation of NF-kB in Jurkat cells ; moreover , ( a ) not all the cytokines investigated were affected , and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> with the same intensity</scope> , by the three GCH and ( b ) DXM inhibited the binding activity of NF-kB less than that of DFC and PDN .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These data are in agreement with the concept that different GCH compounds <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> differ in their binding and affinity properties , tissue-specific metabolism , and interaction with transcription factor</scope> .</sentence>
