<sentence id="0">DISCUSSION</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Shortly after the discovery of APOBEC3G , it became clear that this human gene plays an important role in antiretroviral defense ( 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Originally identified as a restriction factor of HIV-1 infection , expression of APOBEC3G was found in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages , which represent the main target cells for HIV-1 ( 32 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , the protein was detected in lung , liver , spleen , testis and ovary , but little is known about its transcriptional regulation ( 29,32,47 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To address this question , we cloned the human APOBEC3G promoter and analyzed its regulation in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Applying 5=='==-RACE , we identified multiple start sites for transcription of the A3G gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This observation is consistent with the fact that <scope type="spec" id="1"> the gene <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> canonical CCAAT and TATA boxes ( 32 )</scope> , a condition often associated with multiple transcriptional start sites ( 49==-==51 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , one single start site was detected in 6 of 19 clones and was designated as +1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This TSS is located 66 bp upstream of the start of the published mRNA sequence ( GenBank==trade = = NM021822 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We cloned a 1025 bp promoter , which ranges from position = = -==959/+66 relative to the identified TSS .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Luciferase reporter assays showed that this promoter was transcriptionally active in A3.01 T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Treatment with the phorbol ester TPA did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> further enhance transcriptional activity</scope> , although upregulation of A3G mRNA levels in T cells by TPA has been described ( 33 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Rose et al. used actinomycin D to block further transcription and did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> find evidence for enhanced mRNA stability</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Therefore , the authors <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggested</cue> that an enhanced transcription rate <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> be responsible for the increased amount of A3G mRNA after TPA treatment</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">However , the promoter analysis we performed <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicates</cue> a different mechanism that is independent of transcriptional regulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">In addition , we observed that the A3G promoter was <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> inducible by IFN-==alpha = = or IFN-==gamma = = in A3.01 T cells</scope> , whereas in the hepatic cell line HepG2 , a moderate induction was measured .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">It has been described previously that A3G gene expression is upregulated by interferons in hepatocytes and macrophages ( 46==-==48 , 52 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">In this context , two interferon-responsive elements have been identified at the positions = = -==6/+9 and +1/+15 relative to the TSS ( 48 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Consistent with this data , we observed an interferon induction in hepatocytes for the fragments ranging between 1025 and 120 bp length .</sentence>
<sentence id="19"><scope type="neg" id="9">The activity of the 60 bp fragment that does <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> contain these motifs</scope> was <cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">Thus , the induction we observed was most <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">likely</cue> mediated by the described interferon-responsive elements</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">However , according to our results , these motifs <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">can</cue> enhance transcription in hepatic cells , but <scope type="neg" id="11"><cue type="neg" id="11">not</cue> in T cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">This is surprising , since IFN-==alpha==-inducible signaling cascades are present in A3.01 T cells : we showed that the control plasmid harboring interferon-responsive GAS elements was markedly induced by IFN-==alpha = = treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">In contrast , the GAS element was <scope type="neg" id="13"><cue type="neg" id="13">not</cue> responsive to IFN-==gamma = = treatment in these cells</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="15"> <cue type="spec" id="15">suggesting</cue> that our T cell line was <scope type="neg" id="14"><cue type="neg" id="14">not</cue> able to mediate IFN-==gamma==-induced signals</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">So far , enhanced A3G promoter activity by interferons is clearly described in hepatocytes and macrophages , whereas the situation in T cells is still <scope type="spec" id="16"> <cue type="spec" id="16">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="25">A recent study found <scope type="neg" id="17"><cue type="neg" id="17">no</cue> influence of IFN-==alpha = = or IFN-==gamma = = on A3G expression in resting primary blood lymphocytes ( 52 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="26">Another publication describes an enhanced expression of A3G after IFN-==alpha = = treatment in resting primary CD4 T cells , but <scope type="neg" id="18"><cue type="neg" id="18">not</cue> in activated T cells ( 53 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="27">This observation is <scope type="neg" id="19"><cue type="neg" id="19">not</cue> contradictory to our results since T cell lines are mitotically active and therefore rather in an activated than in a resting state</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="28">In conclusion , the current data <scope type="spec" id="20"> <cue type="spec" id="20">suggests</cue> that regulation of the A3G promoter activity by interferons is dependent on the cell type and <scope type="spec" id="21"> <cue type="spec" id="21">possibly</cue> also from the cellular activation status</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="29">We additionally analyzed the influence of HIV-1 proteins on A3G promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="30">The HIV-1 Vif protein is neutralizing the antiviral function of A3G by a multitude of ways .</sentence>
<sentence id="31">Targeting the A3G protein for proteasomal degradation is considered to be the main mode of action ( 37==-==41 ) , but it becomes more and more clear that other mechanisms are also involved .</sentence>
<sentence id="32">There is evidence that Vif also promotes exclusion of A3G from the virus particles and an influence on the A3G translation process is discussed ( 8,42,43 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="33"><scope type="neg" id="22">The question <scope type="spec" id="23"> <cue type="spec" id="23">whether</cue> Vif alters transcription controlled by the A3G promoter</scope> has <cue type="neg" id="22">not</cue> been analyzed so far</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="34">Our analysis <scope type="spec" id="24"> <cue type="spec" id="24">indicates that</cue> transcription from the A3G promoter is unaffected by Vif or other HIV-1 proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="35">Taken together , in T cell lines , the A3G promoter appears constitutively active .</sentence>
<sentence id="36">By generating a series of 5 = = ' = = deletions , we showed that the core promoter is located within the region = = -==114/+66 relative to the TSS .</sentence>
<sentence id="37">This 180 bp promoter was transcriptionally active in the lymphoid , myeloid and hepatic cell lines we tested , <scope type="spec" id="25"> <cue type="spec" id="25">indicating that</cue> ubiquitous transcription factors are involved in regulation of A3G gene transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="38">A GC-box with the sequence TGGGCGGGAC was identified at position = = -==87/==-==78 of the A3G promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="39">This GC-box is essential for basal promoter activity , since changing the motif to TGTTCGGGAC by introducing two point mutations strongly reduced A3G promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="40">The transcriptional potency of the GC-box was further demonstrated by cloning it upstream of an SV40 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="41">This resulted in a 4-fold enhanced transcription rate .</sentence>
<sentence id="42">The <scope type="spec" id="26"> <cue type="spec" id="26">hypothesis</cue> that a general transcription factor is involved in regulation of A3G transcription was confirmed by EMSA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="43">Supershift analysis showed that the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells , bind specifically to the identified motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="44">In addition , the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the endogenous A3G promoter was demonstrated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="45">This observation is consistent with the results of the 5=='==-RACE , since Sp1 is known to play an important role for RNA polymerase II to bind to the transcription initiation site in TATA-boxless promoters and is associated with multiple transcription initiation sites ( 54==-==56 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="46">We also tested <scope type="spec" id="27"> <cue type="spec" id="27">whether</cue> overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 proteins had an influence on A3G promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="47">Luciferase assays revealed that A3G promoter activities remained unchanged <scope type="neg" id="28">( data <cue type="neg" id="28">not</cue> shown )</scope> , most <scope type="spec" id="29"> <cue type="spec" id="29">probably</cue> due to the high basal expression level of the endogenous Sp1 and/or Sp3 proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="48">The Sp family of transcription factors is involved in transcriptional regulation of many housekeeping , tissue-specific , viral and inducible genes ( 57 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="49">Whereas Sp1 typically acts as an activator , Sp3 can serve as a repressor or activator ( 57 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="50">However , in the context of the A3G promoter , both transcription factors serve as activators , as shown by siRNA-mediated silencing of the single factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="51">Although siRNAs directed against Sp1 or Sp3 significantly reduced transcription controlled by the 180 bp promoter , <scope type="neg" id="30">transcriptional activity was <cue type="neg" id="30">not</cue> reduced to the level of the 150 bp fragment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="52">This can be explained by the remaining low amounts of Sp1/Sp3 proteins which can be seen in the western blot analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="53">Alternatively , other transcription factors could be involved in A3G regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="54">Our results also provide information about the regulation of APOBEC3F ( A3F ) , another member of the human APOBEC3 family .</sentence>
<sentence id="55">A3F is expressed in many human tissues that also express A3G and both proteins have been shown to form heteromultimers , which are most <scope type="spec" id="31"> <cue type="spec" id="31">likely</cue> generated through binding to an RNA intermediate ( 26,29,30 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="56">A3F only differs in 16 nt from the 560 nt upstream of the TSS of A3G ( GenBank==trade = = DQ146365 and DQ147772 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="57">The 180-bp core promoter region , which we identified for A3G has 100 % identity with the A3F sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="58">Therefore , Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors are most <scope type="spec" id="32"> <cue type="spec" id="32">likely</cue> also mediating basal transcription of the A3F gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="59">Our study revealed that the human A3G gene is controlled by a promoter with multiple transcriptional start sites .</sentence>
