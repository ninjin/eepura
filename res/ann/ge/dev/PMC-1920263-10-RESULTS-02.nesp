<sentence id="0">The core promoter of A3G is located within the region = = -==114/+66 relative to the TSS</sentence>
<sentence id="1">For characterization of the A3G promoter , we cloned the 1025 bp located at position = = -==959/+66 relative to the identified transcription start into the promoterless pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid and designated the plasmid pGL3-Basic-APOprom1025 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Similarly , pGL3-APOprom502 ( containing sequence = = -==436/+66 ) , pGL3-APOprom225 ( containing sequence = = -==159/+66 ) and further 5 = = ' = = deletion reporter constructs containing 180 , 150 , 120 or 60 bp upstream of position +65 were generated ( Figure 3A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to analyze transcriptional activity , the luciferase reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into A3.01 T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Luciferase assays revealed a = = approximately==20-fold increased transcriptional activity of the 1025 bp sequence as compared to the empty vector , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> we had identified an active A3G promoter sequence ( Figure 3B )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This transcription rate was not significantly altered by the 5 = = ' = = deletions leading to the 502 , 225 and 180 bp fragments ( Figure 3B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , a drop in luciferase activity was observed in the case of the 150 bp fragment .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This construct only retained 28 % of the transcriptional activity of the 180 bp promoter in A3.01 T cells and activity of the 120 bp fragment was further reduced .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Comparable reductions relative to the activity of 180 bp fragment were observed in the myeloid cell line U937 and the hepatic cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 ( Figure 3C ) , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the core promoter of A3G is located within the region = = -==114/+66 relative to the TSS</scope> .</sentence>
