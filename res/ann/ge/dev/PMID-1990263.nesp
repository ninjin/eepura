<sentence id="0">Nuclear factor kappa B activates proenkephalin transcription in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Upon activation , T lymphocytes accumulate high levels of the neuropeptide enkephalin which correlate with high levels of proenkephalin mRNA in the cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we investigated the transcriptional basis for these changes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The proenkephalin promoter contains a sequence GGGGACGTCCCC , named B2 , which is similar to the kappa B sequence GGGGACTTTCC , the binding site of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. Activation of T lymphocytes induces an NF-kappa B-like binding activity to the B2 site , concomitant with activation of the proenkephalin promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutations at the B2 site abolish this transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The purified homodimer ( two p50s ) of the DNA-binding subunit of NF-kappa B binds the B2 site of proenkephalin relatively better than does the heterotetramer ( two p65s plus two p50s ) form of the factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , it <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> that the T-cell-specific activation of the proenkephalin promoter is mediated by NF-kappa B. However , as NF-kappa B is ubiquitous and the transcriptional activation through the B2 site is T cell specific , <scope type="spec" id="1"> yet another T-cell-specific factor which synergizes with NF-kappa B <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> be considered</scope></scope> .</sentence>
