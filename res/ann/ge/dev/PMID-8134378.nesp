<sentence id="0">Activation of the interleukin 6 gene by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or lipopolysaccharide is mediated by nuclear factors NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B [ published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1995 Apr 11 ; 92(8):3632 ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis includes granuloma formation at sites of infection and systemic symptoms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Cytokines have been identified by immunohistochemistry in granulomas in animal models of bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) infection and are released by mononuclear phagocytes upon stimulation by mycobacterial proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this regard , the cytokine interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> play a role in the clinical manifestations and pathological events of tuberculosis infection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have demonstrated that lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) from the mycobacterial cell wall , which was virtually devoid of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , stimulated mononuclear phagocytes to release IL-6 in a dose-response manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">LAM and LPS were potent inducers of IL-6 gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Both LAM- and LPS-inducible IL-6 promoter activity was localized to a DNA fragment , positions -158 to -49 , by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Two nuclear factor NF-IL6 ( positions -153 to -145 and -83 to -75 ) and one nuclear factor NF-kappa B ( positions -72 to -63 ) motifs are present within this fragment .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Site-directed mutagenesis of one or more of these motifs within the IL-6 promoter demonstrated that each has positive regulatory activity and that they could act in a function- and orientation-independent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Deletion of all three elements abolished inducibility of IL-6 promoter activity by both LAM and LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We conclude that the NF-IL6 and NF-kappa B sites mediate IL-6 induction in response to both LPS and LAM , acting as bacterial or mycobacterial response elements .</sentence>
