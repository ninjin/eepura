<sentence id="0">Human T lymphotropic virus-I infection of human T lymphocytes induces expression of the beta-galactoside-binding lectin , galectin-3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Animal lectins play important roles in a variety of biological processes via their recognition of glycoconjugates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding lectin previously designated as epsilon BP ( IgE-binding protein ) , CBP35 , Mac-2 , L-29 , and L-34 , and its expression has been associated with various physiological and pathological processes , including cell growth , tumor transformation , and metastasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Galectin-3 is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types and is expressed in many leukocytes , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">with the</cue> notable exception of B and T lymphocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We now report that galectin-3 is abundantly expressed in a number of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I-infected human T cell lines , including F6T , HUT 102 , K3T , MT-2 , and SLB-I , but is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> expressed in non-HTLV-I-infected T cell lines such as Jurkat , CEM , and MOLT-4</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , the galectin-3 level was markedly increased in human thymocytes after infection with HTLV-I as compared with uninfected thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="2"> The up-regulation of galectin-3 expression <cue type="spec" id="2">appeared</cue> to correlate well with HTLV-I gene expression</scope> , as undetectable or very low levels of galectin-3 were found in the S1T and ATL-1K cell lines , which are nonproductively infected with HTLV-I .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In co-transfection experiments , the galectin-3 promoter was significantly up-regulated by expression vectors encoding the 40-kd Tax protein , a potent transactivator in HTLV-I .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Analysis of various Tax mutants <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> that galectin-3 promoter induction is dependent on activation of the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation transcription factor family of transcription factors and , to a lesser extent , nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel induction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Transfection of human promonocytic U-937 cells with an HTLV-I Tax expression vector induced galectin-3 expression in this cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Functionally , galectin-3 was shown to activate interleukin-2 production in Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">raise the</cue> possibility that HTLV-I Tax production induces the transcription and subsequent synthesis and secretion of galectin-3 , which in turn <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> further activate these T cells and contribute to the altered properties of cell growth found in adult T cell leukemia induced by HTLV-I</scope></scope> .</sentence>
