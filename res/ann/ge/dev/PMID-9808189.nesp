<sentence id="0">Decreased IL-12 production and Th1 cell development by acetyl salicylic acid-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-12 is a 75-kDa heterodimeric cytokine composed of two covalently linked p35 and p40 chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This pro-inflammatory cytokine plays a prominent role in the development of Th1 cell-mediated immune responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Th1 cell-mediated immune responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="0"> IL-12 <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be a critical factor in the generation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we investigated the effects of a commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory drug , acetyl salicylic acid ( ASA ) , on IL-12 production and Th1 cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">ASA was found to inhibit secretion of the IL-12 heterodimer as well as p40 monomer by human monocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This was associated with the down-regulation of IL-12p40 mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Analysis of the regulation of the p40 gene promoter revealed that ASA inhibited NF-kappaB activation and binding to the p40-kappaB site in the p40 promoter , leading to transcriptional repression of the p40 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Addition of ASA to an in vitro T helper cell differentiation system , at concentrations compatible with plasma levels reached during anti-inflammatory therapy , resulted in reduced development of Th1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by ASA leads to down-regulation of IL-12 production and inhibition of Th1 cell development</scope> .</sentence>
