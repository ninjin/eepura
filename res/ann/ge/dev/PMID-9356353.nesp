<sentence id="0">TNFalpha cooperates with the protein kinase A pathway to synergistically increase HIV-1 LTR transcription via downstream TRE-like cAMP response elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding TPA responsive elements ( TRE ) are located downstream of the transcription initiation site in the U5 region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These downstream sequence elements , termed DSE , can bind both AP-1 and CREB/ATF transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , we demonstrated that the DSE are also cAMP-responsive elements ( CRE ) , since they mediated activation signals elicited by cholera toxin ( Ctx ) , a potent activator of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) signal transduction pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , we demonstrate that the HIV-1 DSE can mediate the transcriptional synergy elicited by the combination of Ctx and TNFalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Ctx combined with TNFalpha or IL-1beta to produce a synergistic increase in p24 antigen production in U1 promonocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transfection studies of LTR reporter constructs indicated that mutation of the DSE sites abrogated the LTR-mediated synergy induced by Ctx and TNFalpha , whereas the synergy induced by Ctx and IL-1beta was unaffected , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> TNFalpha and IL-1beta cooperate differently with the cAMP/PKA activation pathway to induce HIV-1 expression in U1 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Because the DSE are also TRE sites , we assessed the effect of the agonist combinations on AP-1-dependent transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">TNFalpha as well as IL-1beta cooperated with Ctx to produce a synergistic activation of AP-1-mediated transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the TRE-like cAMP-responsive DSE sites within the 5'-untranslated leader can mediate the transcriptional cooperativity between TNFalpha and the cAMP/PKA pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Since the DSE and TRE sites cannot bind CREB/ATF homodimers , we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> a mechanism in which the HIV-1 DSE bind heterodimers composed of both AP-1 and CREB/ATF proteins</scope> .</sentence>
