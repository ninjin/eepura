<sentence id="0">Characterization of the transcriptional start sites of APOBEC3G by 5=='==-RACE</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To identify the transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) of APOBEC3G ( A3G ) in A3.01 T cells , we performed 5=='==-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis ( RACE ) with A3G-specific primers ( see Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Agarose gel electrophoresis resolved the nested PCR products into three bands of different electrophoretic mobility with a dominant middle band ( Figure 2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For each band , the DNA was cloned and sequence analysis of six or seven individual transformants was performed .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We observed that the transcriptional start sites of the A3G gene were located between 58 and 361 nt upstream of the ATG start codon ( Figure 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although TSS were variable and most sites were only detected once among the 19 clones analyzed , one TSS was identified in six individual clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This TSS was located 66 nt upstream of the start of the published A3G mRNA sequence ( GenBank==trade = = accession number NM021822 ) and we defined this position as the major transcriptional start site of the A3G gene .</sentence>
