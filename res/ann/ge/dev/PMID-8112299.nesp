<sentence id="0">Calcineurin acts in synergy with PMA to inactivate I kappa B/MAD3 , an inhibitor of NF-kappa B.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter consists of several independent T cell receptor ( TcR ) responsive elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The induction of promoters dependent on these elements is inhibitable by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and tacrolimus ( FK-506 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Calcineurin , a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase , is the FK-506- and CsA-sensitive enzyme required for TcR mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We report that a constitutively active form of calcineurin partially substitutes for the Ca2+ co-stimulus required to activate the IL-2 promoter elements IL-2A ( which binds the factors OAP and Oct-1 ) and IL-2E ( which binds NF-AT ) , and completely substitutes for the Ca2+ co-stimulus required to stimulate an NF-kappa B-dependent element .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Calcineurin stimulates the NF-kappa B element by enhancing inactivation of I kappa B/MAD3 , an inhibitor of NF-kappa B , thereby increasing the amount of nuclear NF-kappa B DNA binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data provide the first demonstration in vivo that activation of a protein phosphatase can inactivate I kappa B , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> one <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> explanation for mechanism-based toxicities associated with FK-506 and CsA</scope> by demonstrating that these drugs can inhibit the calcineurin-dependent activation of a virtually ubiquitous transcription factor</scope> .</sentence>
