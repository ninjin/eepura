<sentence id="1">Protein kinase D serine kinases have been proposed to regulate diverse cellular functions including the phosphorylation and nuclear localisation of class II HDACs and the phosphorylation of HSP27 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has also been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that PKDs act as mitochondrial sensors for oxidative stress and play a role in regulating NF==kappa==B transcription factors [ 41</scope> ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Most of the data about the function of PKDs has come from experiments that ectopically express active or inhibitory PKD mutants or that use RNAi to reduce PKD expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have used gene targeting to specifically delete PKD alleles in DT40 chicken B cells and can thus use PKD-null DT40 cells to assess the relative contribution of individual PKD isoforms in class II HDAC control versus oxidative stress responses and NF==kappa==B regulation in lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have previously used these PKD-null DT40 cells to define an essential role for PKDs in regulation of class II HDACs , the present report now describes an indispensable role for PKDs in regulating the phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82 , a site previously identified as a target for the p38-MAPKAPK2 signalling cascade [ 42 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , studies of PKD-null DT40 cells reveal that PKD family kinases are <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> essential for oxidative stress survival responses <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">nor</cue> are they required for activation of NF==kappa==B transcription factors</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These latter findings are in striking contrast to previous observations in HeLa and epithelial cell lines where overexpression/RNAi approaches have implicated PKD1/2 in the control of proliferation , survival and NF==kappa==B activation [ 20,23 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Hence , the present report shows that the proposed roles for PKDs as key sensors that modulate survival pathways in response to oxidative stress and regulate cell survival and proliferation are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> ubiquitous</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be restricted to certain cell lineages</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , these data <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicate that</cue> loss of expression of PKD family members does <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> globally impact on early BCR-regulated signalling pathways</scope></scope> .</sentence>
