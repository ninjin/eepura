<sentence id="0">Positive and negative regulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoter activity by AML1-related transcription factor , PEBP2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene promoter contains a consensus sequence for the polyomavirus enhancer binding-protein 2 ( PEBP2 ) transcription factor , which consists of alpha and beta subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">There are at least two genes , alpha A and alpha B , encoding the alpha subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">alpha B is the mouse homologue of human AML1 gene detected at the breakpoints of t(8 ; 21 ) and t(3 ; 21 ) myeloid leukemias .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We examined alpha A1 ( an alpha A-gene product ) and alpha B1 and alpha B2 ( two alpha B-encoded isomers ) for their effects on the GM-CSF promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">PEBP2 alpha A1 , alpha B1 , and alpha B2 proteins bound the PEBP2 site within the mouse GM-CSF promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">PEBP2 alpha A1 and alpha B1 enhanced the expression of the GM-CSF promoter-driven reporter plasmid in unstimulated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate/phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human Jurkat T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , the promoter activity was suppressed by alpha B2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Coexpression of alpha B1 and alpha B2 showed that the promoter activity could be determined by the alpha B1/alpha B2 ratio .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Jurkat cell extract contained PEBP2 site-binding protein(s) that cross-reacted with antimouse alpha A1 antibodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Northern blot analysis indicated the expression of human PEBP2 alpha A , alpha B ( AML1 ) , and beta genes in Jurkat cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Although further studies are required to determine the precise role of PEBP2 in the GM-CSF promoter activity , the present findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> the importance of the relative ratio of different PEBP2 isoforms in regulating the levels of the promoter activity</scope> .</sentence>
