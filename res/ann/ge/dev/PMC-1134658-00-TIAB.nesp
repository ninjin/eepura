<sentence id="0">BMP-6 inhibits growth of mature human B cells ; induction of Smad phosphorylation and upregulation of Id1</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Background</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) belong to the TGF-==beta = = superfamily and are secreted proteins with pleiotropic roles in many different cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="1"> A <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> role of BMP-6 in the immune system</scope> has been <cue type="spec" id="1">implied</cue> by various studies of malignant and rheumatoid diseases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , we explored the role of BMP-6 in normal human peripheral blood B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Results</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The B cells were found to express BMP type I and type II receptors and BMP-6 rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , Smad-phosphorylation was followed by upregulation of Id1 mRNA and Id1 protein , whereas <scope type="neg" id="2">Id2 and Id3 expression was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , we found that BMP-6 had an antiproliferative effect both in na==i==ve ( CD19+CD27- ) and memory B cells ( CD19+CD27+ ) stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Additionally , BMP-6 induced cell death in activated memory B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Importantly , the antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in B-cells was completely neutralized by the natural antagonist , noggin .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Furthermore , B cells were demonstrated to upregulate BMP-6 mRNA upon stimulation with anti-IgM .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Conclusion</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In mature human B cells , BMP-6 inhibited cell growth , and rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 followed by an upregulation of Id1 .</sentence>
