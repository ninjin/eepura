<sentence id="0">Silencing of Sp1 and Sp3 reduces A3G promoter activity</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To confirm the role of Sp1 and Sp3 in regulation of A3G promoter activity , we silenced their translation via RNA interference .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Functionality of the siRNAs directed against Sp1 or Sp3 was confirmed by western blot analysis : protein levels of Sp1 as well as the long and short isoforms of Sp3 were strongly reduced in the presence of 150 or 300 ng specific siRNA ( Figure 7A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An unspecific control siRNA had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> influence ( Figure 7A</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We then cotransfected the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 180 bp A3G promoter together with 100 ng siRNA using an optimized protocol for the cotransfection of plasmid plus siRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This resulted in a 31==-==43 % reduction of luciferase activity in the presence of Sp1- or Sp3-specific siRNA compared to the control siRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> influence on transcriptional activity of the 150 bp fragment , which does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> contain the Sp1/Sp3-binding motif</scope></scope> , was observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , both Sp1 and Sp3 factors are mediating transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter .</sentence>
