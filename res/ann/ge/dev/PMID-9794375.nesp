<sentence id="0">Uncoupling activation-dependent HS1 phosphorylation from nuclear factor of activated T cells transcriptional activation in Jurkat T cells : differential signaling through CD3 and the costimulatory receptors CD2 and CD28 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD3 , CD2 , and CD28 are functionally distinct receptors on T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Engagement of any of these receptors induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a shared group of intracellular signaling proteins , including Vav , Cbl , p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase , and the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Ligation of CD3 also induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 , a 75-kDa hematopoietic cell-specific intracellular signaling protein of <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have examined changes in HS1 phosphorylation after differential stimulation of CD3 , CD2 , and CD28 to elucidate its role in T cells and to further delineate the signaling pathways recruited by these receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Unlike ligation of CD3 , stimulation with anti-CD28 mAb or CHO cells expressing the CD28 ligands CD80 or CD86 did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in Jurkat T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was induced by mitogenic pairs of anti-CD2 mAbs capable of activating the transcription factor NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Costimulation through CD28 and/or CD2 did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> modulate the CD3-dependent phosphorylation of HS1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In vivo studies <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicated that</cue> CD3-induced HSI phosphorylation was dependent upon both the Src family tyrosine kinase Lck and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45 , did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> require MEK1 kinase activity</scope> , and was regulated by protein kinase C activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , although CD3 , CD28 , and CD2 activate many of the same signaling molecules , they differed in their capacity to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of HSI .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , activation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> required for NFAT transcriptional activation</scope> .</sentence>
