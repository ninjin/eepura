<sentence id="0">Cupric ion blocks NF kappa B activation through inhibiting the signal-induced phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A transcription factor NF kappa B , which regulates expression of various cellular genes involved in immune responses and viral genes including HIV , is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a complex with an inhibitory protein I kappa B. Various extracellular signals induce phosphorylation and rapid degradation of I kappa B alpha to release NF kappa B. Cu2+ was found to inhibit the activation of NF kappa B induced by TNF-alpha , TPA , or H2O2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Deoxycholate treatment of the cytoplasmic extract prepared from cells stimulated by TNF-alpha in the presence of Cu2+ resulted in the release of NF kappa B from I kappa B alpha , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> Cu2+ interferes with the dissociation of the NF kappa B-I kappa B complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Neither phosphorylation nor degradation of I kappa B alpha was observed upon TNF-alpha stimulation in the presence of Cu2+ .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> Cu2+ inhibits the release of NF kappa B by blockade of a signal leading to the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha</scope> .</sentence>
