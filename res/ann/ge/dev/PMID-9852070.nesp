<sentence id="0">The involvement of multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factors in the signaling mechanisms of receptor activator of NF-kappaB , a member of the TNFR superfamily .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ( RANK ) is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is expressed on activated T cells and dendritic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Its cognate ligand ( RANKL ) plays significant roles in the activation of dendritic cell function and osteoclast differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate here the interaction of RANK with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors ( TRAFs ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 both in vitro and in cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mapping of the structural requirements for TRAF/RANK interaction revealed multiple TRAF binding sites clustered in two distinct domains in the RANK cytoplasmic tail .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These TRAF binding domains were shown to be functionally important for the RANK-dependent induction of NF-kappaB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these TRAF binding sites exhibited selective binding for different TRAF proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In particular , TRAF6 interacted with membrane-proximal determinants distinct from those binding TRAFs 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">When this membrane-proximal TRAF6 interaction domain was deleted , RANK-mediated NF-kappaB signaling was completely inhibited while c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation was partially inhibited .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">An NH2-terminal truncation mutant of TRAF6 inhibited RANKL-mediated NF-kappaB activation , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to affect constitutive signaling induced by receptor overexpression</scope> , revealing a selective role for TRAF6 in ligand-induced activation events .</sentence>
