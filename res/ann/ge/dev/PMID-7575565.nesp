<sentence id="1">We have examined binding of the nuclear protein HMG-I to the human gamma-globin promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We find that HMG-I binds preferentially to the more 3' of a pair of GATA motifs in the gamma-globin promoter ; this paired motif is bound by the erythroid factor GATA-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A naturally occurring mutation ( -175 T-C ) in the area bound by HMG-I results in overexpression of gamma-globin in adult red blood cells ( HPFH ) and up-regulation of the gamma-globin promoter in in vitro expression assays ; HMG-I does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> bind to this mutant sequence</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A survey of GATA motifs from other globin cis-elements demonstrates HMG-I binding to most of them .</sentence>
