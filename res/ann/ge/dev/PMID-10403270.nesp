<sentence id="0">Monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies from a patient with Takayasu arteritis activate endothelial cells from large vessels .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : To create monoclonal anti-endothelial cell antibodies ( mAECA ) from a patient with Takayasu arteritis to evaluate their ability to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , and to characterize the mechanism of EC activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">METHODS : A panel of mAECA was generated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with Takayasu arteritis , using Epstein-Barr virus transformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Activity against macrovascular EC ( HUVEC ) and microvascular EC ( human bone marrow EC immortalized by SV40 ) antigens was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Inhibition studies were used to select the monoclonal antibodies ( mAECA ) which share the same EC epitope binding specificity as the total IgG-AECA from the Takayasu arteritis patient .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The binding of the mAECA to human aortic EC was studied by immunohistochemistry .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The secretion levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) were determined , to serve as markers for EC activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The activated EC were examined for the adherence of a monocytic cell line ( U937 ) , as well as for expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 , and E-selectin .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , nuclear extracts of the mAECA-treated EC were analyzed for the induction of translocation of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , using a specific NF-kappaB oligoprobe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">RESULTS : Six mAECA were selected , the mixture of which produced 100 % inhibition of binding of the original IgG ( from the patient with Takayasu arteritis ) to HUVEC .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">All mAECA possessed high activity against macrovascular EC , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">none</cue> had significant antimicrovascular EC activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The mAECA , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> normal human IgG</scope> , had anti-human aortic EC activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Four of the 6 mAECA activated EC , manifested by increased IL-6 and vWF secretion .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The 4 mAECA induced EC expression of adhesion molecules and increased adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to EC .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">In addition , these mAECA stimulated the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">CONCLUSION : Our findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that AECA <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> directly stimulate EC in Takayasu arteritis through elevation of adhesion molecule expression associated with NF-kappaB activation and adhesion of monocytes</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> therefore play a pathogenic role in the development of the vasculopathy in Takayasu arteritis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
