<sentence id="0">The retinoblastoma gene product negatively regulates transcriptional activation mediated by the human cytomegalovirus IE2 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The IE2 gene product of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is one of a few viral regulatory proteins expressed immediately upon infection of the host cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is a potent transcriptional activator of many viral and cellular promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product ( Rb ) dramatically suppressed this IE2 transactivation of various promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , unlike another tumor suppressor protein , p53 , Rb did not have any significant effect on basal levels of transcription , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that Rb specifically interacts with IE2 <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> other cellular factors involved in the general transcription machinery</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found by protein-affinity chromatography that Rb in nuclear extracts or produced by in vitro translation directly bound to IE2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that Rb <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> regulate the life cycle of HCMV , which is endemic in the human population</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , these data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> provide new insights into the slow rate of HCMV DNA replication in cells and the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possible</cue> involvement of HCMV in tumorigenesis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
