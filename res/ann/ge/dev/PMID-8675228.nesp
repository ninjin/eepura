<sentence id="0">Interleukin 10 induced c-fos expression in human B cells by activation of divergent protein kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IL-10 is a potent mediator of human B cell growth and plasma cell formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , signal transduction of IL-10 in B cells is poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study the effect of IL-10 on the expression of the protooncogene c-fos was investigated , because Fos plays a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> role in the regulation of B cell proliferation and differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">B cells were purified from buffy coat preparations of healthy blood donors by positive selection using an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody and a MiniMACS separation unit .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">B cells were prestimulated with SAC for 48 hrs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Then , cells were incubated with medium or IL-10 ( 100 ng/ml ) for 10 to 120 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform and c-fos expression was analyzed by PCR assisted mRNA assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A significant 2-4 fold increase of c-fos expression was observed within 30 min of stimulation with IL-10 ( p < 0.01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">After 2 hrs c-fos expression declined to basal levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The effect of IL-10 was dose-dependent with a maximum stimulation using 100 ng/ml of IL-10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="neg" id="1">The IL-10 effect on c-fos expression was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> blocked by polymyxin B. Using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein ( 10 microM ) a complete inhibition of IL-10 induced c-fos expression was observed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In addition , H-7 ( 10 microM ) , a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases , significantly blocked IL-10 mediated c-fos expression ( p < 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In conclusion , these data show that IL-10 induces c-fos expression in human B-cells by activation of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Since this is the first report on IL-10 induced signal transduction , these data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> help to identify the intracellular mechanisms by which IL-10 stimulates human B-cells</scope> .</sentence>
