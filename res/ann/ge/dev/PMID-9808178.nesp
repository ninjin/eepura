<sentence id="0">Effects of overexpression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase on NFkappaB activation , IL-2 production and stress-activated protein kinases in the murine T cell line EL4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The association and activation of the IL-1 receptor-associated protein kinase ( IRAK ) to the IL-1 receptor complex is one of the earliest events detectable in IL-1 signal transduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We generated permanent clones of the murine T cell line EL4 6.1 overexpressing human (h)IRAK to evaluate the role of this kinase in IL-1 signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Overexpression of hIRAK enhanced IL-1-stimulated activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB , whereas a truncated form ( N-IRAK ) specifically inhibited IL-1-dependent NFkappaB activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In clones stably overexpressing hIRAK a weak constitutive activation of NFkappaB correlated with a low basal IL-2 production which was enhanced in an IL-1-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Compared to the parental cell line the dose-response curve of IL-1-induced IL-2 production was shifted in both potency and efficacy .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results demonstrate that IRAK directly triggers NFkappaB-mediated gene expression in EL4 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Qualitatively different effects were observed for the IL-1-induced activation of stress-activated protein ( SAP ) kinases : permanent overexpression of IRAK did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affect the dose dependence</scope> but prolonged the kinetics of IL-1-induced activation of SAP kinases , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that this signaling branch <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be regulated by distinct mechanisms</scope></scope> .</sentence>
