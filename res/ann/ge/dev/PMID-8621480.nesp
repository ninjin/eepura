<sentence id="0">A hydrophobic domain of Ca2+-modulating cyclophilin ligand modulates calcium influx signaling in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ca2+-modulating cyclophilin ligand ( CAML ) was originally described as a cyclophilin B-binding protein whose overexpression in T cells causes a rise in intracellular calcium , thus activating transcription factors responsible for the early immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As reported here , structure-function analysis of the CAML gene in Jurkat T cells <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> two of CAML 's <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> membrane-spanning domains</scope> are necessary and sufficient for the modulation of intracellular calcium</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> that the hydrophobic C-terminal tail of CAML forms its effector domain , thus implicating the N-terminal hydrophilic domain in a regulatory role</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These findings define a novel protein motif that functions in intracellular calcium signaling .</sentence>
