<sentence id="0">Apoptosis signaling pathways in normal T cells : differential activity of Bcl-2 and IL-1beta-converting enzyme family protease inhibitors on glucocorticoid- and Fas-mediated cytotoxicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Fas-mediated apoptosis plays an important role in regulating the immune response in peripheral T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Restimulation of T cell blasts up-regulates Fas and Fas ligand expression , with subsequent interaction leading to cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Overexpression of Bcl-2 in tumor cells blocks apoptosis induced by many stimuli , but <scope type="neg" id="0">inhibition of Fas-mediated killing has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been consistently observed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To examine the behavior of Bcl-2 in normal cells , T cell blasts were transiently transfected with Bcl-2 and related gene products to determine the effect on apoptotic signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transient overexpression of Bcl-2 in mouse and human T cell blasts did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> block Fas-mediated apoptosis</scope> , whereas etoposide- and glucocorticoid-induced cytotoxicity was potently inhibited .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Expression of Bcl-xL and adenovirus E1B 19K did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> interfere with anti-Fas killing</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme family protease inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO and CrmA blocked Fas-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that peripheral T cells use distinct apoptosis signaling pathways with differential sensitivity to Bcl-2 and interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme family protease inhibitors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Since T cells normally express Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL following activation , their inability to block Fas-mediated apoptosis <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> allow for the elimination of self-reactive cells and the appropriate regulation of immune responses</scope> .</sentence>
