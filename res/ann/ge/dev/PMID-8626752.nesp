<sentence id="0">Preassociation of STAT1 with STAT2 and STAT3 in separate signalling complexes prior to cytokine stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A variety of cytokines and growth factors act through an induction of gene expression mediated by a family of latent transcription factors called STAT ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs promotes their homodimer and heterodimer formation and subsequent nuclear translocation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate here that STAT protein heterocomplexes exist prior to cytokine treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When unstimulated HeLa cells are ruptured in hypotonic buffer <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> salt or detergent</scope> , immunoadsorption of either STAT1 or STAT2 from the resulting cytosol yields coimmunoadsorption of the other STAT protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Similarly , STAT1-STAT3 heterocomplexes are coimmunoadsorbed from hypotonic cytosol .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">STAT1 and STAT2 or STAT1 and STAT3 translated in reticulocyte lysate spontaneously form heterocomplexes when the translation lysates are mixed at 0 degrees C. Our data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that interferon-alpha / beta-induced tyrosine phosphorylation increases the stability of a preexisting , latent , STAT1-STAT2 signaling complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Newly translated STAT1 binds in equilibrium fashion to STAT2 and STAT3 , but we show that STAT2 and STAT3 exist in separate heterocomplexes with STAT1 , consistent with a model in which STAT1 contains a common binding site for other STAT proteins .</sentence>
