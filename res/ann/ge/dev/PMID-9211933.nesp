<sentence id="0">Lipopolysaccharide induction of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in human monocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulation by Egr-1 , c-Jun , and NF-kappaB transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) is predominantly by cells of the monocytic lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This study examined the role of various cis-acting regulatory elements in the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induction of the human TNF-alpha promoter in cells of monocytic lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Functional analysis of monocytic THP-1 cells transfected with plasmids containing various lengths of TNF-alpha promoter localized enhancer elements in a region ( -182 to -37 base pairs ( bp ) ) that were required for optimal transcription of the TNF-alpha gene in response to LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Two regions were identified : region I ( -182 to -162 bp ) contained an overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 site , and region II ( -119 to -88 ) contained CRE and NF-kappaB ( designated kappaB3 ) sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In unstimulated THP-1 , CRE-binding protein and , to a lesser extent , c-Jun complexes were found to bind to the CRE site .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">LPS stimulation increased the binding of c-Jun-containing complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , LPS stimulation induced the binding of cognate nuclear factors to the Egr-1 and kappaB3 sites , which were identified as Egr-1 and p50/p65 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The CRE and kappaB3 sites in region II together conferred strong LPS responsiveness to a heterologous promoter , whereas individually they <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to provide transcriptional activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , increasing the spacing between the CRE and the kappaB3 sites completely abolished LPS induction , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a cooperative interaction between c-Jun complexes and p50/p65</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These studies <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> maximal LPS induction of the TNF-alpha promoter is mediated by concerted participation of at least two separate cis-acting regulatory elements</scope> .</sentence>
