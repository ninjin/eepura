<sentence id="0">The Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 engages the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated proteins TRADD and receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) but does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> induce apoptosis or require RIP for NF-kappaB activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A site in the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) transforming protein LMP1 that constitutively associates with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein TRADD to mediate NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is critical for long-term lymphoblastoid cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now find that LMP1 signaling through TRADD differs from TNFR1 signaling through TRADD .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">LMP1 needs only 11 amino acids to activate NF-kappaB or synergize with TRADD in NF-kappaB activation , while TNFR1 requires approximately 70 residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Further , LMP1 does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> require TRADD residues 294 to 312 for NF-kappaB activation</scope> , while TNFR1 requires TRADD residues 296 to 302 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">LMP1 is partially blocked for NF-kappaB activation by a TRADD mutant consisting of residues 122 to 293 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Unlike TNFR1 , LMP1 can interact directly with receptor-interacting protein ( RIP ) and stably associates with RIP in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Surprisingly , LMP1 does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> require RIP for NF-kappaB activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Despite constitutive association with TRADD or RIP , LMP1 does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> induce apoptosis in EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma or human embryonic kidney 293 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results add a different perspective to the molecular interactions through which LMP1 , TRADD , and RIP participate in B-lymphocyte activation and growth .</sentence>
