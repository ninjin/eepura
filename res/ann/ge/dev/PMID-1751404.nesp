<sentence id="0">The role of jun and fos gene family members in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced hemopoietic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Terminal differentiation of the leukemic cell lines U-937 and HL-60 by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is accompanied by marked changes in gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we demonstrate that the expression of jun and fos gene family members is induced with variable kinetics during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced differentiation , with c-jun expression best paralleling differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The generation of AP-1 complexes , as measured by DNA binding activity , closely parallels morphological differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , the ability of these complexes to regulate gene expression is demonstrated by increased transcription from an AP-1 driven reporter construct and marked increases in the expression of endogenous AP-1 regulated genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Differentiation assays using water soluble phorbol esters reveal that differentiation becomes irreversible soon after AP-1 appears .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This tight correlation between c-jun expression , the generation of AP-1 activity , and differentiation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> a critical role for this gene and transcriptional complex during this process</scope> .</sentence>
