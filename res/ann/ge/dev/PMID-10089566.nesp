<sentence id="0">Involvement of adenylate cyclase and p70(S6)-kinase activation in IL-10 up-regulation in human monocytes by gp41 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Our previous results show that recombinant gp41 ( aa565-647 ) , the extracellular domain of HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein , stimulates interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) production in human monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The signal cascade transducing this effect is <cue type="spec" id="0">not</cue> yet clear</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we examined <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation is mediated by the previously described synergistic activation of cAMP and NF-kappaB pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">gp41 induced cAMP accumulation in monocytes in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 suppressed gp41-induced IL-10 production in monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , gp41 <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">failed</cue> to stimulate NF-kappaB binding activity in as much as <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> NF-kappaB bound to the main NF-kappaB-binding site 2 of the IL-10 promoter after addition of gp41</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also examined the involvement of other signal transduction pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Specific inhibitors of p70(S6)-kinase ( rapamycin ) , and Gi protein ( pertussis toxin ) , prevented induction of IL-10 production by gp41 in monocytes , while inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI 3-kinase ) ( wortmannin ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway ( PD 98059 ) did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus HIV-1 gp41-induced IL-10 up-regulation in monocytes <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> involve NF-kappaB , MAPK , or PI 3-kinase activation</scope></scope> , but rather <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> operate through activation of adenylate cyclase and pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein to effect p70(S6)-kinase activation</scope> .</sentence>
