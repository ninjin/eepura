<sentence id="0">The lymphotoxin promoter is stimulated by HTLV-I tax activation of NF-kappa B in human T-cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The HTLV-I transcriptional activator tax was used to gain insight into the mechanism of lymphotoxin ( LT ; TNF-beta ) gene induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tax-expressing cell lines produce LT biologic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An LT promoter ( LT-293 ) CAT construct that contained an NF-kappa B site was active in the LT-producing C81-66-45 cell line , which contains defective HTLV-I but expresses tax .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The observation that a mutated LT-kappa B construct ( M1-CAT ) was inactive in C81-66-45 , confirmed the importance of NF-kappa B in LT gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Tax was transfected into HTLV-I-negative human T-cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Jurkat T cells stably expressing tax contained elevated levels of NF-kappa B that directly bound to the LT-kappa B site .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Tax co-transfected with reporter constructs into Jurkat cells maximally activated HTLV-I-LTR-CAT and kappa B-fos-CAT and also activated LT-293 to a lesser extent .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In JM T cells , tax induced LT-293 activity by two- to four-fold , though there was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> induction of M1-CAT</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The increase in LT-293 CAT activity mirrored the increase in LT biologic activity seen under these conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These studies , the first to demonstrate induction of LT promoter activity over basal levels , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> HTLV-I tax causes low-level activation of both endogenous LT and the LT promoter , at least in part through activation of NF-kappa B.</scope></sentence>
