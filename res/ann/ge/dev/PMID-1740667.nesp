<sentence id="0"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The AP-1 site at -150 bp , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> the NF-kappa B site</scope> , is <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to represent the major target of protein kinase C in the interleukin 2 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Stimulation of T cells with antigen results in activation of several kinases , including protein kinase C ( PKC ) , that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> mediate the later induction of activation-related genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have examined the potential role of PKC in induction of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) gene in T cells stimulated through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have previously shown that prolonged treatment of the untransformed T cell clone Ar-5 with phorbol esters results in downmodulation of the alpha and beta isozymes of PKC , and abrogates induction of IL-2 mRNA and protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that phorbol ester treatment also abolishes induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in Ar-5 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter linked to this reporter gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The IL-2 promoter contains binding sites for nuclear factors including NFAT-1 , Oct , NF-kappa B , and AP-1 , which are all <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potentially</cue> sensitive to activation of PKC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that induction of a trimer of the NFAT and Oct sites is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> sensitive to phorbol ester treatment</scope> , and that mutations in the NF-kappa B site have <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> effect on inducibility of the IL-2 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , mutations in the AP-1 site located at -150 bp almost completely abrogate induction of the IL-2 promoter , and appearance of an inducible nuclear factor binding to this site is sensitive to PKC depletion .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , cotransfections with c-fos and c-jun expression plasmids markedly enhance induction of the IL-2 promoter in minimally stimulated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicate that</cue> the AP-1 site at -150 bp represents a major , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">if not</cue> the only</scope> , site of PKC responsiveness in the IL-2 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
