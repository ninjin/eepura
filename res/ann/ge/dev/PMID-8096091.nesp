<sentence id="0">NF-kappa B controls expression of inhibitor I kappa B alpha : evidence for an inducible autoregulatory pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The eukaryotic transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) participates in many parts of the genetic program mediating T lymphocyte activation and growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Nuclear expression of NF-kappa B occurs after its induced dissociation from its cytoplasmic inhibitor I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Phorbol ester and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induction of nuclear NF-kappa B is associated with both the degradation of performed I kappa B alpha and the activation of I kappa B alpha gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transfection studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> the I kappa B alpha gene is specifically induced by the 65-kilodalton transactivating subunit of NF-kappa B. Association of the newly synthesized I kappa B alpha with p65 restores intracellular inhibition of NF-kappa B DNA binding activity and prolongs the survival of this labile inhibitor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Together , these results show that NF-kappa B controls the expression of I kappa B alpha by means of an inducible autoregulatory pathway .</sentence>
