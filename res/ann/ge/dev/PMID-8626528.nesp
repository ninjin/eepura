<sentence id="0">Nuclear appearance of a factor that binds the CD28 response element within the interleukin-2 enhancer correlates with interleukin-2 production .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of T lymphocytes requires the combined signaling of the T cell receptor and costimulatory molecules such as CD28 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The ability of T cells to produce interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) is a critical control point in T lymphocyte activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The IL-2 enhancer contains a functional motif named CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) that serves a role as a target for mitogenic T cell activation signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The CD28RE sequence reveals similarity to the consensus kappaB binding motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we demonstrate that CD28RE binds an inducible protein with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa called nuclear factor of mitogenic-activated T cells ( NF-MATp35 ) that is clearly different from the known NF- kappaB/Rel family members .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Induction of NF-MATp35 was shown to depend on de novo protein synthesis and was restricted to T cells that received a mitogenic combination of T cell stimuli , not necessarily including CD28 signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Nonmitogenic T cell stimulation did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> result in appearance of NF-MATp35</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals are integrated at the level of NF-MATp35 induction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Similar to its effect on IL-2 production , cyclosporin A inhibited the induction of NF-MATp35 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Taken together , these data demonstrate that the nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 shows excellent correlation with IL-2 production , which is a unique characteristic among nuclear factors implicated in the control of IL-2 gene expression .</sentence>
