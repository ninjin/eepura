<sentence id="0">The Role of TGF-==beta = = in T Cell Differentiation</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although TGF-==beta====-==reduced CD25 , IL-4 expression , and CD25 expression ( Figure 6B ) , IL-4 significantly inhibited TGF-==beta====-==mediated induction of FOXP3 in naive T cells driven toward FOXP3+ T cells , as shown by FACS analysis ( Figure 6A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3==- = = cells</scope> and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3==- = =</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In fact both populations showed similarly enhanced proliferation ( Figure 6A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore <scope type="neg" id="2">the TGF-==beta====-==mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> caused by overgrowth of a CD25==-==FOXP3+ minority</scope> , since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells ( between 0 % and 1 % ) , and <scope type="neg" id="3">the FOXP3+ cells were <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> confined to the highly divided cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-==beta====-==treated cells compare to activated T cells , which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-==beta = = and IL-4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells ( Figure 6B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In line with the previous findings , the IL-4==-==producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Since FOXP3 is known to act as a repressor of cytokine expression [ 20 ] , we therefore analyzed GATA3 and FOXP3 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-==beta = = demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations ( day 2 ) , but transiently co-express both factors ( days 4==-==8 ) , before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process ( day 10 ; Figure 6C ) , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression , <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">without</cue> interfering with TGF-==beta = = signaling</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">probably</cue> acting at the level of transcription factors , and <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">possibly</cue> by a GATA3-dependent mechanism</scope></scope> .</sentence>
