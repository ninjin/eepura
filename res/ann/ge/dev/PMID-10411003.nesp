<sentence id="0">Regulatory effects of interleukin-11 during acute lung inflammatory injury .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The role of interleukin-11 ( IL-11 ) was evaluated in the IgG immune complex model of acute lung injury in rats .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">IL-11 mRNA and protein were both up-regulated during the course of this inflammatory response .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Exogenously administered IL-11 substantially reduced , in a dose-dependent manner , the intrapulmonary accumulation of neutrophils and the lung vascular leak of albumin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of IL-11 were associated with reduced NF-kappaB activation in lung , reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluids , and diminished up-regulation of lung vascular ICAM-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It is interesting that IL-11 did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affect BAL fluid content of the CXC chemokines , macrophage inflammatory protein-2 ( MIP-2 ) and cytokine-inducible neutrophil chemoattractant ( CINC )</scope> ; the presence of IL-11 did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect these chemokines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , BAL content of C5a was reduced by IL-11 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> IL-11 is a regulatory cytokine in the lung and that , like other members of this family , <scope type="spec" id="3"> its anti-inflammatory properties <cue type="spec" id="3">appear</cue> to be linked to its suppression of NF-kappaB activation , diminished production of TNF-alpha , and reduced up-regulation of lung vascular ICAM-1</scope></scope> .</sentence>
