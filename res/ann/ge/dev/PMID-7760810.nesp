<sentence id="0">Ligand-dependent repression of the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 by the estrogen receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">High-dose estrogen administration induces anemia in mammals .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In chickens , estrogens stimulate outgrowth of bone marrow-derived erythroid progenitor cells and delay their maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This delay is associated with down-regulation of many erythroid cell-specific genes , including alpha- and beta-globin , band 3 , band 4.1 , and the erythroid cell-specific histone H5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show here that estrogens also reduce the number of erythroid progenitor cells in primary human bone marrow cultures .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To address <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> mechanisms by which estrogens suppress erythropoiesis</scope> , we have examined their effects on GATA-1 , an erythroid transcription factor that participates in the regulation of the majority of erythroid cell-specific genes and is necessary for full maturation of erythrocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of GATA-1 is strongly repressed by the estrogen receptor ( ER ) in a ligand-dependent manner and that this repression is reversible in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">ER-mediated repression of GATA-1 activity occurs on an artificial promoter containing a single GATA-binding site , as well as in the context of an intact promoter which is normally regulated by GATA-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">GATA-1 and ER bind to each other in vitro in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of DNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In coimmunoprecipitation experiments using transfected COS cells , GATA-1 and ER associate in a ligand-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Mapping experiments <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> GATA-1 and the ER form at least two contacts , which involve the finger region and the N-terminal activation domain of GATA-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">speculate</cue> that estrogens exert effects on erythropoiesis by modulating GATA-1 activity through protein-protein interaction with the ER</scope> .</sentence>
