<sentence id="0">Tissue-specific regulation of the rabbit 15-lipoxygenase gene in erythroid cells by a transcriptional silencer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The 15-lipoxygenase ( lox ) gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner , predominantly in erythroid cells but also in airway epithelial cells and eosinophils .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate in this report that the 5' flanking DNA of the 15-lox gene contains sequences which down-regulate its activity in a variety of non-erythroid cell lines but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in two erythroid cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The element has characteristics of a transcriptional ' silencer ' since it functions in both orientations .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The main activity of the silencer has been mapped to the first 900 bp of 5' flanking DNA , which contains nine binding sites for a nuclear factor present in non-erythroid cells but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in erythroid cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These binding sites have similar sequences and multiple copies of the binding sites confer tissue-specific down-regulation when attached to a minimal lox promoter fragment .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The 5' flanking DNA also contains a cluster of three binding sites for the GATA family of transcription factors .</sentence>
