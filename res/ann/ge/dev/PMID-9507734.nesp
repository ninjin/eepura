<sentence id="3">Porcine aortic endothelial cells ( PAEC ) were incubated for 1 hr 30 min or 5 hr with 10 % homologous porcine serum ( control ) or 10 % xenogeneic human serum and then perfused with total human leukocytes in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow ( 1.5 dynes/cm2 ) .</sentence>
