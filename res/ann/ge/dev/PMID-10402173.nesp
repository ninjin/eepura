<sentence id="0">Suppression of NF-kappaB activation in normal T cells by supernatant fluid from human renal cell carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T lymphocytes from patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) show reduced immune function and impaired activation of the transcription factor , NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We determined the mechanism of NF-kappaB suppression in T cells of RCC patient and determined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> supernatant fluid from RCC explants ( RCC-S ) induced the same phenotype of NF-kappaB suppression in normal T cells that is observed in patient T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The pattern of kappaB-binding activity in T cells of RCC patient was altered as compared to that seen in T cells obtained from normal volunteers .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In some patients , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> activation of RelA/NFkappaB1-binding activity was detectable</scope> , while in others kappaB-binding activity was modestly induced but the duration was reduced .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IkappaBalpha was degraded normally following stimulation in both normal controls and T cells from RCC patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RCC-S did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> alter the cytoplasmic levels of RelA and NF-kappaB1</scope> but did suppress their nuclear localization and inhibited the activation of RelA/NF-kappaB1 binding complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results show that RCC-S can induce in normal T cells the same phenotype of impaired NF-kappaB activation that is detected in T cells of RCC patient .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It also <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> that NF-kappaB suppression by RCC-S <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> contribute to the immunosuppression of host immunity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
