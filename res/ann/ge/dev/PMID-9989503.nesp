<sentence id="0">Functional association of Nmi with Stat5 and Stat1 in IL-2- and IFNgamma-mediated signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using the coiled-coil region of Stat5b as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen , we identified the association of Nmi , a protein of <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> function</scope> previously reported as an N-Myc interactor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We further show that Nmi interacts with all STATs except Stat2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We evaluated two cytokine systems , IL-2 and IFNgamma , and demonstrate that Nmi augments STAT-mediated transcription in response to these cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , Nmi <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain ; instead</scope> , Nmi enhances the association of CBP/p300 coactivator proteins with Stat1 and Stat5 , and together with CBP/p300 can augment IL-2- and IFNgamma-dependent transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , our data not only reveal that Nmi can potentiate STAT-dependent transcription , but also <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that it can augment coactivator protein recruitment to at least some members of a group of sequence-specific transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
