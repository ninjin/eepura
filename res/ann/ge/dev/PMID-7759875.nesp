<sentence id="0">Abnormal regulation of the IL-2 promoter in lpr CD4-CD8- T lymphocytes results in constitutive expression of a novel nuclear factor of activated T cells-binding factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The inert quality of MRL-Ipr/Ipr ( Ipr ) peripheral CD4-CD8- ( CD4-8- ) T cells manifests primarily as an inability to proliferate or produce IL-2 in response to TCR or mitogenic stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Yet these same cells do initiate early TCR-mediated signaling events , such as generation of inositol phosphates and increased intracellular calcium .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">They also display constitutively high levels of p59fyn and CD3 zeta tyrosine phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The generation of second messengers in T cells normally leads to downstream signaling that results in transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We , therefore , compared the activation state of the IL-2 gene promoter region in freshly isolated and stimulated Ipr CD4-8- T cells with that of normal T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Levels of the octamer , NF-kappa B ( p50-p65 heterodimer ) , and AP-1 transcriptional factors are constitutively elevated in freshly isolated Ipr CD4-8- T cells , consistent with the activated phenotype of these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Upon stimulation with mitogens , formation of the transactivating complex , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) , occurs with normal kinetics in Ipr CD4-8- T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Yet , the levels of the activating NF-AT complex never reach those observed in similarly stimulated normal T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , nuclear extracts from Ipr CD4-8- T cells display high levels of a novel specific binding activity at the NF-AT site , which is present at much lower levels in freshly isolated normal T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Upon mitogenic stimulation , the binding activity of the novel NF-AT-binding factor is rapidly down-regulated in normal T cells , but persists at high levels in Ipr CD4-8- T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These two abnormalities at the NF-AT site provide a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> mechanism to account for the defect in IL-2 production from Ipr CD4-8- T cells</scope> .</sentence>
