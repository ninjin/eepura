<sentence id="0">Triggering of HLA-DR antigens differentially modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha release by B cells at distinct stage of maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Triggering of HLA class II antigens by the anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) L243 significantly ( P < 0.05 ) and differentially enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) by the non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma cells Ri-I , Ci-I , and Sc-I , which are at a distinct stage of B-cell differentiation , and by the more mature Burkitt lymphoma cell Raji ; in contrast , it did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> induce TNF-alpha release by the pre-B leukemia cells Nalm-6 and BV173</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">TNF-alpha release peaked at 24 h and decreased thereafter , and it was dose dependent and preceded by an increase of TNF-alpha mRNA detectable after 3 h of stimulation with mAb L243 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Secreted TNF-alpha mediated the enhancement of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) binding activity ; in fact , the triggering of HLA-DR antigens in the presence of antihuman TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibodies did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> upregulate NF-kappa B and AP-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , released TNF-alpha was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> responsible for the homotypic aggregation of Ri-I , Ci-I , Sc-I , and Raji cells induced by mAb L243</scope> , and it did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> affect the proliferation of B cells investigated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Altogether , our data demonstrate that : ( a ) the ability of B cells to release TNF-alpha after triggering of HLA-DR antigens depends on their stage of differentiation ; ( b ) <scope type="spec" id="5"> levels of released TNF-alpha <cue type="spec" id="5">seem</cue> to correlate with the stage of B-cell maturation</scope> but do <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> correlate with the amounts of cell surface HLA-DR antigens</scope> ; ( c ) secreted TNF-alpha regulates the levels of expression of NF-kappa B and AP-1 by an autocrine loop ; and ( d ) intracellular signals mediating TNF-alpha release by B cells are distinct from those regulating homotypic aggregation and proliferation .</sentence>
