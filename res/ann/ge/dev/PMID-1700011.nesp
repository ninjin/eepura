<sentence id="0">NF-X2 that binds to the DRA X2-box is activator protein 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression cloning of c-Jun .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Human class II MHC Ag are a family of cell surface glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Their constitutive expression is limited to B lymphocytes and thymic epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In many other cells their expression can be induced by IFN-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Conserved upstream promoter sequences regulate this tissue-specific expression of class II genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the DRA promoter , one of these cis-acting regulatory motifs is the X2-box to which nuclear factor X2 ( NF-X2 ) binds .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Here , we present the isolation and characterization of the full-length cDNA clone encoding NF-X2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This cDNA clone was isolated by expression cDNA cloning , and encodes the human c-Jun protein , which together with c-Fos forms the heterodimeric activator protein-1 transcription complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Whereas c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> exist in B cells</scope> , they form and bind to the X2-box in class II nonexpressing cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Thus , c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> contribute to the repression of DRA gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
