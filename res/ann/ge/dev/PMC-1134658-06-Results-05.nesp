<sentence id="0">BMP-6 induces upregulation of Id1</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Next , we wanted to explore <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 also could induce transcriptional changes of target genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this regard , the inhibitors of DNA binding proteins ( Ids ) are considered to be some of the major target genes for Smad-signalling [ 17 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus , B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15 , and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The amount of Id1==-==Id4 mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells ( Figure 7 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The up-regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene , with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> significant changes were observed for Id2 and Id3 mRNA</scope> , whereas Id4-transcripts were <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> detectable ( Figure 7 <scope type="neg" id="3">, data <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> shown )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Western blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition , showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 ( p = = < / = = = 0.020 , n = 4 ) ( Figure 8 and 9 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In line with the mRNA data , <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> consistent change in the amounts of Id2 and Id3 protein could be observed</scope> ( Figure 8 and 9 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We were able to block the Id1 specific band with a blocking peptide <scope type="neg" id="5">( data <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> shown )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Taken together , these data <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that Id1 <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">could</cue> be a <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">possible</cue> target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells</scope></scope></scope> , whereas <scope type="spec" id="9"> Id2 and Id3 not <cue type="spec" id="9">seem</cue> to be involved</scope> .</sentence>
