<sentence id="0">The Epstein-Barr virus oncogene product latent membrane protein 1 engages the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein to mediate B lymphocyte growth transformation and activate NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) is essential for the transformation of B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous data are consistent with a model that LMP1 is a constitutively activated receptor that transduces signals for transformation through its carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">One transformation effector site ( TES1 ) , located within the membrane proximal 45 residues of the cytoplasmic tail , constitutively engages tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Signals from TES1 are sufficient to drive initial proliferation of infected resting B lymphocytes , but most lymphoblastoid cells infected with a virus that does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> express the 155 residues beyond TES1</scope> <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">fail</cue> to grow as long-term cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We now find that mutating two tyrosines to an isoleucine at the carboxyl end of the cytoplasmic tail cripples the ability of EBV to cause lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth , thereby marking a second transformation effector site , TES2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A yeast two-hybrid screen identified TES2 interacting proteins , including the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein ( TRADD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">TRADD was the only protein that interacted with wild-type TES2 and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> with isoleucine-mutated TES2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">TRADD associated with wild-type LMP1 but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> with isoleucine-mutated LMP1 in mammalian cells</scope> , and TRADD constitutively associated with LMP1 in EBV-transformed cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In transfection assays , TRADD and TES2 synergistically mediated high-level NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> LMP1 appropriates TRADD to enable efficient long-term lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="spec" id="5"> High-level NF-kappaB activation also <cue type="spec" id="5">appears</cue> to be a critical component of long-term outgrowth</scope> .</sentence>
