<sentence id="0">Inhibition of NF-AT signal transduction events by a dominant-negative form of calcineurin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An inhibitory , " dominant-negative , " form of the calcineurin catalytic ( A ) subunit was prepared , which <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> the calmodulin-binding domain , autoinhibitory domain and most of its catalytic core</scope> but possesses the regulatory ( B ) subunit binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">When tested for its ability to block calcineurin-dependent signaling in Jurkat cells , expression of this " B-subunit knock-out " ( BKO ) construct suppressed reporter gene activity driven by NF-AT , the pivotal promoter element for interleukin (IL)-2 gene induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Immunoprecipitation of epitope-labeled BKO demonstrated for the formation of a tight complex with endogenous B subunit in Jurkat cells , consistent with an inhibitory mechanism that involves the sequestration of the B subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , the sharply reduced NF-AT activity produced by co-transfecting BKO could be " rescued " by overexpression of transfected B subunit , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that depletion of this subunit was responsible for the inhibition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potential</cue> utility of agents that disrupt calcineurin-mediated signal transduction pathways by blocking formation of the catalytically active dimer of calcineurin A and B subunits</scope></scope> .</sentence>
