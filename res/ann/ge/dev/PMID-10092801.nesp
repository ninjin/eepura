<sentence id="0">Impaired fetal thymocyte development after efficient adenovirus-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We introduce a new experimental system combining adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This system allowed us to efficiently express in developing thymocytes a mutant form of the NF-kappa B inhibitor I kappa B alpha ( mut-I kappa B ) and to study the maturation defects occurring when NF-kappa B activation is inhibited during fetal development .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Fetal thymocytes infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B were found to develop normally until the CD44-CD25+ , CD4-CD8- double-negative stage , while production of more mature double-positive and single-positive populations was strongly decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Proliferation , as measured by the percentage of cells in cycle appeared normal , as did rearrangement and expression of the TCR beta-chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , apoptosis was much higher in FTOC infected with adenovirus containing mut-I kappa B than in FTOC infected with a control virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that NF-kappa B plays a crucial role in ensuring the differentiation and survival of thymocytes in the early stages of their development</scope> .</sentence>
