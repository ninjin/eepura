<sentence id="0">INTRODUCTION</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The recently discovered APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases is considered to play an important role in antiviral intrinsic immunity ( 1,2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In primates , the seven paralogs APOBEC3A , B , C , DE , F , G , H ( A3A-H ) have been described ( 3 ) , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> they <cue type="spec" id="0">appear</cue> to fulfill individual functions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Human APOBEC3G ( A3G ) , the most prominent member of the APOBEC3 family has been identified as the cellular restriction factor that is responsible for inhibition of virion infectivity factor (Vif)-deleted human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) replication in non-permissive cells ( 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A3G is packaged into HIV-1==Delta==vif particles and causes C-to-U deaminations on the single-stranded viral DNA during reverse transcription ( 5==-==8 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This leads to degradation of the uracile-containing DNA by cellular repair mechanisms or to hypermutation of the viral genome ( 5,6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As a result , only a marginal fraction of the A3G-containing HIV-1 particles is able to complete the replication cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition to the inhibition of HIV-1 , A3G restricts replication of other lentiviruses , gammaretroviruses , deltaretroviruses , spumaviruses , long-terminal-repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons , orthohepadnaviruses and avihepadnaviruses ( 9==-==21 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Interestingly , <scope type="spec" id="1"> deamination <cue type="spec" id="1">seems</cue> not to be the only A3G-mediated antiviral mechanism</scope> ; in the case of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) , A3G was shown to restrict virus replication by deamination-independent mechanisms ( 12 , 13 , 19 , 22==-==25 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="2"> Another member of the APOBEC3 family , APOBEC3F ( A3F ) , <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to have similar activities like A3G ( 26,27 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">A3F is also packaged into HIV-1==Delta==vif particles and induces similar C-to-U deaminations , although the proteins differ in their target sequences specificity ( 26,28 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Furthermore , A3F proteins were detected in many tissues that express A3G and are able to form heteromultimers with A3G ( 26,29,30 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Both proteins localize to mRNA processing ( P ) bodies , cytoplasmic compartments involved in the degradation and storage of non-translating mRNAs ( 30,31 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">A3G has been shown to be expressed in T cells , a relevant cell target for HIV-1 in vivo , but little is known about its regulation ( 4,29,32 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">There is a report describing that mitogenic stimulation of T cells upregulates A3G mRNA levels , but <scope type="neg" id="3">this was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> analyzed on the transcriptional level ( 33 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Since the A3G promoter has not been systematically analyzed so far , our aim was to clone the A3G promoter and characterize its regulation in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In our study , we observed that A3G uses multiple transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">By generating a series of 5 = = ' = = deletions of the A3G promoter , we identified a 180 bp region that mediated basal transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">In T cells , transcriptional activity of this core promoter was <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> inducible by mitogenic stimulation or interferon treatment</scope> , but was dependent on a GC-box which was recognized by Sp ( specificity protein ) 1 and Sp3 transcription factors .</sentence>
