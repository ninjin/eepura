<sentence id="0">Differential effects of lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor on monocytic IkappaB kinase signalsome activation and IkappaB proteolysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) are potent activators of NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This study compared the effect of these stimuli on endogenous IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) signalsome activation and IkappaB phosphorylation/proteolysis in human monocytic cells and investigated the role of the signalsome proteins IKK-alpha , IKK-beta , NF-kappaB-inducing kinase ( NIK ) , IKK-gamma ( NF-kappaB essential modulator ) , and IKK complex-associated protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Kinase assays showed that TNF elicited a rapid but short-lived induction of IKK activity with a 3-fold greater effect on IKK-alpha than on IKK-beta , peaking at 5 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , LPS predominantly stimulated IKK-beta activity , which slowly increased , peaking at 30 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A second peak was observed at a later time point following LPS stimulation , which consisted of both IKK-alpha and -beta activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The endogenous levels of the signalsome components were unaffected by stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , our studies showed association of the IKK-alpha/beta heterodimer with NIK , IkappaB-alpha and -epsilon in unstimulated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Exposure to LPS or TNF led to differential patterns of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-epsilon disappearance from and reassembly with the signalsome , whereas IKK-alpha , IKK-beta , and NIK remained complex-associated .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">NIK cannot phosphorylate IkappaB-alpha directly , but <scope type="spec" id="0"> it <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be a functionally important subunit</scope> , because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced kappaB-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-alpha or -beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Overexpression of IKK complex-associated protein inhibited stimulus-mediated transcription , whereas NF-kappaB essential modulator enhanced it .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The understanding of LPS- and TNF-induced signaling <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> allow the development of specific strategies to treat sepsis-associated disease</scope> .</sentence>
