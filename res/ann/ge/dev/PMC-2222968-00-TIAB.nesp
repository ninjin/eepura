<sentence id="0">GATA3-Driven Th2 Responses Inhibit TGF-==beta==1==-==Induced FOXP3 Expression and the Formation of Regulatory T Cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factors act in concert to induce lineage commitment towards Th1 , Th2 , or T regulatory ( Treg ) cells , and their counter-regulatory mechanisms were shown to be critical for polarization between Th1 and Th2 phenotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">FOXP3 is an essential transcription factor for natural , thymus-derived ( nTreg ) and inducible Treg ( iTreg ) commitment ; however , the mechanisms regulating its expression are as yet unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We describe a mechanism controlling iTreg polarization , which is overruled by the Th2 differentiation pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We demonstrated that interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) present at the time of T cell priming inhibits FOXP3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This inhibitory mechanism was also confirmed in Th2 cells and in T cells of transgenic mice overexpressing GATA-3 in T cells , which are shown to be deficient in transforming growth factor (TGF)-==beta====-==mediated FOXP3 induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of GATA3 to the FOXP3 promoter , which represses its transactivation process .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore , this study provides a new understanding of tolerance development , controlled by a type 2 immune response .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">IL-4 treatment in mice reduces iTreg cell frequency , highlighting that therapeutic approaches that target IL-4 or GATA3 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> provide new preventive strategies facilitating tolerance induction particularly in Th2-mediated diseases , such as allergy</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Author Summary</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Specific immune responses against foreign or autologous antigens are driven by specialized epitope-specific T cells , whose numbers expand upon recognition of antigen found on professional antigen-presenting cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The subsequent maturation process involves the differentiation of certain T cell phenotypes such as pro-inflammatory cells ( Th1 , Th2 , Th17 ) or regulatory T ( Treg ) cells , which serve to keep the immune response in check .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The current study focuses on the role of two key transcription factors==-==FOXP3 and GATA3==-==in controlling the commitment of these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">We demonstrate that the Th2 cytokine IL-4 inhibits the induction of FOXP3 and thus inhibits the generation of inducible Treg cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">We show that IL-4==-==induced GATA3 mediates FOXP3 inhibition by directly binding to a GATA element in the FOXP3 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesize</cue> that therapeutic agents aimed at neutralizing IL-4 could be a novel strategy to facilitate inducible Treg cell generation and thus promotion of tolerance in allergies and other Th2-dominated diseases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">It is shown that Th2 responses prevent the generation of inducible Tregs .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">This is mediated by IL-4 induction of GATA3 , which binds directly to and represses the FOXP3 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="18"><scope type="spec" id="2"> This mechanism is <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to be relevant in the induction of immunotolerance , particularly in allergic diseases</scope> .</sentence>
