<sentence id="0">Signaling events induced by lipopolysaccharide-activated toll-like receptor 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) is a signaling receptor that responds to LPS and activates NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we investigate further the events triggered by TLR2 in response to LPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that TLR2 associates with the high-affinity LPS binding protein membrane CD14 to serve as an LPS receptor complex , and that LPS treatment enhances the oligomerization of TLR2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Concomitant with receptor oligomerization , the IL-1R-associated kinase ( IRAK ) is recruited to the TLR2 complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Intracellular deletion variants of TLR2 lacking <scope type="spec" id="1"> C-terminal 13 <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> 141 aa</scope> <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">fail</cue> to recruit IRAK</scope> , which is consistent with the inability of these mutants to transmit LPS cellular signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , both deletion mutants could still form complexes with wild-type TLR2 and act in a dominant-negative ( DN ) fashion to block TLR2-mediated signal transduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">DN constructs of myeloid differentiation protein , IRAK , TNF receptor-associated factor 6 , and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase , when coexpressed with TLR2 , abrogate TLR2-mediated NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results reveal a conserved signaling pathway for TLR2 and IL-1Rs and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> a molecular mechanism for the inhibition of TLR2 by DN variants</scope> .</sentence>
