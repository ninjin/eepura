<sentence id="0">FOXP3 and GATA3 Kinetics in Differentiating Cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The limited capacity of differentiated effector cells to induce FOXP3 expression <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that iTreg induction has to occur before effector T cell differentiation occurs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , we analyzed the expression of FOXP3 and GATA3 during the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th0 ( neutral , anti-IL-4 , anti-IFN-==gamma = = , and anti IL-12 ) , Th2 , and iTreg phenotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">After initiation of the differentiation process , FOXP3 and GATA3 showed a similar expression kinetic within the first 3 d , which are considered to be critical in T cell commitment [ 18 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Under Th2 differentiation conditions , FOXP3 mRNA expression increased only marginally ( Figure 4A , left panel ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , although GATA3 and FOXP3 showed similar kinetics , their expression polarizes at the end of the differentiation process when cells were cultured towards Th2 or iTreg cells , respectively ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , the Th0 cells were expressing more FOXP3 than the Th2 cells , but expressed low levels of GATA3 ; however , the protein expression slightly differed from mRNA expression , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> also posttranslational regulation and degradation as <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potential</cue> additional mechanisms in the differentiation process</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The phenotype of iTreg cells included an anergic phenotype upon anti-CD3 re-stimulation ( Figure S1A ) , CD103 , CTLA-4 , GITR , and PD-1 surface expression ( Figure S1B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">On the single-cell level , it can be seen that cells progress through a transition phase , where GATA3 and FOXP3 expression coexist to some degree in the same cells , which is resolved in iTreg cells after 7 d ( Figure 4B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , these data demonstrated that Th2 cells have lost their capacity to express FOXP3 and showed that Th2 and iTreg cells arise from two different differentiation pathways .</sentence>
