<sentence id="1">Exploration at the level of induction of DNA-binding proteins and characterization of the inhibitory activity of cyclosporine .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have demonstrated earlier that the crosslinkage of the CD3/TCR complex with the CD2 antigen results in the proliferation of normal human T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The effect of this synergism was perceptible at the level of induction of the IL-2 gene , a process critical for T cell growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To further understand the molecular and nuclear basis for this synergism , we have explored the induction of DNA-binding proteins in highly purified normal human T cells signaled via the CD3 and/or CD2 proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The effect of transmembrane signaling of T cells with ionomycin , and/or sn-1,2 dioctanoyl glycerol , was also determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The emergence of nuclear binding proteins was investigated using interleukin-2 sequence specific oligonucleotide probes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our studies demonstrate for the first time that CD3 antigen-derived signals and CD2 antigen-derived signals are synergistic in inducing the emergence of transcription factors that bind to the NF-AT1 , AP-1 , and NF-kB sites located in the promoter/enhancer region of the IL-2 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , cyclosporine , at concentrations readily accomplished in clinical practice , was found to inhibit the emergence of these DNA-binding proteins in normal human T cells signaled via cell surface proteins implicated in antigen-dependent T cell activation and in T cells stimulated by mobilization of cellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C .</sentence>
