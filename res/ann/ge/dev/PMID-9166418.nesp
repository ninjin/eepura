<sentence id="0">An isotype-specific activator of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes that is independent of class II transactivator .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Patients with one type of major histocompatibility complex class II combined immunodeficiency have mutations in a gene termed class II transactivator ( CIITA ) , which coordinately controls the transcription of the three major human class II genes , HLA-DR , -DQ , and -DP .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the experimentally derived B-lymphoblastoid cell line , clone 13 , expresses high levels of HLADQ in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of HLA-DR and HLA-DP</scope> , despite its mapping by complementation analysis to this group .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It was <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> that one of the clone 13 CIITA alleles bore a mutation that allowed HLA-DQ , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> HLA-DR or -DP transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Alternatively , another factor , distinct from CIITA , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> control HLA-DQ expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We report here that ectopic expression of CIITA cDNAs derived by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from clone 13 do <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> restore expression of HLA-DQ in another CIITA-deficient cell line , RJ2.2.5</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> CIITA protein is detectable in clone 13 nuclear extracts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , somatic cell fusion between clone 13 and RJ2.2.5 restored expression of the HLA-DQ haplotype encoded by the RJ2.2.5 DQB gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , these data demonstrate the existence of an HLA-DQ isotype-specific trans-acting factor , which functions independently of CIITA .</sentence>
