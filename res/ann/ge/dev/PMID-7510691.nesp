<sentence id="0">The interleukin-8 AP-1 and kappa B-like sites are genetic end targets of FK506-sensitive pathway accompanied by calcium mobilization .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">FK506 , an immunosuppressant , inhibits the production of several cytokines in T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We observed that FK506 suppressed the transcription of a chemotactic cytokine , interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) in a human T cell line , Jurkat cells , activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ( Ca2+ ) ionophore ( ionomycin ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By deleted and mutated analysis of the IL-8 promoters , the AP-1 and kappa B-like sites were identified as the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the AP-1 or kappa B-like sites induced by PMA plus Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> those induced by Ca(2+)-independent stimuli</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In gel retardation analysis , FK506 had little effect on the binding to the AP-1 site of PMA/ionomycin-induced nuclear factors , which were recognized with anti-JunD or c-Fos antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , FK506 or EGTA ( Ca2+ chelator ) similarly affected the formation of kappa B-like site binding complexes , <scope type="neg" id="1">which were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> recognized by any antibodies against the human Rel family proteins ( c-Rel , p65 , p50 , and p49 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , we confirmed the previous report that FK506 suppressed the PMA/ionomycin-induced activation through authentic kappa B site of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gene , to which NF-kappa B binding was also decreased by FK506 , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> both IL-8 kappa B-like site and Ig kappa B site are FK506-sensitive in spite of the difference of binding factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> not only the reported IL-2 NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites and Ig kappa B site , but also the IL-8 AP-1 and kappa B-like sites are terminals of FK506-sensitive pathway involving Ca2+ mobilization</scope> .</sentence>
