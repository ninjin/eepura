<sentence id="0">Activation of the Janus kinase 3-STAT5a pathway after CD40 triggering of human monocytes but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> of resting B cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD40/CD40 ligand interactions play a key role in the immune responses of B lymphocytes , monocytes , and dendritic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The signal transduction events triggered by cross-linking of the CD40 receptor have been widely studied in B cell lines , but little is known about signaling following CD40 stimulation of monocytes and resting tonsillar B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Therefore , we studied the CD40 pathway in highly purified human monocytes and resting B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After CD40 triggering , a similar activation of the NF-kappaB ( but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> of the AP-1 )</scope> transcription factor complex occurred in both cell preparations .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the components of the NF-kappaB complexes were different in monocytes and B cells , because p50 is part of the NF-kappaB complex induced by CD40 triggering in both monocytes and B cells , whereas p65 was only induced in B cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , although the Janus kinase 3 tyrosine kinase was associated with CD40 molecules in both monocytes and resting B cells , Janus kinase 3 phosphorylation induction was observed only in CD40-activated monocytes , with subsequent induction of STAT5a DNA binding activity in the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the activation signals in human B cells and monocytes differ following CD40 stimulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This observation is consistent with the detection of normal CD40-induced monocyte activation in patients with CD40 ligand+ hyper IgM syndrome in whom a defect in CD40-induced B cell activation has been reported .</sentence>
