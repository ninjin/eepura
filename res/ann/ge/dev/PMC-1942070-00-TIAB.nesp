<sentence id="0">Protein kinase D enzymes are dispensable for proliferation , survival and antigen receptor-regulated NF==kappa==B activity in vertebrate B-cells</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Abstract</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the importance of protein kinase D ( PKD ) enzymes we generated a PKD-null DT40 B-lymphocyte cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Previously we have shown that PKDs have an essential role in regulating class II histone deacetylases in DT40 B-cells [ Matthews , S.A. , Liu , P. , Spitaler , M. , Olson , E.N. , McKinsey , T.A. , Cantrell , D.A. and Scharenberg , A.M. ( 2006 ) Essential role for protein kinase D family kinases in the regulation of class II histone deacetylases in B lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mol .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Cell Biol. 26 , 1569==-==1577 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We now show that PKDs are also required to regulate HSP27 phosphorylation in DT40 B-cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , in contrast to previous observations in other cell types , PKD enzymes do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> regulate basic cellular processes such as proliferation or survival responses</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">nor</cue> NF==kappa==B</scope> transcriptional activity downstream of the B cell antigen receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , PKDs have a selective role in DT40 B-cell biology .</sentence>
