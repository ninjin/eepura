<sentence id="0">Differential regulation of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 , two repressors of translation initiation , during human myeloid cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human myeloid differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because the translation rate is an important determinant of cell proliferation , we have investigated translation initiation during human myeloid cell differentiation using the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line and the U-937 monoblastic cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A decrease in the translation rate is observed when the cells are induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The inhibition in protein synthesis correlates with specific regulation of two repressors of translation initiation , 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Induction of HL-60 and U-937 cell differentiation into monocytes/macrophages by IFN-gamma or PMA results in a dephosphorylation and consequent activation of 4E-BP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was also observed when U-937 cells were induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages following treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid or DMSO , which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells , decreases 4E-BP1 amount <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> affecting its phosphorylation</scope> and strongly increases 4E-BP2 amount .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , these data provide evidence for differential regulation of the translational machinery during human myeloid differentiation , specific to the monocytic/macrophage pathway or to the granulocytic pathway .</sentence>
