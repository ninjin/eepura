<sentence id="0">Membrane-associated lymphotoxin on natural killer cells activates endothelial cells via an NF-kappaB-dependent pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Inhibition of complement in small animal models of xenotransplantation has demonstrated graft infiltration with natural killer ( NK ) cells and monocytes associated with endothelial cell ( EC ) activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have previously demonstrated that human NK cells activate porcine EC in vitro , which results in adhesion molecule expression and cytokine secretion .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we used the NK cell line NK92 to define the molecular and cellular basis of NK cell-mediated EC activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHODS : EC were transfected with either reporter constructs containing the luciferase gene driven either by E-selectin or interleukin (IL)-8 promoters or a synthetic NF-kappaB-dependent promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , a dominant-negative mutant tumor necrosis factor receptor I ( TNFRI ) expression vector was co-transfected in inhibition studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Forty-eight hours after transfection , EC were stimulated with NK cells or NK cell membrane extracts for 7 hr and activation was measured by a luciferase assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RESULTS : Co-culture of NK cells with transfected EC enhanced E-selectin , IL-8 , and NF-kappaB-dependent promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">NK cell membrane extracts retained the capacity to activate EC and induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB ( p50 and p65 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Western blotting of NK cell and membrane extracts detected the presence of Lymphotoxin-alpha ( LTalpha ) but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> tumor necrosis factor-alpha</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , LTalpha was secreted in NK:EC co-cultures .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Co-transfection with dominant-negative mutant TNFRI inhibited EC activation by NK cell membrane extracts and by NK cells by 80 % and 47 % , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The same pattern of inhibition was observed using anti-human LT sera .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSIONS : Human NK cell membrane-bound LT signals across species via TNFRI , leading to NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and transcription of E-selectin and IL-8 , which results in EC activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">The discrepancy in the degree of inhibition by membrane extracts and NK cells with mutant TNFRI <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that additional pathways are utilized by NK cells to activate EC</scope> .</sentence>
