<sentence id="0">IL-7 reconstitutes multiple aspects of v-Abl-mediated signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The mechanism by which early lymphoid cells are selectively transformed by v-Abl is currently <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling pathways , as measured by activation of Janus protein kinase (JAK)1 , JAK3 , STAT5 , and STAT6 , in pre-B cells transformed by v-Abl .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> activation of these cytokine signaling pathways by v-Abl is important in the cellular events induced by the Abelson murine leukemia virus</scope> , the effects of IL-4 and IL-7 on pre-B cells transformed with a temperature-sensitive v-Abl mutant were examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Whereas IL-4 had little or <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect</scope> , IL-7 delayed both the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that occur upon v-Abl kinase inactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IL-7 also delayed the decreases in the levels of c-Myc , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-xL that occur upon loss of v-Abl kinase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">IL-7 did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> maintain v-Abl-mediated differentiation arrest of the pre-B cells</scope> , as activation of NF-kappaB and RAG gene transcription was unaffected by IL-7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results identify a <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">potential</cue> role for IL-7 signaling pathways in transformation by v-Abl</scope> while demonstrating that a combination of IL-4 and IL-7 signaling cannot substitute for an active v-Abl kinase in transformed pre-B cells .</sentence>
