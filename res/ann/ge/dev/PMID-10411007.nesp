<sentence id="0">ETS transcription factors regulate an enhancer activity in the third intron of TNF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We describe an enhancer site in the third intron of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A reporter construct containing the 5'-flanking region of the mouse TNF-alpha gene displayed weak activity when transfected into RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The addition of the third intron of TNF-alpha to this construct resulted in an enhancement of CAT protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This enhancement was eliminated if a conserved 20-bp sequence was removed from the intron or if a dominant-negative ets-binding factor was co-transfected with the reporter gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutations of this site that destroyed <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> ets transcription factor binding sites</scope> had reduced transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The major transcription factor that bound to the oligonucleotide was confirmed to be GABP by supershift and competition analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In RAW264.7 cells , the binding was constitutive , however , in bone marrow-derived macrophages binding activity was shown to be interferon-gamma inducible .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">imply</cue> a role for ets transcription factors in the production of TNF-alpha</scope></scope> .</sentence>
