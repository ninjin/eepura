<sentence id="0">Induction of Sp1 phosphorylation and NF-kappa B-independent HIV promoter domain activity in T lymphocytes stimulated by okadaic acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In contrast to the purely enhancer-dependent effect of cytokines such as TNF on the activity of the HIV regulatory region ( LTR ) , we observed that okadaic acid ( OKA ) activates HIV transcription through both the enhancer , responding to the factor NF-kappa B , and the promoter domain of the LTR .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The inducibility of HIV LTR-driven luciferase expression constructs in lymphoblastoid cells stimulated by OKA depended on both functional Sp1 binding elements and the ability of the TATA box to bind the protein TBP .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In both transformed and normal lymphocytes , OKA stimulation induced intense phosphorylation of the constitutively expressed Sp1 protein in the nucleus , a property of OKA <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> shared by TNF , phorbol ester , or PHA and interleukin 2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Responsiveness of LTR constructs deleted of kappa B elements to HIV Tat expression was increased upon OKA but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> TNF stimulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that SP1 phosphorylation induced by OKA , a selective inhibitor of the serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A , facilitates the formation of a transcription complex involving general transcription factors , HIV Tat , and Sp1 proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The formation of this complex would increase , independently of an in synergy with NF-kappa B , the low basal activity of the HIV LTR observed in normal T lymphocytes .</sentence>
