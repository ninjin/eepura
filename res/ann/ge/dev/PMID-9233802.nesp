<sentence id="0">c-Myb and Ets proteins synergize to overcome transcriptional repression by ZEB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Zfh family of zinc finger/homeodomain proteins was first identified in Drosophila where it is required for differentiation of tissues such as the central nervous system and muscle .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">ZEB , a vertebrate homolog of Zfh-1 , binds a subset of E boxes and blocks myogenesis through transcriptional repression of muscle genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We present evidence here that ZEB also has an important role in controlling hematopoietic gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Two families of transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis are c-Myb and Ets. These factors act synergistically to activate transcription , and this synergy is required for transcription of at least several important hematopoietic genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">ZEB blocks the activity of c-Myb and Ets individually , but together the factors synergize to resist this repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Such repression imposes a requirement for both c-Myb and Ets for transcriptional activity , providing one explanation for why synergy between these factors is important .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The balance between repression by ZEB and transcriptional activation by c-Myb/Ets provides a flexible regulatory mechanism for controlling gene expression in hematopoietic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We demonstrate that one target of this positive/negative regulation in vivo is the alpha4 integrin , which play a key role in normal hematopoiesis and function of mature leukocytes .</sentence>
