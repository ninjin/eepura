<sentence id="0">Interferons induce normal and aberrant retinoic-acid receptors type alpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells : potentiation of the induction of retinoid-dependent differentiation markers .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Treatment of the acute promyelocytic ( APL ) cell line NB4 with interferon alpha ( IFN(alpha) ) , as well as IFN(beta) and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic-acid receptor type alpha ( RAR(alpha) ) and the leukemia-specific retinoic acid receptor PML-RAR .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transcriptional induction of the RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR mRNAs is rapid and it is parallelled by an increase in the corresponding proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Up-regulation of RAR(alpha) and PML-RAR gene expression by IFN(alpha) is accompanied by a strong potentiation in the induction of 2 retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers , i.e. , granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor mRNA and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , IFN(alpha) does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> have any effects on the retinoid-dependent regulation of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The IFN-dependent increase in RAR(alpha) levels and the enhancing effect of the cytokine on retinoid-dependent granulocytic markers expression <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be a characteristic of PML-RAR positive cells</scope> , since <scope type="neg" id="1">the phenomena are <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> observed in HL-60 promyelocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interferons as well as retinoids inhibit the growth of NB4 cells , although the 2 classes of compounds do not significantly interact in terms of anti-proliferative activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> use of combinations between IFNs and retinoic acid in the cyto-differentiating treatment of APL patients</scope></scope> .</sentence>
