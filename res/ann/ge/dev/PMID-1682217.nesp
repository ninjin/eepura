<sentence id="0">v-erbA overexpression is required to extinguish c-erbA function in erythroid cell differentiation and regulation of the erbA target gene CAII .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The v-erbA oncoprotein represents a retrovirus-transduced oncogenic version of the thyroid hormone ( T3/T4 ) receptor c-erbA ( type alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It contributes to virus-induced erythroleukemia by efficiently arresting differentiation of red cell progenitors and by suppressing transcription of erythrocyte-specific genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that v-erbA and c-erbA bind directly to sequences within the promoter of the erythrocyte-specific carbonic anhydrase II ( CAII ) , a gene whose transcription is efficiently suppressed by v-erbA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This erbA-binding site confers thyroid hormone responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in transient expression experiments and is a target for efficient down-regulation of CAII transcription by the v-erbA oncoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In stably transformed erythroblasts coexpressing the v-erbA oncoprotein and the c-erbA/T3 receptor at an approximately equimolar ratio , c-erbA activity is dominant over v-erbA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">T3 efficiently induced erythroid differentiation in these cells , thus overcoming the v-erbA-mediated differentiation arrest .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Likewise , T3 activated CAII transcription as well as transient expression of a T3-responsive reporter gene containing the CAII-specific erbA-binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The c-erbA-dependent activation of this CAII reporter construct <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> only be suppressed by very high amounts of v-erbA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that overexpression of v-erbA is required for its function as an oncoprotein</scope> .</sentence>
