<sentence id="0">Modulation of endogenous IL-1 beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist results in opposing effects on HIV expression in chronically infected monocytic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A proportion of HIV-infected individuals experience episodes of localized or systemic bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Many of the clinical side effects of these infections are associated with the production of proinflammatory cytokines , which are induced primarily by LPS , a constituent of the bacterial cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The present study examines the mechanisms involved in LPS-mediated induction of HIV expression in U1 cells , a promonocytic cell line chronically infected with HIV .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Stimulation of U1 cells by LPS alone induced minimal levels of HIV expression , which was significantly enhanced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Costimulation of U1 cells with LPS plus GM-CSF resulted in the accumulation of steady-state levels of HIV RNA ; however , only a weak induction of HIV long terminal repeat-driven transcription , <scope type="neg" id="0">which was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> associated with the activation of the cellular transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B</scope> , was noted .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Costimulation of cells with LPS plus GM-CSF induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines , IL-8 , IL-1 beta and IL-6 , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> TNF-alpha</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">IL-1 receptor antagonist ( ra ) inhibited LPS enhancement of HIV expression in GM-CSF-stimulated cells , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that endogenous IL-1 was involved in LPS-mediated viral production</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In this regard , anti-inflammatory cytokines inhibited LPS plus GM-CSF-stimulated HIV expression , and this effect closely correlated with inhibition of IL-1 beta release and , in particular , with up-regulation of endogenous IL-1ra production .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , the balance between an endogenously produced viral inducer ( IL-1 beta ) and an inhibitor ( IL-1ra ) <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> represent an important pathway leading to modulation of HIV expression from monocytic cells</scope> .</sentence>
