<sentence id="1">Potential role of a downstream intronic sequence for elk-1 gene expression in monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To characterize the human elk-1 promoter , we mapped the transcriptional start site and isolated elk-1-specific genomic phage clones that contained extensive upstream and downstream sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A TATA-like motif was identified immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Functional analyses of DNA fragments containing the TATA element and the identification of a DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin site ( HS 1 ) in close proximity to the TATA box <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the identified TATA motif is important for elk-1 transcription in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sequences upstream and downstream from the TATA box were found to contribute to elk-1 promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A second hypersensitive site ( HS 2 ) was identified within the first intron in pre-monocytic cells , which express Elk-1 only when differentiating to monocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In a variety of other cell types , which display a constitutive Elk-1 expression , HS 2 did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> exist</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that inducibility of elk-1 expression is associated with the presence of HS 2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Egr-1 and the serum response factor were found to interact specifically with the intronic sequence at +265 and +448 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Because Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels were observed to increase significantly before induction of elk-1 expression , we <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">propose</cue> that Egr-1 is important for the regulation of elk-1 transcription in differentiating monocytes</scope> .</sentence>
