<sentence id="0">The class II trans-activator CIITA interacts with the TBP-associated factor TAFII32 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The class II trans- activator ( CIITA ) is the main transcriptional co-activator for the expression of MHC class II proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Its N-terminal 125 amino acids function as an independent transcriptional activation domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analyses of the primary amino acid sequence of the activation domain predict the presence of three alpha-helices , each with a high proportion of acidic residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using site-directed mutagenesis , we found that two of these predicted alpha-helices are required for full transcriptional activation by CIITA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , a CIITA protein in which both functional alpha-helices have been deleted displays a dominant negative phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This activation domain of CIITA interacts with the 32 kDa subunit of the general transcription complex TFIID , TAFII32 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Decreased transcriptional activation by N-terminal deletions of CIITA is correlated directly with their reduced binding to TAFII32 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that interactions between TAFII32 and CIITA are responsible for activation of class II genes .</sentence>
