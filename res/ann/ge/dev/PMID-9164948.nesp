<sentence id="0">Sequential development of structural and functional alterations in T cells from tumor-bearing mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The TCR alpha beta or -gamma delta chains bind the peptide ligand , whereas the associated CD3 deltaepsilongamma and TCR zeta subunits couple the TCR to intracellular signal transduction components .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recently , several groups have described marked alterations in signal transduction elements in T cells from cancer patients or in mice bearing tumor for a few weeks ( > 26 days ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The sequence in which these alterations develop is <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The aim of this study was to explore the kinetics of the development of alterations in signal transduction molecules ( TCR zeta chain , NF kappaB family proteins , and tyrosine kinase p56(lck) ) in mice bearing MC38 colon adenocarcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results demonstrate that alterations in NF kappaB family proteins , specifically the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">failure</cue> of p65 translocation to the nucleus</scope> , occur earlier and more frequently than the decrease in zeta-chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These defects are paralleled by an impaired ability to produce Th1 cytokines ( IL-2 and IFN-gamma ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These initial changes are followed by the eventual loss of TCR zeta chain and p56(lck) and a marked decrease in cytotoxic function .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">An increased rate of lysosomal degradation is one of the mechanisms responsible for the loss of zeta-chain .</sentence>
