<sentence id="0">An IL-2 response element in the human IL-2 receptor alpha chain promoter is a composite element that binds Stat5 , Elf-1 , HMG-I(Y) and a GATA family protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression of the human interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor alpha chain gene is potently upregulated by its own ligand , IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we characterize an essential upstream IL-2 response element that contains both consensus and non-consensus GAS motifs , two <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> Ets binding sites ( EBS )</scope> , one of which overlaps the consensus GAS motif , and a GATA motif , which overlaps the non-consensus GAS motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate that although the individual components of this element do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> respond to IL-2</scope> , together they form a composite element capable of conferring IL-2 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Multiple factors including Stat5 , Elf-1 , HMG-I(Y) and GATA family proteins bind to the IL-2 response element and mutation of any one of these binding sites diminishes the activity of this element .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">An unidentified Ets family protein binds to the EBS overlapping the consensus GAS motif and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to negatively regulate the human IL-2R alpha promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , IL-2-induced IL-2R alpha promoter activity requires a complex upstream element , <scope type="spec" id="3"> which <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to contain binding sites for both positive and negative regulatory factors</scope> .</sentence>
