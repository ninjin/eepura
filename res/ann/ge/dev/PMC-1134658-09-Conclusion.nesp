<sentence id="0">Conclusion</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In conclusion , our results show that BMP-6 induces activation of intracellular Smad signalling in mature human B-cells with consecutive production of Id1 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Furthermore , we report that BMP-6 has an antiproliferative effect in B cells stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Additionally , BMP-6 induces cell death in activated memory B cells and Ramos cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Taken together , these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of BMP-6 signalling in normal B cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like B cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders .</sentence>
