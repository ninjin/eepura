<sentence id="0">Regulation of interleukin-1beta transcription by Epstein-Barr virus involves a number of latent proteins via their interaction with RBP .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infects B cells , resulting in the outgrowth of immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we demonstrate through the use of intracellular staining that interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) is expressed in LCLs and investigate the influence of the individual latent proteins on the expression of IL-1beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using RT-PCR , IL-1beta was shown to be up-regulated in EBV-transformed LCLs as well as in group III Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) cell lines , compared with group I BL cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The up-regulation of IL-1beta message could be mediated by the latent membrane protein-1 , EBV nuclear proteins 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) demonstrated that the -300 region of the IL-1beta promoter , which contains a nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) binding site , contained a functional RBP binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Binding of RBP to this site could be inhibited by addition of EBV nuclear proteins 3 and 6 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that these proteins displace RBP from its recognition sequence , removing transcriptional repression and allowing gene transcription to occur</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In group I BL cells , containing low levels of NF-kappaB , only RBP binding was observed in EMSAs , whereas NF-kappaB binding could be demonstrated in EBV-transformed B cell lines containing high levels of activated NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , the expression of latent membrane protein-1 led to activation of NF-kappaB that was capable of binding the IL-1beta promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The study demonstrates that EBV can up-regulate IL-1beta expression , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> by using <scope type="spec" id="2"> RBP , NF-kappaB , <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> both</scope></scope> .</sentence>
