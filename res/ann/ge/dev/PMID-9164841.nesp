<sentence id="0">Involvement of the N-terminal region of the human mineralocorticoid receptor hormone-binding domain in agonist and antagonist binding as revealed by a new monoclonal antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of binding to the human mineralocorticoid receptor ( hMR ) , we developed a new monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) raised against the hormone-binding domain ( HBD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">For this purpose , mice were immunized with a fusion protein including the sequence Thr729-Lys984 of hMR .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">After ELISA screening , mAb 18C7 was selected for its specificity towards the HBD .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This antibody recognized both the denatured and native MR forms , as well as the hetero-oligomeric MR form and the transformed MR state .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By using several HBD subfragments , the mAb 18C7 epitope was located in the N-terminal region of the HBD from Thr729 to Leu765 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We then studied the effect of the antibody on aldosterone and progesterone binding to the hMR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">When 18C7 was incubated with liganded MR , it was able to partly displace ( 20 % ) the hormone from its binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">When 18C7 was incubated with MR before aldosterone or progesterone , the antibody inhibited 75-80 % of the binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The effect of 18C7 on the binding was similar with both hormones .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">A sucrose gradient analysis indicated the simultaneous presence of two kinds of receptor complexes : the steroid-MR complex and the antibody-MR complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">After its associated proteins , especially the heat-shock protein hsp90 , had been cross-linked with the hMR by dimethylpimelimidate , 18C7 was still able to react with the receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> the epitope recognized by 18C7 was directly implicated in hormone binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of steroid binding of HBD mutants with the Thr729-Leu765 sequence deleted</scope> [ Jalaguier , Mesnier , Leger and Auzou ( 1996 ) J.Steroid Biochem.Mol.Biol.57 , 43-50 ] supports this hypothesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Because of the similar behaviours of aldosterone and progesterone , we conclude that the N-terminal Thr729-Leu765 region of the HBD is similarly involved in the binding of both hormones .</sentence>
