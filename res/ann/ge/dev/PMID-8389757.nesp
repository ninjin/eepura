<sentence id="0">Defective translocation of protein kinase C in multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells confers a reversible loss of phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previous studies have demonstrated that human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells differentiate in response to phorbol esters .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This event is associated with induction of the c-jun early response gene and appearance of a monocytic phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The present studies have examined the effects of vincristine-selected , multidrug resistance on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced HL-60 cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The results demonstrate that multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells , designated HL-60/vinc , fail to respond to TPA with an increase in c-jun transcripts or other phenotypic characteristics of monocytic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By contrast , treatment of HL-60/vinc cells with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases , induces c-jun transcription , growth arrest , and expression of the c-fms gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Studies were also performed with an HL-60/vinc revertant ( HL-60/vinc/R ) line that has regained partial sensitivity to vincristine .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The finding that HL-60/vinc/R cells respond to TPA with induction of a monocytic phenotype , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> c-jun expression</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that c-jun induction is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> obligatory for monocytic differentiation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Other studies further demonstrate that the jun-B and fra-1 genes are induced by TPA in both HL-60/vinc and HL-60/vinc/R cells , whereas c-fos expression is attenuated in the HL-60/vinc line .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Since TPA activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) , we examined translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Although HL-60 and HL-60/vinc/R cells demonstrated translocation of PKC activity , this subcellular redistribution was undetectable in HL-60/vinc cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family with associated phosphorylation of c-Jun Y-peptide was markedly diminished in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> in response to okadaic acid</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Taken together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that vincristine resistance confers insensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">can</cue> include defects in PKC-mediated signaling events and induction of jun/fos early response gene expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
