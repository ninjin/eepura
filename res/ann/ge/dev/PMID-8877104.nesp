<sentence id="0">Vitamin D3- and retinoic acid-induced monocytic differentiation : interactions between the endogenous vitamin D3 receptor , retinoic acid receptors , and retinoid X receptors in U-937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Retinoic acid ( RA ) and 1,25 alpha-dihydroxycholecalciferol ( VitD3 ) are potent regulators of hematopoletic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Yet , little is known as to how the RA and VitD3 receptor network operates in hematopoietic cells , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> receptor interactions can explain the interplay between the RA- and VitD3-signaling pathways during differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Therefore , we analyzed the expression , DNA binding , and transcriptional activity of the endogenous RA and VitD3 receptors [ retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) , retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) , and VitD3 receptor ( VDR ) ] in the U-937 cell line , in which RA and VitD3 induce distinct monocytic differentiation pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">VitD3 induction resulted in the formation of VDR/RXR DNA-binding complexes on both VitD3 response elements and RA response elements ( RAREs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , transcriptional activation was only observed from a VitD3 response element-driven reporter construct .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Several DNA-binding complexes were detected on RAREs in undifferentiated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Stimulation by RA resulted in increased RAR beta/RXR DNA binding , activated RARE-dependent transcription , and increased expression of RAR-beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Concomitant stimulation by VitD3 inhibited the RA-stimulated formation of RAR beta/RXR heterodimers , favoring VDR/RXR binding to the RARE .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Also , VitD3 inhibited the expression of CD23 and CD49f , characteristic markers of retinoid-induced U-937 cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">neither</cue> the RA-stimulated , RARE-mediated transcription <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">nor</cue> the induced RAR-beta expression was suppressed by VitD3</scope></scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that VitD3 selectively inhibited the retinoid-induced differentiation program but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> the RARE-mediated signal</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These results demonstrate a complex role for VitD3 in modifying the retinoid differentiation pathway and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> have implications for differentiation-inducing therapy of hematopoietic tumors</scope> .</sentence>
