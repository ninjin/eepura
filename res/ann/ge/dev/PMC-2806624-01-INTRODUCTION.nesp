<sentence id="0">INTRODUCTION</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulatory T ( T reg ) cells expressing the transcription factor forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 , human ; Foxp3 , mouse ) play an essential role in controlling immune responses to autoantigens , allergens , tumor antigens , transplantation antigens , and infectious agents ( Hori et al. , 2003 ; Akdis , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Foxp3 is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators , and its expression in T reg cells is essential for their development and function ( Fontenot et al. , 2003 ; Williams and Rudensky , 2007 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A spontaneous mutation of the X-linked Foxp3 gene in scurfy mice causes an autoimmune-like disease , whereas the mutation in humans leads to immunodysregulation , polyendocrinopathy , enteropathy , and X-linked syndrome that is also a severe multiorgan autoimmune disease with hyper-IgE ( Ziegler , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although the essential role of Foxp3 in central and peripheral tolerance has been extensively studied , <scope type="neg" id="0">its regulation , cooperation with other transcription factors , and how it functions in <scope type="spec" id="1"> inducible T reg ( iT reg ) cells to suppress various target genes is mostly <cue type="neg" id="0"><cue type="spec" id="1">not</cue></cue> yet understood</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It is known that Foxp3 cooperates with the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) or nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-==kappa==B ) to regulate the transcription of different target genes ( Schubert et al. , 2001 ; Bettelli et al. , 2005 ; Wu et al. , 2006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The Th2 cytokine IL-4 inhibits FOXP3 expression during T cell priming .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">GATA3 binds to the FOXP3 promoter and can repress the FOXP3 trans-activation process directly in Th2 cells ( Mantel et al. , 2007 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It was further demonstrated that both Th1 and Th2 transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 oppose peripheral induction of Foxp3+ T reg cells in mice through STAT1- , STAT4- , and STAT6-dependent pathways ( Wei et al. , 2007 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Although natural T reg ( nT reg ) cells that differentiate in the thymus are characterized by their stable Foxp3 expression , the generation of iT reg cells specific for allergens , alloantigens , and autoantigens in the periphery has been associated with a transient Foxp3+ phenotype ( Fontenot et al. , 2003 ; Hori et al. , 2003 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The crucial role of TGF-==beta = = in their generation has been demonstrated .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The RUNX gene family ( Runt-related transcription factor , acute myeloid leukemia [ AML ] , core-binding factor-==alpha = = [ CBF==alpha = = ] , and polyoma enhancer-binding protein-2==alpha = = [ PEBP2==alpha = = ] ) contains three members , RUNX1 ( AML1/CBFA2/PEBP2==alpha==B ) , RUNX2 ( AML3/CBFA1 / PEBP2==alpha==A ) , and RUNX3 ( AML2/CBFA3/PEBP2==alpha==C ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">They are essential transcriptional regulators of different developmental pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">RUNX2 is mostly important for bone development and osteoblast differentiation ( Komori et al. , 1997 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">RUNX1 plays an important role in hematopoiesis during development , and RUNX3 has important functions in thymogenesis and neurogenesis ( Wang et al. , 1996 ; Inoue et al. , 2002 ; Levanon et al. , 2002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">RUNX1 and RUNX3 also work together in the establishment of lineage specification of T lymphocytes ( Taniuchi et al. , 2002 ; Egawa et al. , 2007 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">RUNX1 is a frequent target for chromosomal translocations associated with leukemias ( Look , 1997 ) , and RUNX3 methylation and silencing is observed in various human epithelial cancers ( Blyth et al. , 2005 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">RUNX family members share the Runt domain , which is responsible for DNA binding ( Ito , 1999 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">The Runt domain-containing protein constitutes the = = alpha==-chain partner of the heterodimeric CBF complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">RUNX proteins heterodimerize with the non==-==DNA-binding partner , CBF==beta = = , which increases the affinity for DNA binding and stabilizes the complex by preventing ubiquitin-dependent degradation ( Wang et al. , 1993 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="20">The CBF complexes regulate the expression of cellular genes through binding to promoters or enhancer elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="21">The effects of the RUNX==-==CBF==beta = = complex regulation are clearly cell lineage and stage specific .</sentence>
<sentence id="22">They include the crucial choices between cell-cycle exit and continued proliferation , as well as between cell differentiation and self-renewal ( Blyth et al. , 2005 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="23">Because of the involvement of RUNX mutations in different autoimmune diseases and the known interaction with TGF-==beta = = , we investigated the impact of RUNX1 and RUNX3 on the expression of FOXP3 and subsequently on the development and function of iT reg cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="24">This study demonstrates that RUNX1 and RUNX3 induced by TGF-==beta = = are involved in the development and suppressive function of Foxp3+ iT reg cells .</sentence>
