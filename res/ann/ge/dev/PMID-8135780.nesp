<sentence id="0">Calcineurin activates transcription from the GM-CSF promoter in synergy with either protein kinase C or NF-kappa B/AP-1 in T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Two cis-acting elements GM-kappa B/GC-box and CLE0 , of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene are required for maximal induction in Jurkat T cells by costimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate ( PMA ) and Ca2+ ionophore ( A23187 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The GM-kappa B sequence is recognized by NF-kappa B , which is mainly induced by PMA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The CLE0 sequence interacts with factors , related to a PMA-induced AP-1 and a PMA/A23187-induced NF-AT .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> signal transducing components in T cells can activate transcription of the GM-CSF gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Cotransfection of NF-kappa B (p50/p65)- or AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos)- expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM-CSF promoter did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , cotransfection with a combination of NF-kappa B and AP-1 significantly augmented transcription from the GM-CSF promoter containing the GM-kappa B/GC-box and the CLE0 ( AP-1/NF-AT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Expression of a constitutively active calcineurin ( CN ) , a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase , potentiated by two fold the transcriptional activation by NF-kappa B/AP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Both constitutively active forms of CN and protein kinase C ( PKC ) synergistically activated transcription from the GM-CSF promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that cooperation among NF-kappa B- , AP-1- and NF-AT-binding sequences is required for induction of the GM-CSF gene through PKC- and Ca2+- signaling pathways downstream of T cell activation</scope> .</sentence>
