<sentence id="0">Identification of an I kappa B alpha-associated protein kinase in a human monocytic cell line and determination of its phosphorylation sites on I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) is stored in the cytoplasm as an inactive form through interaction with I kappa B. Stimulation of cells leads to a rapid phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which is <cue type="spec" id="0">presumed</cue> to be important for the subsequent degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have recently reported the establishment of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent cell-free activation system of NF-kappa B in association with the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we have identified a kinase in cell extracts from the LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line , THP-1 , that specifically binds and phosphorylates I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">LPS stimulation transiently enhanced the I kappa B alpha-bound kinase activity in THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutational analyses of I kappa B alpha and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as Ser and Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , we show that the peptide , corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of I kappa B alpha , blocked the LPS-induced NF-kappa B activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous I kappa B alpha in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of I kappa B alpha and subsequent dissociation of the NF-kappa B.I kappa B alpha complex</scope> .</sentence>
