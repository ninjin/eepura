<sentence id="2">Transgenic mice with a lymphocyte-specific defect in NF-kappaB activation were produced by targeted expression of human IkappaB alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The thymic cellularity of these mice was significantly decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The proportion of mature , TCRhigh thymocytes of the alphabeta lineage was reduced , and the remaining TCRhigh population contained an unusually high proportion of double-positive cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This defect in maturation resulted in a transgene dose-dependent reduction in peripheral T lymphocytes , with the CD8 lineage being more severely affected .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data provide direct evidence for the involvement of NF-kappaB/Rel family proteins in late stages of T lymphocyte development , coincident with positive and negative selection .</sentence>
