<sentence id="0">The p53 paradox in the pathogenesis of tumor progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent evidence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that the p53 molecule appears in two different forms : the mutant p53 that stimulates tumor progression , and wild type p53 that inhibits tumor progression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , it has been established that tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) can activate the expression of wild type p53 in concert with the nuclear transcription factor , NF-kappa B. Both TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B are also involved in the stimulation of the pathway that leads to the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules and , hence , antigen presentation to the T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this paper we shall <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">advance the</cue> hypothesis that : ( i ) TNF-alpha indirectly controls immune surveillance ; and ( ii ) TNF-alpha controls DNA repair and tumor suppression through the regulation of wild type p53</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus , it is <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesized</cue> that elevated TNF-alpha is primarily responsible for promoting tumor progression</scope> .</sentence>
