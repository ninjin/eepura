<sentence id="3">Adhesion of human monocytes to P-selectin , the most rapidly expressed endothelial tethering factor , increased the secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) by the leukocytes when they were stimulated with platelet-activating factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Increased cytokine secretion was specifically inhibited by G1 , an anti-P-selectin mAb that prevents P-selectin from binding to its ligand ( P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 ) on myeloid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , tethering by P-selectin specifically enhanced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , a transcription factor required for expression of MCP-1 , TNF-alpha , and other immediate-early genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results demonstrate that P-selectin , through its ligands on monocytes , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> locally regulate cytokine secretion in inflamed tissues</scope> .</sentence>
