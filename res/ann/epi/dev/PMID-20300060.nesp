<sentence id="0">UTX mediates demethylation of H3K27me3 at muscle-specific genes during myogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Polycomb ( PcG ) and Trithorax ( TrxG ) group proteins act antagonistically to establish tissue-specific patterns of gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The PcG protein Ezh2 facilitates repression by catalysing histone H3-Lys27 trimethylation ( H3K27me3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For expression , H3K27me3 marks are removed and replaced by TrxG protein catalysed histone H3-Lys4 trimethylation ( H3K4me3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although H3K27 demethylases have been identified , <scope type="neg" id="0">the mechanism by which these enzymes are targeted to specific genomic regions to remove H3K27me3 marks has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been established</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we demonstrate a two-step mechanism for UTX-mediated demethylation at muscle-specific genes during myogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although the transactivator Six4 initially recruits UTX to the regulatory region of muscle genes , the resulting loss of H3K27me3 marks is limited to the region upstream of the transcriptional start site .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Removal of the repressive H3K27me3 mark within the coding region then requires RNA Polymerase II ( Pol II ) elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Interestingly , blocking Pol II elongation on transcribed genes leads to increased H3K27me3 within the coding region , and formation of bivalent ( H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ) chromatin domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , removal of repressive H3K27me3 marks by UTX occurs through targeted recruitment followed by spreading across the gene .</sentence>
