<sentence id="0">TRIM21 is essential to sustain IFN regulatory factor 3 activation during antiviral response .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Virus infection induces host antiviral responses including induction of type I IFNs .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 ( IRF3 ) plays an essential role and is tightly regulated in this process .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Herein we report that TRIM21 ( tripartite motif-containing 21 ) is significantly induced and interacts with IRF3 upon RNA virus infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Ectopic expression or knockdown of TRIM21 could respectively enhance or impair IRF3-mediated gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mechanistically , TRIM21 interferes with the interaction between Pin1 ( peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase , NIMA-interacting 1 ) and IRF3 , thus preventing IRF3 ubiquitination and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A conserved motif in the B 30.2 domain of TRIM21 is critical for its modulation of IRF3 function , while the RING finger is dispensable .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Host antiviral responses are significantly boosted or crippled in the presence or absence of TRIM21 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results identify TRIM21 as an essential modulator of IRF3 stability and demonstrate that it positively regulates the strength and duration of primary antiviral response , thus further strengthening the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">notion</cue> that the TRIM family is evolutionarily integrated with innate immunity</scope> .</sentence>
