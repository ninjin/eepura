<sentence id="0">Recombinant fish neurotrophin-6 is a heparin-binding glycoprotein : implications for a role in axonal guidance .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Neurotrophin-6 ( NT-6 ) was identified in the teleost fish Xiphophorus as a new member of the neurotrophin gene family .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">NT-6 binds specifically the glycosaminoglycan heparin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study NT-6 was expressed in a stably transfected mammalian cell line , and in insect cells via a recombinant baculovirus .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It was purified to homogeneity and characterized by MS and N-terminal sequencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NT-6 from both expression systems was proteolytically processed at one of two protease cleavage motifs and was found to be glycosylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It supported the survival of embryonic chick sensory neurons ; half-maximal survival was observed at 100 ng/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , NT-6 elicited neurite outgrowth in explanted embryonic dorsal root ganglia .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Addition of heparin into the medium did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> potentiate the activity of NT-6 in survival assays</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , when a sensory ganglion explant was cultured in a collagen gel matrix assay adjacent to a heparin bead coated with NT-6 , neurite outgrowth directed towards the bead was observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> NT-6 was slowly released from the heparin bead generating a concentration gradient of NT-6 instrumental for axonal guidance in vitro</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Thus <scope type="spec" id="3"> the interaction of NT-6 with heparin <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> be required for the activation of the cellular receptor for NT-6 on responsive cells</scope> but rather <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> serve to control</scope> , in vivo</scope> , the distribution of NT-6 .</sentence>
