<sentence id="0">RIG-I-like receptors : sensing and responding to RNA virus infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Viral and microbial pathogens contain specific motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) that are recognized by cell surface- and endosome-associated Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">RNA virus infection is also detected through TLR-independent mechanisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Early viral replicative intermediates are detected by two recently characterized cystolic viral RNA receptors-RIG-I and MDA-5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both are DExDH/box RNA helicases , and RIG-I specifically recognizes 5'-triphosphate containing viral RNA and transmits signals that induce type I interferon-mediated host immunity against virus infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this review , we will focus on RIG-I-like receptor ( RLR ) signal transduction and the regulatory mechanisms - ubiquitination , deubiquitination , ISGylation - underlying this important host response .</sentence>
