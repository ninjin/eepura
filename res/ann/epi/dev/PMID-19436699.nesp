<sentence id="0">Atg5-independent sequestration of ubiquitinated mycobacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Like several other intracellular pathogens , Mycobacterium marinum ( Mm ) escapes from phagosomes into the host cytosol where it can polymerize actin , leading to motility that promotes spread to neighboring cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , only approximately 25 % of internalized Mm form actin tails , and the fate of the remaining bacteria has been unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that cytosolic access results in a new and intricate host pathogen interaction : host macrophages ubiquitinate Mm , while Mm shed their ubiquitinated cell walls .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Phagosomal escape and ubiquitination of Mm occurred rapidly , prior to 3.5 hours post infection ; at the same time , ubiquitinated Mm cell wall material mixed with host-derived dense membrane networks appeared in close proximity to cytosolic bacteria , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> cell wall shedding and association with remnants of the lysed phagosome</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">At 24 hours post-infection , Mm that polymerized actin were <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> ubiquitinated , whereas ubiquitinated Mm were found within LAMP-1-positive vacuoles resembling lysosomes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Though double membranes were observed which sequestered Mm away from the cytosol , targeting of Mm to the LAMP-1-positive vacuoles was independent of classical autophagy , as demonstrated by <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of LC3 association</scope> and by Atg5-independence of their formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Further , ubiquitination and LAMP-1 association did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> occur with mutant avirulent Mm lacking ESX-1 ( type VII ) secretion , which <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">fail</cue> to escape the primary phagosome</scope></scope> ; apart from its function in phagosome escape , ESX-1 was <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> directly required for Mm ubiquitination in macrophages or in vitro</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that virulent Mm follow two distinct paths in the cytosol of infected host cells</scope> : bacterial ubiquitination is followed by sequestration into lysosome-like organelles via an autophagy-independent pathway , while cell wall shedding <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> allow escape from this fate to permit continued residence in the cytosol and formation of actin tails</scope> .</sentence>
