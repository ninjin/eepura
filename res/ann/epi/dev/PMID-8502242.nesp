<sentence id="0">Control of IgG/Fc glycosylation : a comparison of oligosaccharides from chimeric human/mouse and mouse subclass immunoglobulin Gs.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oligosaccharide profiles were obtained for chimeric mouse-human antibodies corresponding to each of the human IgG subclasses 1-4 , and mouse IgG2b antibodies each expressed in the mouse J558L cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These antibodies have specificity for the NIP hapten and form a matched set of IgGs .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An IgG4 chimeric antibody ( B72.3 ) produced in the chinese hamster ovary ( CHO-K1 ) cell line was also analysed for carbohydrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Additionally aglycosylated mutants of this IgG4 ( B72.3 ) and anti-NIP mouse IgG2b were analysed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The total lack of carbohydrate found in the aglycosylated site-directed mutants human chimeric IgG4 B72.3 ( Asn 297-->Gln ) and mouse IgG2b ( Asn 297-->Ala ) demonstrates that there are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> N-glycosylation sites other than Asn 297</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore glycosylation profiles for all the IgGs analysed reflect carbohydrate attached to this site .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Factors such as cell type ( A ) , template direction by the IgG heavy chains ( B ) and culture conditions ( C ) are shown to influence IgG glycosylation profiles .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">( A ) The anti-NIP IgG antibodies expressed by the J558L cell line <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> have one or two Gal ( alpha 1-->3 ) Gal residues per oligosaccharide unit , indicative of the presence of ( alpha 1-->3 ) galactosyl transferase in the J558L mouse cell line</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">( B ) The galactosylation profiles obtained for the IgG heavy chains , in particular the preference for galactosylation of the Man ( alpha 1-->6 ) arm <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">rather than</cue> the Man ( alpha 1-->3 ) arm , contrary to the beta-galactosyltransferase specificity</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the polypeptide chain <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> act as a template to influence the extent of galactosylation and hence the proportions of each oligosaccharide incorporated</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The IgG2 antibody does <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> display this galactosylation preference</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="spec" id="7"> ( C ) The extent of galactosylation <cue type="spec" id="7">appears</cue> to be influenced by the growth conditions , with the highest levels of galactosylation being found for IgG produced by cells grown in still cultures , <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">rather than</cue> cells grown as ascites or in hollow fibre bioreactors</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">It is concluded that though the profile of glycosylation is controlled predominantly by the glycosylation activity of the cell in which the IgG is expressed , differences between the IgG heavy chain templates of the various subclasses and culture conditions can also influence glycosylation .</sentence>
