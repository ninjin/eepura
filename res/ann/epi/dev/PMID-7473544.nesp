<sentence id="0">Hydroxylated aromatic inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Efficient replication of HIV-1 requires integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into a chromosome of the host cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase , and we have previously reported that phenolic moieties in compounds such as flavones , caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( CAPE , 2 ) , and curcumin confer inhibitory activity against HIV-1 integrase .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We now extend these findings by performing a comprehensive structure-activity relationship using CAPE analogues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Approximately 30 compounds have been prepared as HIV integrase inhibitors based on the structural lead provided by CAPE , which has previously been shown to exhibit an IC50 value of 7 microM in our integration assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These analogues were designed to examine specific features of the parent CAPE structure which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be important for activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Among the features examined for their effects on inhibitory potency were ring substitution , side chain length and composition , and phenyl ring conformational orientation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In an assay which measured the combined effect of two sequential steps , dinucleotide cleavage and strand transfer , several analogues have IC50 values for 3'-processing and strand transfer lower than those of CAPE .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Inhibition of strand transfer was assayed using both blunt-ended and " precleaved " DNA substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Disintegration using an integrase mutant <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacking</cue> the N-terminal zinc finger and C-terminal DNA-binding domains</scope> was also inhibited by these analogues , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that the binding site for these compounds resides in the central catalytic core</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Several CAPE analogues were also tested for selective activity against transformed cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the development of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be based upon inhibition of HIV-1 integrase</scope> .</sentence>
