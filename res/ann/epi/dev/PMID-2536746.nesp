<sentence id="0">Microthrombomodulin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Residues 310-486 from the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain of thrombomodulin will accelerate protein C activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Thrombomodulin is the endothelial cell cofactor for thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , we isolated a 10-kDa thrombin binding fragment , CB3 , from the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain ( epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like regions ) of thrombomodulin ( Kurasawa , S. , Stearns , D. J. , Jackson , K.W. , and Esmon , C.T. ( 1988 ) J. Biol. Chem. 263 , 5993-5996 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The CB3 fragment did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> , however , support protein C activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A 29-kDa fragment , called CB23 , has now been isolated and corresponds to residues 310-486 in the EGF-like region of thrombomodulin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The CB23 fragment bound thrombin and accelerated thrombin-catalyzed protein C activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">With two separate preparations of CB23 , the Km for protein C was 1.6 and 1.9 microM and the Kd for thrombin was 8.9 and 13.2 nM .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The carboxyl terminus of CB23 and CB3 was identified by isolation and sequence analysis of a tryptic peptide from CB3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The sequence of this peptide corresponded to Asn457-Ser486 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the carboxyl terminus of these fragments is 6 residues beyond the sixth EGF-like region of thrombomodulin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In addition , although CB3 cannot accelerate protein C activation , CB3 did inhibit the rate of thrombin-catalyzed fibrinopeptide release from fibrinogen .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Thus , like native thrombomodulin , CB3 will alter thrombin 's substrate specificity , but protein C activation requires additional information all of which can be provided by other regions of the EGF-like domain .</sentence>
