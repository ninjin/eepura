<sentence id="0">Glycosylation of CD4 and Thy-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The site-specific glycosylation of soluble recombinant variants of human and rat CD4 ( sCD4 ) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells has been characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The presence of identical oligosaccharides at the conserved glycosylation site in domain 3 of rat and human sCD4 and the greater abundance of oligomannose and hybrid type glycans at the non-conserved glycosylation site of rat sCD4 clearly <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> the protein structure influences oligosaccharide processing</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Comparisons of rat sCD4 glycopeptides with mutant molecules with only single glycosylation sites and with a truncated form containing only the two NH2-terminal domains , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> independent processing occurs at each glycosylation site and that domain interactions can also affect oligosaccharide processing</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These and other analyses of sCD2 expressed in CHO cells and Thy-1 purified from various tissues <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the diversity of oligosaccharide structures on a protein is regulated by the location of the glycosylation sites and the nature of the target protein , cell and tissue</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The functional significance of this control remains to be determined .</sentence>
