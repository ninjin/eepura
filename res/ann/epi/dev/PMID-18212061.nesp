<sentence id="0">The histone-like NF-Y is a bifunctional transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-Y is a trimeric transcription factor containing H2A/H2B-like subunits , which specifically binds to the CCAAT box , a common eukaryotic promoter element .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To gain insights into NF-Y-dependent transcriptional regulation , we assessed its relationships with positive histone marks by chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip and correlative-profiling studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Unbiased identification of binding sites shows that the majority of genes are bound by NF-Y in the promoter and/or within the coding region .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Parallel analysis of H3K9-14ac and H3K4me3 sites <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> NF-Y loci can be divided in two distinct clusters : ( i ) a large cohort contains H3K9-14ac and H3K4me3 marks and correlates with expression and ( ii ) a sizeable group is devoid of these marks and is found on transcriptionally silent genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Within this class , we find that NF-Y binding is associated with negative histone marks , such as H4K20me3 and H3K27me3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">NF-Y removal by a dominant negative NF-YA leads to a decrease in the transcription of expressed genes associated with H3K4me3 and H3K9-14ac , while increasing the levels of many inactive genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> NF-Y is embedded in positive as well as in negative methyl histone marks , serving a dual function in transcriptional regulation , as an activator or as a repressor</scope> .</sentence>
