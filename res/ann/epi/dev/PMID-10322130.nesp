<sentence id="0">DNA methylation and chromatin modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">DNA methylation and chromatin modification are two global mechanisms that regulate gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recent studies provide insight into the mechanism of transcriptional silencing by a methyl-CpG binding protein , MeCP2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">MeCP2 is shown to interact with the Sin3/histone deacetylase co-repressor complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus , this interaction can provide a mechanistic explanation for the long-known relationship between DNA methylation and chromatin structure .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , several studies have shown that inhibition of histone deacetylases by specific inhibitors can reactivate endogenous genes or reporter constructs previously silenced by DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , the data strongly <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that DNA methylation can pattern chromatin modification</scope> .</sentence>
