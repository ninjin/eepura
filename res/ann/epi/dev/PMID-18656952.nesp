<sentence id="0">Chemical and structural probing of the N-terminal residues encoded by FMR1 exon 15 and their effect on downstream arginine methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Exon 15 of the fragile X mental retardation protein gene ( FMR1 ) is alternatively spliced into three variants .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The amino acids encoded by the 5' end of the exon contain several regulatory determinants including phosphorylation sites and a potential conformational switch .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Residues encoded by the 3' end of the exon specify FMRP 's RGG box , an RNA binding domain that interacts with G-quartet motifs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Previous studies demonstrated that the exon 15-encoded N-terminal residues influence the extent of arginine methylation , independent of S 500 phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the present study we focus on the role the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> conformational switch</scope> plays in arginine methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Chemical and structural probing of Ex15 alternatively spliced variant proteins and several mutants leads to the following conclusions : Ex15c resides largely in a conformation that is refractory toward methylation ; however , it can be methylated by supplementing extracts with recombinant PRMT1 or PRMT3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Protein modeling studies reveal that the RG-rich region is part of a three to four strand antiparallel beta-sheet , which in other RNA binding proteins functions as a platform for nucleic acid interactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In the Ex15c variant the first strand of this sheet is truncated , and this significantly perturbs the side-chain conformations of the arginine residues in the RG-rich region .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Mutating R 507 in the conformational switch to K also truncates the first strand of the beta-sheet , and corresponding decreases in in vitro methylation were found for this and R 507/R 544 and R 507/R 546 double mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These effects are <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> due to the loss of R 507 methylation as a conformational switch-containing peptide reacted under substrate excess and in methyl donor excess was not significantly methylated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Consistent with this , similar changes in beta-sheet structure and decreases in in vitro methylation were observed with a W 513-K mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These data support a novel model for FMRP arginine methylation and a role for conformational switch residues in arginine modification .</sentence>
