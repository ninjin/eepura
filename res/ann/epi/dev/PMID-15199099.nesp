<sentence id="0">Redox state regulates HIF-1alpha and its DNA binding and phosphorylation in salmonid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) is a heterodimeric transcription factor structurally similar to mammalian HIF-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It consists of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits , of which the HIF-1alpha subunit confers the hypoxia sensitivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">HIF-1alpha is rapidly degraded by a proteasome under normal oxygen ( 21 % O2 ) conditions , mainly as a result of prolyl hydroxylation needed for protein destabilization .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although prolyl hydroxylation at conserved proline residues is a major factor controlling HIF-1alpha stability , the redox state of the cells <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> , in addition , influence the function of HIF-1alpha like proteins by influencing their stability , DNA binding and phosphorylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sensitivity of the protein to oxidation/reduction <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be due to cysteine residues at critical positions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The predicted amino acid sequence of rainbow trout HIF-1alpha contains several unique cysteine residues , notably in the DNA-binding area at position 28 and in the transactivation domain of the molecule in the vicinity of the conserved proline residue at position 564 of mammalian HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the present studies we have investigated <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">if</cue> the redox state influences HIF-1alpha stability , DNA binding and phosphorylation in two established salmonid cell lines RTG-2 and CHSE-214</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> reducing conditions , achieved using N-propylgallate ( nPG ) or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , stabilize HIF-1alpha , facilitate its DNA binding , and increase its phosphorylation even under normal oxygen conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">On the other hand , oxidizing conditions , achieved using L-buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) dampen the hypoxia response .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , the hypoxia-like effect of cobalt is increased in the presence of the reducing agent .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">On the basis of these results , we <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that redox state influences the accessibility of the conserved prolyl residues to oxygen-dependent hydroxylation and the accessibility of the residues involved in the phosphorylation of HIF-1alpha</scope> .</sentence>
