<sentence id="0">Regulated degradation of spindle assembly factors by the anaphase-promoting complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex ( APC/C ) is essential for cell division in all eukaryotes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Loss of APC/C activity arrests cells at metaphase and results in severe aberrations of the mitotic spindle , but how the APC/C regulates spindle formation is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report that the APC/C promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of four proteins required for Ran-dependent spindle assembly : Bard1 , Hmmr , HURP , and NuSAP .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Among these substrates , HURP and NuSAP can be degraded during spindle formation when the spindle checkpoint is active .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Their degradation requires additional layers of regulation , and both SAFs are only degraded after being released from their inhibitor importin beta by Ran(GTP) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our findings reveal a tightly regulated mechanism by which the APC/C and the GTPase Ran control the abundance of active spindle assembly factors to achieve the accurate formation of the mitotic spindle .</sentence>
