<sentence id="0">Adenosine stimulation of AMP deaminase activity in adult rat cardiac myocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using an in situ assay for analyzing AMP deaminase activity in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes , we have shown that IMP production is stimulated approximately twofold in cardiac cells incubated with 10 microM adenosine .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="neg" id="0">This effect of adenosine was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> blocked by the adenosine A1-receptor antagonist 8-cyclophenyl-1,3-dipropylaxanthine ( 0.01-1 microM ) except at a concentration ( 100 microM ) that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> inhibit adenosine transport</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Similarly , <scope type="neg" id="2">in situ AMP deaminase activity was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> enhanced by treatment with the specific adenosine A1-receptor agonists N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine or cyclopentyladenosine</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">nor</cue> was it sensitive to prior treatment of cells with pertussis toxin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The nucleoside transport blockers S-4-nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine , dipyridamole , and papaverine inhibited adenosine-induced increases in IMP production by 75-85 % , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> an intracellular site of action</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="5">Modulation of enzyme activity via the transmethylation pathway <cue type="neg" id="5">could not</cue> be implicated since incubation of cardiac cells under conditions known to elevate intracellular S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine had <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> demonstrable effect on AMP deaminase</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , <scope type="neg" id="7">a direct allosteric effect of adenosine on the partially purified rat cardiac enzyme was <cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> observed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">indicate that</cue> intracellular adenosine modulates rat cardiac AMP deaminase by an <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">unknown</cue> mechanism</scope></scope> .</sentence>
