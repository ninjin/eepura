Hydroxylated aromatic inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase. 
Efficient replication of HIV-1 requires integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into a chromosome of the host cell. Integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase, and we have previously reported that phenolic moieties in compounds such as flavones, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE, 2), and curcumin confer inhibitory activity against HIV-1 integrase. We now extend these findings by performing a comprehensive structure-activity relationship using CAPE analogues. Approximately 30 compounds have been prepared as HIV integrase inhibitors based on the structural lead provided by CAPE, which has previously been shown to exhibit an IC50 value of 7 microM in our integration assay. These analogues were designed to examine specific features of the parent CAPE structure which may be important for activity. Among the features examined for their effects on inhibitory potency were ring substitution, side chain length and composition, and phenyl ring conformational orientation. In an assay which measured the combined effect of two sequential steps, dinucleotide cleavage and strand transfer, several analogues have IC50 values for 3'-processing and strand transfer lower than those of CAPE. Inhibition of strand transfer was assayed using both blunt-ended and "precleaved" DNA substrates. Disintegration using an integrase mutant lacking the N-terminal zinc finger and C-terminal DNA-binding domains was also inhibited by these analogues, suggesting that the binding site for these compounds resides in the central catalytic core. Several CAPE analogues were also tested for selective activity against transformed cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the development of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be based upon inhibition of HIV-1 integrase.
