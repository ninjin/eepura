<sentence id="0">Polyubiquitination of prolactin receptor stimulates its internalization , postinternalization sorting , and degradation via the lysosomal pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The ubiquitination of the receptor that mediates signaling induced by the polypeptide pituitary hormone prolactin ( PRL ) has been shown to lead to the degradation of this receptor and to the ensuing negative regulation of cellular responses to PRL .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the mechanisms of PRL receptor ( PRLr ) proteolysis remain largely to be determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we provide evidence that PRLr is internalized and primarily degraded via the lysosomal pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Ubiquitination of PRLr is essential for the rapid internalization of PRLr , which proceeds through a pathway dependent on clathrin and the assembly polypeptide 2 ( AP2 ) adaptor complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Recruitment of AP2 to PRLr is stimulated by PRLr ubiquitination , which also is required for the targeting of already internalized PRLr to the lysosomal compartment .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">While mass spectrometry analysis revealed that both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination ( via both K48- and K63-linked chains ) occur on PRLr , the results of experiments using forced expression of ubiquitin mutants <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> PRLr polyubiquitination via K63-linked chains is important for efficient interaction of PRLr with AP2 as well as for efficient internalization , postinternalization sorting , and proteolytic turnover of PRLr</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We discuss how specific ubiquitination <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> regulate early and late stages of endocytosis of PRLr and of related receptors to contribute to the negative regulation of the magnitude and duration of downstream signaling</scope> .</sentence>
