<sentence id="0">Regulation of virus-triggered signaling by OTUB1- and OTUB2-mediated deubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ubiquitination and deubiquitination have emerged as critical post-translational regulatory mechanisms for activation or attenuation of the virus-triggered type I interferon (IFN)(2 ) induction pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we identified two deubiquitinating enzymes , OTUB1 and OTUB2 , as negative regulators of virus-triggered type I IFN induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Overexpression of OTUB1 and OTUB2 inhibited virus-induced activation of IRF3 and NF-kappaB , transcription of the IFNB1 gene as well as cellular antiviral response , whereas knockdown of OTUB1 and OTUB2 had opposite effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Coimmunoprecipitations <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated</cue> OTUB1 and -2 interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6 , two E3 ubiquitin ligases required for virus-triggered IRF3 and NF-kappaB activation , respectively</scope> .</sentence>
