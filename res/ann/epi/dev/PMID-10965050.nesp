<sentence id="0">Protein N-arginine methylation in subcellular fractions of lymphoblastoid cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Arginine methylation in RNA-binding proteins containing arginine- and glycine-rich RGG motifs is catalyzed by specific protein arginine N-methyltransferase in cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously showed that lymphoblastoid cells grown in the presence of an indirect methyltransferase inhibitor , adenosine dialdehyde ( AdOx ) , accumulated high level of hypomethylated protein substrates for the endogenous protein methyltransferases or recombinant yeast arginine methyltransferase [ Li , C. et al. ( 1998 ) Arch. Biochem. Biophys . 351 , 53-59 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study we fractionated the lymphoblastoid cells to locate the methyltransferases and the substrates in cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Different sets of hypomethylated methyl-accepting polypeptides with wide range of molecular masses were present in cytosolic , ribosomal , and nucleus fractions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The methylated amino acid residues of the methyl-accepting proteins in these fractions were determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In all three fractions , dimethylarginine was the most abundant methylated amino acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The protein-arginine methyltransferase activities in the three fractions were analyzed using recombinant fibrillarin ( a nucleolar RGG protein ) as the methyl-accepting substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Fibrillarin methylation was strongest in the presence of the cytosolic fraction , followed by the ribosomal and then the nucleus fractions .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The results demonstrated that protein-arginine methyltransferases as well as their methyl-accepting substrates were widely distributed in different subcellular fractions of lymphoblastoid cells .</sentence>
