<sentence id="1">Processive versus distributive methyl group transfer was assessed for pea Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase , a SET domain protein lysine methyltransferase catalyzing the formation of trimethyllysine-14 in the large subunit of Rubisco .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Catalytically competent complexes between an immobilized form of des(methyl) Rubisco and Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase were used to demonstrate enzyme release that was co-incident with and dependent on formation of trimethyllysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Catalytic rate constants determined for formation of trimethyllysine were considerably lower ( approximately 10-fold ) than rate constants determined for total radiolabel incorporation from [3H-methyl]-S-adenosylmethionine .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Double-reciprocal velocity plots under catalytic conditions favoring monomethyllysine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated</cue> a random or ordered reaction mechanism</scope> , while conditions favoring trimethyllysine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> a hybrid ping-pong mechanism</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results were compared with double-reciprocal velocity plots and product analyses obtained for HsSET7/9 ( a monomethyltransferase ) and SpCLR4 ( a dimethyltransferase ) and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> a predictive ability of double-reciprocal velocity plots for single versus multiple methyl group transfers by SET domain protein lysine methyltransferases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="3"> A model is <cue type="spec" id="3">proposed</cue> for SET domain protein lysine methyltransferases in which initial binding of polypeptide substrate and S-adenosylmethionine is random , with polypeptide binding followed by deprotonation of the epsilon-amine of the target lysyl residue and subsequent methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Following methyl group transfer , S-adenosylhomocysteine and monomethylated polypeptide dissociate from monomethyltransferases , but di- and trimethyltransferases begin a successive and catalytically obligatory deprotonation of enzyme-bound methylated lysyl intermediates , which along with binding and release of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine is manifested as a hybrid ping-pong-like reaction mechanism .</sentence>
