Role of glycosylation in the organic anion transporter OAT1. 
Organic anion transporters (OAT) play essential roles in the body disposition of clinically important anionic drugs, including antiviral drugs, antitumor drugs, antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anti-inflammatories. We reported previously (Kuze, K., Graves, P., Leahy, A., Wilson, P., Stuhlmann, H., and You, G. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1519-1524) that tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation, significantly inhibited organic anion transport in COS-7 cells expressing a mouse organic anion transporter (mOAT1), suggesting an important role of glycosylation in mOAT1 function. In the present study, we investigated the effect of disrupting putative glycosylation sites in mOAT1 as well as its human counterpart, hOAT1, by mutating asparagine to glutamine and assessing mutant transporters in HeLa cells. We showed that the putative glycosylation site Asp-39 in mOAT1 was not glycosylated but the corresponding site (Asp-39) in hOAT1 was glycosylated. Disrupting Asp-39 resulted in a complete loss of transport activity in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 without affecting their cell surface expression, suggesting that the loss of function is not because of deglycosylation of Asp-39 per se but rather is likely because of the change of this important amino acid critically involved in the substrate binding. Single replacement of asparagines at other sites had no effect on transport activity indicating that glycosylation at individual sites is not essential for OAT function. In contrast, a simultaneous replacement of all asparagines in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 impaired the trafficking of the transporters to the plasma membrane. In summary, we provided the evidence that 1) Asp-39 is crucially involved in substrate recognition of OAT1, 2) glycosylation at individual sites is not required for OAT1 function, and 3) glycosylation plays an important role in the targeting of OAT1 onto the plasma membrane. This study is the first molecular identification and characterization of glycosylation of OAT1 and may provide important insights into the structure-function relationships of the organic anion transporter family.
