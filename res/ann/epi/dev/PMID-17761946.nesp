<sentence id="0">The transcription factor snail mediates epithelial to mesenchymal transitions by repression of estrogen receptor-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha ( ESR1 ) is a key regulatory molecule in mammary epithelial cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Loss of ER-alpha in breast cancer is correlated with poor prognosis , increased recurrence after treatment , and an elevated incidence of metastasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A proposed molecular pathway by which ER-alpha acts to constrain invasive growth in breast cancer cells involves direct , ER-alpha-dependent expression of metastasis-associated protein 3 , a cell-type-specific component of the Mi-2/NuRD chromatin remodeling complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">MTA3 in turn represses expression of Snail , a transcription factor linked to epithelial to mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To elucidate its role(s) in epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , we expressed Snail in the noninvasive , ER-alpha-positive MCF-7 cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Snail expression led to decreased cell-cell adhesion and increased cell invasiveness .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , we observed loss of ER-alpha expression at both the RNA and protein level that was accompanied by direct interaction of Snail with regulatory DNA sequences at the ESR1 locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A consequence of loss of ER-alpha function in this system was the increased abundance of key components of the TGF-beta signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , <scope type="spec" id="0"> cross-talk among ER-alpha , Snail , and the TGF-beta pathway <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to control critical phenotypic properties of breast cancer cells</scope> .</sentence>
