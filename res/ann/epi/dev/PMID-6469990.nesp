<sentence id="0">Arylamine N-acetyltransferase and arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase in the mammalian pineal gland .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Amine N-acetylation in the pineal gland is of special importance because it is the first step in the synthesis of melatonin from serotonin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study the N-acetylation of arylamines and arylalkylamines by homogenates of rat and sheep pineal glands was investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The arylamines studied were p-phenetidine and aniline ; the arylalkylamines studied were tryptamine , serotonin , 5-methoxytryptamine , 6-fluorotryptamine , and phenylethylamine .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These amines were acetylated by pineal homogenates of both species , although marked interspecies differences in apparent Km and Vmax values were found .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A series of observations in both species <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> aromatic amine N-acetylation is catalyzed by two distinct enzymes</scope> ; one preferentially acetylates arylamines and the other preferentially acetylates arylalkylamines .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">First , isoproterenol treatment of the rat increased arylalkylamine N-acetylation 100-fold <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> increasing arylamine N-acetylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Second , cycloheximide treatment in sheep reduced arylalkylamine N-acetylation at night to one-tenth control values , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> altering arylamine N-acetylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Third , arylamine N-acetyltransferase and arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase inactivated at different rates at 4 degrees C. Fourth , the two enzymes were resolved by size exclusion chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results clearly establish that the pineal gland contains an arylamine N-acetyltransferase and a second , independently regulated arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase <scope type="spec" id="3"> which <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to be primarily responsible for the physiological conversion of serotonin to melatonin via the intermediate N-acetylserotonin</scope> .</sentence>
