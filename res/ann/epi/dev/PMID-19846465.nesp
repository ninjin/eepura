<sentence id="0">Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 and CRTAP are mutually stabilizing in the endoplasmic reticulum collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Null mutations in cartilage-associated protein ( CRTAP ) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 ( P3H1/LEPRE1 ) cause types VII and VIII OI , respectively , two novel recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) with severe to lethal bone dysplasia and overmodification of the type I collagen helical region .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CRTAP and P3H1 form a complex with cyclophilin B ( CyPB ) in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) which 3-hydroxylates the Pro986 residue of alpha1(I) and alpha1(II) collagen chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We investigated the interaction of complex components in fibroblasts from types VII and VIII OI patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both CRTAP and P3H1 are absent or reduced on western blots and by immunofluorescence microscopy in cells containing null mutations in either gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Levels of LEPRE1 or CRTAP transcripts , however , are normal in CRTAP- or LEPRE1-null cells , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Stable transfection of a CRTAP or LEPRE1 expression construct into cells with null mutations for the transfected cDNA restored both CRTAP and P3H1 protein levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Normalization of collagen helical modification in transfected CRTAP-null cells demonstrated that the restored proteins functioned effectively as a complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> CRTAP and P3H1 are mutually stabilized in the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CyPB levels were unaffected by mutations in either CRTAP or LEPRE1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Proteasomal inhibitors partially rescue P3H1 protein in CRTAP-null cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In LEPRE1-null cells , secretion of CRTAP is increased compared with control cells and accounts for 15-20 % of the decreased CRTAP detected in cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Thus , mutual stabilization of P3H1 and CRTAP in the ER collagen modification complex is an underlying mechanism for the overlapping phenotype of types VII and VIII OI .</sentence>
