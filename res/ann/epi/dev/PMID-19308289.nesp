<sentence id="0">PDCD5 interacts with Tip60 and functions as a cooperator in acetyltransferase activity and DNA damage-induced apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tip60 is a histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) involved in the acetyltransferase activity and the cellular response to DNA damage .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that programmed cell death 5 ( PDCD5 ) , a human apoptosis-related protein , binds to Tip60 and enhances the stability of Tip60 protein in unstressed conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The binding amount of PDCD5 and Tip60 is significantly increased after UV irradiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Further , PDCD5 enhances HAT activity of Tip60 and Tip60-dependent histone acetylation in both basal and UV-induced levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also find that PDCD5 increases Tip60-dependent K120 acetylation of p53 and participates in the p53-dependent expression of apoptosis-related genes , such as Bax .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , we demonstrate the biological significance of the PDCD5-Tip60 interaction ; that is , they function in cooperation to accelerate DNA damage-induced apoptosis and knockdown of PDCD5 or Tip60 impairs their apoptosis-accelerating activity , mutually .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with this , PDCD5 levels increase significantly on DNA damage in U2OS cells , as does Tip60 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> PDCD5 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play a dual role in the Tip60 pathway</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Specifically , under normal growth conditions , PDCD5 contributes to maintaining a basal pool of Tip60 and its HAT activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">After DNA damage , PDCD5 functions as a Tip60 coactivator to promote apoptosis .</sentence>
