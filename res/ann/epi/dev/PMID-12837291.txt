Chromatin-dependent regulation of the MMTV promoter by cAMP signaling is mediated through distinct pathways. 
The nucleoprotein structure of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter defines its response to cAMP signaling. A stably replicating MMTV template in highly organized chromatin is repressed in the presence of cAMP, whereas a transiently transfected template with a disorganized structure is activated. In this study, we investigate the nature of the cAMP-induced signal(s) by which these opposing responses occur to gain insight into their mechanism. We demonstrate that the transcriptional changes observed at both templates are mediated through cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). In addition, the MMTV promoter lacks a consensus cAMP response element (CRE) and neither template requires cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to elicit a response to cAMP signaling. However, the responses of the two templates differ mechanistically in that the CREB-binding protein p300 potentiates activation from the transient template in a manner dependent on its Cys/His-rich region 3, but does not appear to affect the repression of the replicating chromatin template. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that cAMP treatment results in a decrease in acetylation of histone H4, and in multiple modifications of histone H3 at specific nucleosomes in the promoter region of the stable MMTV template. These findings suggest novel CREB-independent, chromatin-dependent pathways for transcriptional regulation by cAMP.
