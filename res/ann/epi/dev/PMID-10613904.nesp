<sentence id="0">ER/Golgi intermediates acquire Golgi enzymes by brefeldin A-sensitive retrograde transport in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Secretory proteins exit the ER in transport vesicles that fuse to form vesicular tubular clusters ( VTCs ) which move along microtubule tracks to the Golgi apparatus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using the well-characterized in vitro approach to study the properties of Golgi membranes , we determined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the Golgi enzyme NAGT I is transported to ER/Golgi intermediates</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Secretory cargo was arrested at distinct steps of the secretory pathway of a glycosylation mutant cell line , and in vitro complementation of the glycosylation defect was determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Complementation yield increased after ER exit of secretory cargo and was optimal when transport was blocked at an ER/Golgi intermediate step .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The rapid drop of the complementation yield as secretory cargo progresses into the stack <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that Golgi enzymes are preferentially targeted to ER/Golgi intermediates and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> to membranes of the Golgi stack</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Two mechanisms for in vitro complementation could be distinguished due to their different sensitivities to brefeldin A ( BFA ) .</sentence>
