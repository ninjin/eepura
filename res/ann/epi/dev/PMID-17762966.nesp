<sentence id="0">DNA stool test for colorectal cancer : hypermethylation of the secreted frizzled-related protein-1 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PURPOSE : To investigate a potential mode of noninvasive screening for colorectal cancer , we evaluated the hypermethylation of the secreted frizzled-related protein-1 gene promoter in human stool DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">METHODS : In stool samples from 36 patients with colorectal neoplasia ( 7 adenoma , 29 colorectal cancer ) and 17 healthy control subjects , isolated DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite and analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for methylated or unmethylated promoter sequences of the secreted frizzled-related protein-1 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">RESULTS : Hypermethylation of the secreted frizzled-related protein-1 promoter was present in the stool DNA of patients with adenoma and colorectal cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A sensitivity of 89 percent and specificity of 86 percent were achieved in the detection of colorectal neoplasia .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The difference in hypermethylation status of the secreted frizzled-related protein-1 promoter between the patients with colorectal neoplasia and the control group was statistically highly significant ( P < 0.001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Adenoma and early tumor Stage I ( International Union Against Cancer ) displayed both unmethylated and methylated secreted frizzled-related protein-1 promoter sequences , whereas advanced tumor stages showed only methylated secreted frizzled-related protein-1 ( P = 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">CONCLUSIONS : The results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> this DNA stool test of hypermethylation of the secreted frizzled-related protein-1 promoter is a sensitive and specific method</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It has the potential of a clinically useful test for the early detection of colorectal cancer .</sentence>
