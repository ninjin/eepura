<sentence id="0">Normal shear stress and vascular smooth muscle cells modulate migration of endothelial cells through histone deacetylase 6 activation and tubulin acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Endothelial cells ( ECs ) line the innermost of the blood vessel wall and are constantly subjected to shear stress imposed by blood flow .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">ECs were also influenced by the neighboring vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The bidirectional communication between ECs and VSMCs modulates vascular homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , the involvement of histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) in modulating migration of ECs co-cultured with VSMCs by the normal level of laminar shear stress ( NSS ) was investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">ECs was either cultured alone or co-cultured with VSMCs under static conditions or subjected to NSS of 15 dyne/cm2 by using a parallel-plate co-culture flow chamber system .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It was demonstrated that both NSS and VSMCs could increase EC migration .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The migration level of ECs co-cultured with VSMCs under NSS was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> higher than that under the static condition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The process of EC migration regulated by VSMCs and NSS was associated with the increased expression of HDAC6 and low level of acetylated tubulin .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The increase in HDAC6 expression was accompanied by a time-dependent decrease in the acetylation of tubulin in ECs co-cultured with VSMCs .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Inhibition of the HDAC6 by siRNA or tributyrin , an inhibitor of HDACs , induced a parallel alteration in the migration and the acetylated tubulin of ECs co-cultured with VSMCs .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">It was observed by immunofluorescence staining that the acetylated tubulin was distributed mostly around the cell nucleus in ECs co-cultured with VSMCs .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the NSS <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> display a protective function on the vascular homeostasis by modulating EC migration to a normal level in a VSMC-dependent manner</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">This modulation process involves the down-regulation of acetylated tubulin which results from increased HDAC6 activity in ECs .</sentence>
