<sentence id="0">Histone deacetylase 3 localizes to the mitotic spindle and is required for kinetochore-microtubule attachment .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein acetylation and deacetylation play key roles in multiple physiological functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Histone deacetylase 3 ( HDAC3 ) is a highly conserved , ubiquitously expressed protein that forms multiprotein corepressor complexes to repress gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recent studies show that HDAC3 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> play a role in cell proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Altered HDAC3 level increases G(2)/M cells , but the mechanism remains <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we show for the first time , to our knowledge , that the HDAC3 complex , including nuclear receptor corepressor ( N-CoR ) , transducin-beta-like protein 1 ( TBL1 ) , and TBL1-related protein 1 ( TBLR1 ) , is localized on the mitotic spindle .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Knockdown of HDAC3 or N-CoR resulted in a collapsed mitotic spindle that was surrounded by chromosomes arranged in a dome-like configuration .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Treatment of mitotic cells with Trichostatin A , an HDAC inhibitor , resulted in similar spindle defects independent of transcriptional regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , wild-type HDAC3 but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> a deacetylase-dead mutant HDAC3</scope> rescued the phenotypes of HDAC3-depleted cells , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that the enzymatic activity of HDAC3 is important for proper spindle function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Whereas the kinetochores and the spindle assembly checkpoint appeared intact in HDAC3-deficient cells , kinetochore-microtubule attachments were impaired because spindle microtubules were unstable in response to cold treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the HDAC3 complex is involved in the formation of functional mitotic spindles and proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="neg" id="5">The level or distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin was <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> altered in HDAC3-deficient cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Taken together , our studies raise the interesting possibility that acetylation-deacetylation of mitotic spindle components <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be essential for mitotic spindle function</scope> .</sentence>
