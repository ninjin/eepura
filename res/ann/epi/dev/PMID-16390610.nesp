<sentence id="0">Macroprolactin(s) : composition and reactivity in immunoassays and laboratory interpretation of results of an unusual patient serum .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Macroprolactin is a high molecular mass complex of prolactin that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be the cause of elevated serum prolactin as determined by immunoassay</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The composition of macroprolactin and its reactivity in immunoassays are variable but the complex has minimal bioactivity in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Hyperprolactinaemia due to unrecognized macroprolactinaemia <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">can</cue> lead to misdiagnosis and mistreatment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHODS : Serum from a patient with an unusual pattern of immunoreactivity was distributed to three users of each of the most popular immunoassays represented in the UK National External Quality Assessment Scheme ( NEQAS ) for prolactin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Clinical details were provided and participating centres were invited to investigate the prolactin content of the specimen according to their local protocol , and to comment on their results .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The nature of the macroprolactin in the specimen was investigated in detail by gel filtration chromatography of the native serum and of the serum after adsorption of IgG with protein A , and by affinity chromatography with concanavalin A .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RESULTS : Gel filtration studies revealed two peaks of macroprolactin in this serum .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These macroprolactins were shown to be different in their IgG content and degree of glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">All eight immunoassays reacted strongly with the macroprolactin present .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The majority ( 78 % ) of centres that interpreted their results either demonstrated the presence of macroprolactin in the specimen , or <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> it as a <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> cause of the hyperprolactinaemia</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , two centres inappropriately excluded macroprolactinaemia as the cause of the elevated prolactin , and a further two did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> consider it at all</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Data from previous UK NEQAS distributions ( between 1996 and 2003 ) of macroprolactin containing sera are presented which <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that the frequency of recognition of macroprolactin as a <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">possible</cue> cause of hyperprolactinaemia</scope> has increased over time</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSIONS : Very high molecular mass forms of prolactin and the presence of multiple molecular mass forms , as detected in the case presented here , are uncommon .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Also , the pattern of immunoreactivity reported in this specimen was unusual as most macroprolactins studied previously react less strongly in , for example , the Bayer ADVIA Centaur assay compared to the Roche E170 assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Both peaks of macroprolactin in this serum reacted in all assays tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">This case highlights the variable nature and immunoreactive behaviour of macroprolactin species .</sentence>
