T1003	Span 667 970	appears to be normal for the epidermal growth factor-1 exchange but considerably reduced for the construction containing both epidermal growth factor-like domains of factor X. The analysis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues reveals that all of the purified recombinants are almost fully carboxylated
