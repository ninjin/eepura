<sentence id="0">Structural requirements for the binding of modified proteins to the scavenger receptor of macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxidized low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and certain chemically modified LDL are recognized by the scavenger receptor of macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">All of these modifications involve charge-neutralizing derivatization of lysine amino groups .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , it remains controversial <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> recognition of modified LDL by this receptor is due to the modification per se , or to other factors such as a conformational change of apoB</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , LDL and other proteins including bovine serum albumin , human high density lipoprotein , and murine IgG were derivatized with oxidation products generated from arachidonic acid by thermal autoxidation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Modified proteins had increased negative charge , and showed a more than 10-fold enhancement of degradation by mouse peritoneal macrophages via the scavenger receptor pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Modification was prevented by blocking lysine residues of the proteins by prior reductive methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Amino acid analysis revealed dose-dependent modification of lysine residues with <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> significant effects on any other amino acid</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies specific for adducts of oxidation products with lysine prevented the uptake of oxidation product-modified LDL and oxidized LDL by macrophages .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Chromatography of oxidation product-modified LDL over Sepharose CL-4B showed that uptake by macrophages did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> require LDL aggregation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that a relatively simple domain consisting of a cluster of suitably derivatized lysine residues is sufficient for recognition by the scavenger receptor of macrophages</scope> .</sentence>
