<sentence id="0">Comparative methylation analysis of murine transgenes that undergo or escape X-chromosome inactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We analyzed an X-linked metallothionein-vasopressin ( MTVP ) fusion transgene that undergoes X-chromosome inactivation ( X inactivation ) and an X-linked transferrin ( TFN ) transgene that escapes X inactivation with respect to methylation in the 5' regulatory regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The MTVP transgene promoter region is unmethylated when the transgene is on the active X chromosome and methylated when on the inactive X chromosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Interestingly , <scope type="neg" id="0">the MTVP transgene is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detectably transcribed from the male X chromosome</scope> , although it is unmethylated , consistent with its availability for transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The TFN transgene promoter region is hypomethylated on both the active and inactive X chromosomes , consistent with its expression from both chromosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The TFN and MTVP transgenes have been mapped to chromosomal regions D and C , respectively , by fluorescence in situ hybridization .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These observations are discussed in the context of our understanding of the role of DNA methylation in the spread and maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation .</sentence>
