Multicenter evaluation of an investigational prostate cancer methylation assay. 
PURPOSE: Prostate specific antigen tests have low specificity, which frequently results in unnecessary biopsy and typically limits screening to patients with prostate specific antigen greater than 4.0 ng/ml. We evaluated an investigational prostate cancer methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay that detects aberrant methylation in 3 markers (GSTP1, RARbeta2 and APC) that indicate the presence of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The assay was evaluated in 337 post-digital rectal examination urine samples (178 cancer and 159 noncancer) collected prospectively at a total of 9 clinical sites. Samples were processed wholly or after division into equal portions. Subject prostate specific antigen was 2.0 to 10.0 ng/ml. All subjects underwent transrectal ultrasound guided needle biopsy with 6 or greater cores sampled. Detection of 1 or greater markers indicated positivity. RESULTS: Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay performance was better in whole than in divided urine cohorts (p = 0.035). Assay AUC was 0.72 in the whole urine cohort and 0.67 in the combined population. These values were higher than those of prostate specific antigen alone using 4.0 ng/ml as the cutoff (p = 0.00 and 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the assay together with the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator or a standard nomogram significantly improved AUC in the whole urine cohort and the combined population vs predictive algorithms alone (p <0.05). Assay positive predictive value was 54% in whole urine cohort with prostate specific antigen 2.0 to 4.0 ng/ml and negative predictive value was 87% with prostate specific antigen 4.1 to 10.0 ng/ml. Assay positive predictive value was higher in subjects with all 3 methylation markers positive. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that this investigational assay used in conjunction with current screening algorithms may potentially add value to the biopsy decision making process.
