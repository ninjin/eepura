<sentence id="0">Biochemical characterization of the vanilloid receptor 1 expressed in a dorsal root ganglia derived cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The vanilloid receptor VR1 is an ion channel predominantly expressed by primary sensory neurons involved in nociception .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we describe its biochemical properties and assess the subcellular localization , the glycosylation state and the quaternary structure of VR1 expressed in HEK293 cells and in the DRG-derived cell line F-11 ( N18TG2 mouse neuroblastoma x rat dorsal root ganglia , hybridoma ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">VR1 was found to be glycosylated in both cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Of the five <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> N-glycosylation sites</scope> , the predicted transient receptor potential channel-like transmembrane folding proposes N604 is localized extracellularly .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate the Asn at position 604 to Thr. This mutated VR1 was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> glycosylated , confirming the extracellular location of N604 and its role as the exclusive site of glycosylation of the VR1 protein</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">VR1 occured in high molecular mass complexes as assessed by blue native PAGE .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the presence of limited amounts of SDS dimers , trimers and tetramers of VR1 were observed , consistent with the predicted tetrameric quaternary structure of the receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Cross-linking with dimethyladipimidate yielded almost exclusively dimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Whereas VR1 localized both to the plasma membrane and to intracellular membranes in HEK293 cells , it localized predominantly to the plasma membrane in F-11 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Using confocal laserscanning microscopy , we observed an enrichment of anti-VR1 immunoreactivity in neurite-like structures of F-11 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In the light of conflicting literature data on biochemical characteristics of VR1 , our data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that dorsal root ganglion-derived F-11 cells provide a powerful experimental system for the study of VR1 biochemistry</scope> .</sentence>
