<sentence id="0">Chromatin-dependent regulation of the MMTV promoter by cAMP signaling is mediated through distinct pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The nucleoprotein structure of the mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) promoter defines its response to cAMP signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A stably replicating MMTV template in highly organized chromatin is repressed in the presence of cAMP , whereas a transiently transfected template with a disorganized structure is activated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we investigate the nature of the cAMP-induced signal(s) by which these opposing responses occur to gain insight into their mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We demonstrate that the transcriptional changes observed at both templates are mediated through cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , the MMTV promoter <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> a consensus cAMP response element ( CRE ) and neither template requires cAMP response element-binding protein ( CREB )</scope> to elicit a response to cAMP signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , <scope type="neg" id="1">the responses of the two templates differ mechanistically in that the CREB-binding protein p300 potentiates activation from the transient template in a manner dependent on its Cys/His-rich region 3 , but does <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to affect the repression of the replicating chromatin template</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that cAMP treatment results in a decrease in acetylation of histone H4 , and in multiple modifications of histone H3 at specific nucleosomes in the promoter region of the stable MMTV template .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> novel CREB-independent , chromatin-dependent pathways for transcriptional regulation by cAMP</scope> .</sentence>
