<sentence id="1">The comproportionation of ferrylhemoglobin with oxyhemoglobin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Ferrylhemoglobin ( X-FeIV-OH , where X denotes an amino acid residue in the globin moiety ) has long been <cue type="spec" id="0">suspected</cue> as a cytotoxic agent produced by the interaction of oxyhemoglobin ( X-FeIIO2 ) or methemoglobin ( X-FeIII ) with H2O2 in red blood cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To date , however , technical difficulties have prevented the identification and quantification of X-FeIV-OH .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Oxyhemoglobin exposed to a continuous flux of H2O2 ( generated at a rate of 120 microM/min during the glucose oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of glucose ) was oxidized to ( a ) X-FeIV-OH when [ X-FeIIO2 ] less than 75 microM and ( b ) X-FeIII when [ X-FeIIO2 ] greater than 75 microM ( the production of X-FeIII proceeded with intermediate formation of X-FeIV-OH ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The reduction of the X-FeIV-OH to X-FeIII could be explained by either of two alternative mechanisms : a O2(-)-mediated X-FeIV-OH---X-FeIII transition or a comproportionation of X-FeIV-OH and X-FeIIO2 to yield X-FeIII ( a process mediated by a tyrosine moiety in the hemoprotein ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The low rate of X-FeIIO2 autoxidation plus the negligible decrease in the rate of X-FeIII formation in the presence of either native or heat-denatured superoxide dismutase or apoenzyme ( 1 microM ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that O2- does not contribute to the reduction of X-FeIV-OH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , the dependence of X-FeIII formation on X-FeIIO2 concentration , together with the results of O2 uptake and H2O2 consumption measurements , provide experimental evidence to support the comproportionation reaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Comproportionation is apparently catalyzed by intermolecular electron transfer between tyrosine residues , since the reaction did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> occur when tyrosine residues were blocked by acetylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Intact red blood cells exposed to the same flow rate of H2O2 presented a spectral profile <scope type="spec" id="3"> which <cue type="spec" id="3">could</cue> be explained as a transition from X-FeIIO2 to X-FeIII</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The intermediate production of X-FeIV-OH was detected by adding Na2S ( 2 mM ) , which revealed a spectral profile identical with that obtained with purified X-FeIV-OH .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Measurements of concentrations and relative rate constants for the reaction of various intracellular reductants ( glutathione , NAD(P)H , uric acid , ascorbic acid ) with X-FeIV-OH revealed that comproportionation of X-FeIV-OH with X-FeIIO2 is the favored reaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our results provide ( to our knowledge ) the first definitive evidence for X-FeIV-OH in intact red blood cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The rapid comproportionation reaction between X-FeIV-OH and X-FeIIO2 ( to produce X-FeIII ) explains why X-FeIV-OH has been elusive to date .</sentence>
