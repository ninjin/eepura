<sentence id="0">Inhibition of histone deacetylase increases cytotoxicity to anticancer drugs targeting DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several anticancer drugs target DNA or enzymes acting on the DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because chromatin DNA is tightly compacted , accessibility to the drug target <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> reduce the efficiency of these anticancer drugs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We thus treated four human cancer cell lines and two normal epithelial cell lines with either trichostatin A ( TSA ) or SAHA , two histone deacetylase inhibitors , before exposing the cells to VP-16 , ellipticine , camptothecin , doxorubicin , cisplatin , 5-fluorouracil , or cyclophosmamide .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Pretreatment with TSA or SAHA increased the killing efficiency of VP-16 , ellipticine , doxorubicin , and cisplatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The magnitude of sensitization is cell type specific and is > 10-fold for VP-16 in D54 , a brain tumor cell line intrinsically resistant to topoisomerase II inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Topoisomerase II levels and activity were <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affected by this treatment</scope> , but p53 , p21 , and Gadd45 protein levels were markedly induced .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , pretreatment with TSA also increased VP-16-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent and -independent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Treating the cells in the reverse order ( anticancer drug first , followed by TSA or SAHA ) had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> more cytotoxic effect than the drug alone</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that loosening-up the chromatin structure by histone acetylation can increase the efficiency of several anticancer drugs targeting DNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be advantageous for treating tumors intrinsically resistant to these drugs</scope> .</sentence>
