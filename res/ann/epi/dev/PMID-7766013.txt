Production of vampire bat plasminogen activator DSPA alpha 1 in CHO and insect cells. 
Salivary plasminogen activator from the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus (DSPA alpha 1) is a promising new thrombolytic agent. Continuous growth of a stably transfected, methotrexate amplified, dhfr- CHO cell line yields up to 60 mg l-1 of DSPA alpha 1. Utilizing an engineered baculovirus 10 mg l-1 were produced in batches of Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant DSPA alpha 1 is purified from both sources using a one-step purification protocol. Although differences in glycosylation were detected, enzymatic activity and fibrin cofactor dependency are unaffected when DSPA alpha 1 derived from the two expression systems is compared.
