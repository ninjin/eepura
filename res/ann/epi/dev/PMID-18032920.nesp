<sentence id="0">Correlation of DNA methylation with histone modifications across the HNRPA2B1-CBX3 ubiquitously-acting chromatin open element ( UCOE ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The methylation-free CpG island encompassing the divergently transcribed promoters of the HNRPA2B1 and CBX3 housekeeping genes possesses a dominant ubiquitously-acting chromatin opening element ( UCOE ) capability .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This element allows reproducible and stable transgene expression including from within centromeric heterochromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We present an investigation of DNA methylation and histone modification marks across the HNRPA2B1-CBX3 locus in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) to characterise the chromatin structure that underlies UCOE activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The CpG methylation-free region associated with the UCOE extends into the central areas of HNRPA2B1 and CBX3 , with a total length of approximately 5 kb .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the DNA in the 3' half of both genes is methylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Histone H4 lysine ( K ) acetylation shows a broad distribution across both genes , whilst histone H3 lysine acetylation peaks around the transcriptional start sites and drops to background levels at the 3' ends .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Higher levels of H3K4 di-methylation are present at the 3' end of the genes in contrast to H3K4 tri-methylation which peaks around the transcriptional start sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , methylated DNA in transcribed regions of these genes has been shown here to co-exist with active histone modification marks , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> these functionally opposing epigenetic signatures can overlap</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that an extended large region of unmethylated DNA in combination with distinct histone modification patterns are at the basis of UCOE function</scope> .</sentence>
