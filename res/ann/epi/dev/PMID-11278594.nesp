<sentence id="1">Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 ( MIC-1 ) is a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) superfamily .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While it is synthesized in a pre-pro form , it is unique among superfamily members because it does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> require its propeptide for correct folding or secretion of the mature peptide</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate factors that enable these propeptide independent events to occur , we constructed MIC-1/TGF-beta1 chimeras , both with and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> a propeptide</scope> .</sentence>
