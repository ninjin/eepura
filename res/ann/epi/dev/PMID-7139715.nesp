<sentence id="0">Undermethylation at the 5' end of the albumin gene is necessary but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> sufficient for albumin production by rat hepatoma cells in culture</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have measured methylation of the albumin gene in clones of rat hepatoma cells that vary quantitatively in their rates of synthesis of albumin and in variant and hybrid cells that produce <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> albumin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although the albumin gene is undermethylated for its entire length in rat liver , only the 5' end is ever undermethylated in hepatoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , <scope type="spec" id="2"> undermethylation of the 5' end of the gene <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to be necessary for stable expression of the albumin gene in hepatoma cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Since undermethylation of this region is found in some variant cells that <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">fail</cue> to produce albumin</scope> , it is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> a sufficient condition for albumin gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Despite the excellent correlation between undermethylation of the 5' end of the albumin gene and its stable expression , the results argue against the <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">possibility</cue> that the methylated state of such genes during development determines</scope> <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">whether</cue> they will or will <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> be expressed</scope></scope> .</sentence>
