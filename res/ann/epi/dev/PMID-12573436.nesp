<sentence id="0">The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein : new insights into oxygen sensing and cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein ( pVHL ) is the substrate-recognition module of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) for degradation in the presence of oxygen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recognition of HIF by pVHL is linked to enzymatic hydroxylation of conserved prolyl residues in the HIF alpha subunits by members of the EGLN family .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Dysregulation of HIF-target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor alpha has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinomas and of hemangioblastomas , both of which frequently lack pVHL function .</sentence>
