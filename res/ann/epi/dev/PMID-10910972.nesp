<sentence id="0">Exploring the glycan repertoire of genetically modified mice by isolation and profiling of the major glycan classes and nano-NMR analysis of glycan mixtures .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The production of mice with genetic alterations in glycosyltransferases has highlighted the need to isolate and study complex mixtures of the major classes of oligosaccharides ( glycans ) from intact tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have found that nano-NMR spectroscopy of whole mixtures of N- and O-glycans can complement HPLC profiling methods for elucidating structural details .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Working toward obtaining such glycan mixtures from mouse tissues , we decided to develop an approach to isolate not only N- and O-glycans , but also to separate out glycosphingolipids , glycosaminoglycans and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We describe here a comprehensive Glycan Isolation Protocol that is based primarily upon the physicochemical characteristics of the molecules , and requires only commonly available reagents and equipment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using radiolabeled internal tracers , we show that recovery of each major class of glycans is as good or better than with conventional approaches for isolating individual classes , and that cross-contamination is minimal .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The recovered glycans are of sufficient purity to provide a " glycoprofile " of a cell type or tissue .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We applied this approach to compare the N- and O-glycans from wild type mouse tissues with those from mice genetically deficient in glycosyltransferases .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">N- and O-glycan mixtures from organs of mice deficient in ST6Gal-I ( CMP-Sia:Galbeta1-4GlcNAc alpha2-6 sialyltransferase ) were studied by the nano-NMR spectroscopy approach , showing no detectable alpha2-6-linked sialic acids .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , ST6Gal-I is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> responsible for generating most or all of these residues in normal mice</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Similar studies <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> this linkage is very rare in ganglioside glycans , even in wild-type tissues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In mice deficient in GalNAcT-8 ( UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide O-Ser/Thr GalNAc transferase 8 ) , HPLC profiling <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates that</cue> O-glycans persist in the thymus in large amounts , without a major change in overall profile , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that other enzymes can synthesize the GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr linkage in this tissue</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These results demonstrate the applicability of nano-NMR spectroscopy to complex glycan mixtures , as well as the versatility of the Glycan Isolation Protocol , which makes <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> the concurrent examination of multiple glycan classes from intact vertebrate tissues</scope> .</sentence>
