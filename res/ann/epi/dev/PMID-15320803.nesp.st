E1000	Speculation:T1000 Scope:T1001
T1001	Span 945 1159	possibly acts as an anti-DIC agent rather than an inhibitor of the protein C anticoagulant pathway under the pathophysiology of DIC, accompanied by the decrease in the thrombomodulin expression on endothelial cells
T1002	Speculation 923 935	hypothesized
E1001	Speculation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 923 1159	hypothesized that PCI possibly acts as an anti-DIC agent rather than an inhibitor of the protein C anticoagulant pathway under the pathophysiology of DIC, accompanied by the decrease in the thrombomodulin expression on endothelial cells
T1004	Speculation 1178 1187	suggested
E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1178 1390	suggested that PCI purified from human urine (uPCI) improves the pathophysiology of DIC through the inhibition of activities of plasma kallikrein and thrombin, and the activities of PCI are regulated by N-glycans
