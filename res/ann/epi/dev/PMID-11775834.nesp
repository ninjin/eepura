<sentence id="0">Molecular and immunohistochemical study of the inactivation of the p16 gene in primary hepatocellular carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> p16 gene is involved in the genesis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">METHODS : Twenty-five HCC tumor samples with corresponding non-tumor liver tissue specimens were examined for p16 gene alterations .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The identification of deletion of exon 1 and exon 2 in p16 gene was performed using comparative multiplex polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The point mutation of exon 2 in p16 gene was investigated by single strand conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis , and the status of p16 gene methylation was screened using a PCR based methylation analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">35 parafin-embedded specimens of HCC with corresponding non-tumor liver tissues , including the 25 cases described above for screening p16 gene alterations , were investigated for p16 protein expression using immunohistochemical analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">RESULTS</cue> : Among 25 cases , 2 homozygous deletions and 1 hemizygous deletion were found in HCC samples</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">No</cue> point mutation was identified in the remaining 22 tumor samples <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> p16 gene deletions</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Hypermethylation was detected in 24 % ( 6/25 ) of tumor samples .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , the corresponding non-tumor liver tissue specimens were always unmethylated at the p16 locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Loss of p16 protein expression occurred in 16 of 35 ( 45.7 % ) tumor samples , and all the non-tumor liver tissue specimens showed positive p16 staining .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">For the 25 cases examined for p16 gene alterations , the loss of p16 protein expression was observed in all tumors with p16 gene alterations and also in 3 tumors <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> p16 gene alterations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">CONCLUSION : Inactivation of the p16 gene <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> play an important role in the genesis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma</scope> .</sentence>
