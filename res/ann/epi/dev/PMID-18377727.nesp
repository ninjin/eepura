<sentence id="0">The novel gene LRP15 is regulated by DNA methylation and confers increased efficiency of DNA repair of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">LRP15 is a novel gene cloned from lymphocytic cells , and its function is still unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Bioinformatic data showed that <scope type="spec" id="0"> LRP15 <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> be regulated by DNA methylation</scope> and had an important role in DNA repair .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we investigate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the expression of LRP15 is regulated by DNA methylation , and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> overexpression of LRP15 increases efficiency of DNA repair of UV-induced DNA damage in HeLa cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The results showed ( 1 ) the promoter of LRP15 was hypermethylated in HeLa cells , resulting a silence of its expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Gene expression was restored by a demethylating agent , 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> by a histone deacetylase inhibitor , trichostatin A ; ( 2 ) overexpression of LRP15 inhibited HeLa cell proliferation , and the numbers of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in cells transfected with LRP15 increased about 10 % compared with controls ; ( 3 ) cyclin B1 level was much lower in cells overexpressing LRP15 than in control cells ; and ( 4 ) after exposure to UV radiation , the LRP15-positive cells showed shorter comet tails compared with the LRP15-negative cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">From these results we conclude that the expression of LRP15 is controlled by methylation in its promoter in HeLa cells , and LRP15 confers resistance to UV damage and accelerates the DNA repair rate .</sentence>
