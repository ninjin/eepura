<sentence id="0">Effect of modification of carbohydrate side chains on the reactivity of antibodies with core-protein epitopes of the MUC1 gene product .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The product of the MUC1 gene , the polymorphic epithelial mucin ( PEM ) , contains a large domain consisting of tandem repeats of 20 amino acids .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Each repeat contains five potential sites for O-glycosylation , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that this region forms a scaffold for the attachment of the O-linked carbohydrate which makes up more than 50 % of the molecule</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A number of monoclonal antibodies have been shown to recognize core-protein epitopes within the tandem repeat domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One such antibody , SM3 , reacts with the mucin expressed by breast carcinomas but shows little or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> reaction with normal resting or lactating breast</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using primary mammary epithelial cells ( HuME ) , an immortalized cell line derived from HuME ( MTSV1-7 ) and a breast carcinoma cell line ( BT20 ) the influence of the carbohydrate side chains on the binding of antibodies to core-protein epitopes has been investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We unequivocally show that the masking of the SM3 epitopes in normal breast epithelial cells is due to the carbohydrate side chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition we demonstrate that the binding of two other antibodies ( HMFG1 , HMFG2 ) to core-protein epitopes is influenced by the carbohydrate side chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The binding of HMFG-1 is particularly affected by sialic acid whereas the binding of HMFG2 is influenced by the length of the oligosaccharide side chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , inhibited <scope type="neg" id="2">elongation of O-linked carbohydrate side chains does <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">seem</cue> to interfere with the cell trafficking of the mucin to the cell surface</scope></scope> .</sentence>
