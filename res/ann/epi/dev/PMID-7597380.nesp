<sentence id="0">Glycosylation of IgG during <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> arthritogenic lentiviral infections</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Agalactosyl IgG [ Gal(0) ] was first discovered in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the proportion of this glycoform is also raised in tuberculosis and leprosy .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This has helped reinforce the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggestion</cue> that RA <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be triggered by a mycobacterium-like slow bacterial infection</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">On the other hand , arthritis can occur in mycobacterial diseases , so raised Gal(0) could be associated with a tendency to arthritis , rather than with a particular type of infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , we wished to find out <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> the percentage of Gal(0) [ % Gal(0) ] is increased in sheep and goats following infection with maedi visna virus or caprine arthritis encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) , both of which can lead to inflammatory synovitis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We found that the normal level of Gal(0) in these species is much lower than in humans .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Goats infected with CAEV or Mycobacterium paratuberculosis ( used as a control mycobacterial infection ) had a significant increase in % Gal(0) , though it was still below the level seen in normal humans .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Studies by Western blot confirmed the presence of terminal N-acetylglucosamine on heavy chains , and percentages of Gal(0) comparable to those seen in human RA could be generated by exposing goat IgG to streptococcal beta-galactosidase .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The rise in % Gal(0) was greatest in members of infected herds that were just starting to manifest arthritis , and tended to be lower in those in which severe carpitis had developed at the time of bleeding , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">implying</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possibility</cue> that raise % Gal(0) <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be an early or predisposing event for the development of arthritis</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
