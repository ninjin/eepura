<sentence id="0">Epigenetic regulation of telomere length in mammalian cells by the Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 histone methyltransferases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Telomeres are capping structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes composed of TTAGGG repeats bound to an array of specialized proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Telomeres are heterochromatic regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Yeast and flies with defects in activities that modify the state of chromatin also have abnormal telomere function , but the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> role of chromatin-modifying activities in regulating telomeres in mammals</scope> is unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we report on telomere length and function in mice null with respect to both the histone methyltransferases ( HMTases ) Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 ( called SUV39DN mice ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 govern methylation of histone H3 Lys9 ( H3-Lys9 ) in heterochromatic regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that primary cells derived from SUV39DN mice have abnormally long telomeres relative to wild-type controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) analysis , we found that telomeres were enriched in di- and trimethylated H3-Lys9 but that telomeres of SUV39DN cells had less dimethylated and trimethylated H3-Lys9 but more monomethylated H3-Lys9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Concomitant with the decrease in H3-Lys9 methylation , telomeres in SUV39DN cells had reduced binding of the chromobox proteins Cbx1 , Cbx3 and Cbx5 , homologs of Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate</cue> substantial changes in the state of telomeric heterochromatin in SUV39DN cells , which are associated with abnormal telomere elongation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Taken together , the results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate</cue> epigenetic regulation of telomere length in mammals by Suv39h1 and Suv39h2</scope> .</sentence>
