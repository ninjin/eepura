<sentence id="0">Phosphorylation of RTP , an ER stress-responsive cytoplasmic protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">RTP , also called Drg1/Cap43/rit42/TDD5/Ndr1 , was originally identified as a homocysteine-responsive gene product , and is now considered to be involved in stress responses , atherosclerosis , carcinogenesis , differentiation , androgen responses , hypoxia , and N-myc pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We raised an antiserum against a recombinant human RTP .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Western blot analysis showed that RTP expression was induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells under conditions causing endoplasmic reticulum stress .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RTP was partially phosphorylated at seven or more sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The phosphorylation was reversible , and was enhanced by an increased level of intracellular cAMP and inhibited by both a protein kinase A inhibitor and a calmodulin kinase inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Protein kinase A directly phosphorylated recombinant RTP in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The phosphorylated forms were abundant in cells at the early log phase , and then decreased with increasing cell density .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data demonstrated that RTP is a phosphorylated stress-responsive protein , and its phosphorylation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be related to cell growth</scope> .</sentence>
