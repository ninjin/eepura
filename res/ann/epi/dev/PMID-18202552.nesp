<sentence id="0">Yeast Chfr homologs retard cell cycle at G1 and G2/M via Ubc4 and Ubc13/Mms2-dependent ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Checkpoint with forkhead-associated and RING ( Chfr ) is a ubiquitin ligase ( E3 ) that establishes an antephase or prometaphase checkpoint in response to mitotic stress .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Though ubiquitination is essential for checkpoint function , the sites , linkages and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ( E2 ) specificity are controversial .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we dissect the function of the two Chfr homologs in S. cerevisiae , Chf1 and Chf2 , overexpression of which retard cell cycle at both G(1) and G(2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using a genetic assay , we establish that Ubc4 is required for Chf2-dependent G(1) cell cycle delay and Chf protein turnover .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , Ubc13/Mms2 is required for G(2) delay and does not contribute to Chf protein turnover .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By reconstituting cis and trans-ubiquitination activities of Chf proteins in purified systems and characterizing sites modified and linkages formed by tandem mass spectrometry , we discovered that Ubc13/Mms2- dependent modifications are a distinct subset of those catalyzed by Ubc4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Mutagenesis of Lys residues identified in vitro <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> site-specific Ubc4-dependent Chf protein autoubiquitination is responsible for Chf protein turnover</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , combined genetic and biochemical analyses <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> Chf proteins have dual E2 specificity accounting for different functions in the cell cycle</scope> .</sentence>
