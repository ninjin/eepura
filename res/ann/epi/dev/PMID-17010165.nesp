<sentence id="0">Interaction of HIV-1 with dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin-expressing cells is influenced by gp120 envelope modifications associated with disease progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Dendritic cells can enhance the replication of HIV-1 in CD4(+) lymphocytes through the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein with such molecules as dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The variable loops of gp120 have previously been shown to modulate the interaction of HIV-1 with its principal receptor CD4 and its various coreceptors , namely CCR5 and CXCR4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we utilized a panel of molecular cloned viruses to identify <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> gp120 modifications can influence the virus interaction with immature dendritic cells or a cell line expressing dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin ( Raji-DC-SIGN )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The viruses encompass the R5 , R5X4 and X4 phenotypes , and are based upon V1V2 and V3 sequences from a patient with disease progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin enhancement of virus replication can be modulated by the V1V2 length , the overall V3 charge and N-linked glycosylation patterns ; similar results were observed with immature dendritic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Viruses with higher V3 charges are more readily transferred to CD4(+) lymphocytes when the V1V2 region is longer and contains an additional N-linked glycosylation site , whereas transfer of viruses with lower V3 charges is greater when the V1V2 region is shorter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Viruses differing in the V1V2 and V3 regions also demonstrated differential capture by Raji-DC-SIGN cells in the presence of mannan .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the interaction between HIV-1 and immature dendritic cells via such molecules as dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> have a role in selecting viruses undergoing transmission and evolution during disease progression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
