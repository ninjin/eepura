<sentence id="0">Bile acid signaling pathways increase stability of Small Heterodimer Partner ( SHP ) by inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Small Heterodimer Partner ( SHP ) inhibits activities of numerous transcription factors involved in diverse biological pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As an important metabolic regulator , SHP plays a key role in maintaining cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis by inhibiting cholesterol conversion to bile acids .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While SHP gene induction by increased bile acids is well established , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> SHP activity is also modulated</scope> remains <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report surprising findings that SHP is a rapidly degraded protein via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and that bile acids or bile acid-induced intestinal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) increases stability of hepatic SHP by inhibiting proteasomal degradation in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">SHP was ubiquitinated at Lys122 and Lys123 , and mutation of these sites altered its stability and repression activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Tandem mass spectrometry revealed that upon bile acid treatment , SHP was phosphorylated at Ser26 , within an ERK motif in SHP , and mutation of this site dramatically abolished SHP stability .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Surprisingly , SHP stability was abnormally elevated in ob/ob mice and diet-induced obese mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results demonstrate an important role for regulation of SHP stability in bile acid signaling in normal conditions , and that <scope type="spec" id="2"> abnormal stabilization of SHP <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be associated with metabolic disorders , including obesity and diabetes</scope> .</sentence>
