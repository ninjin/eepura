Expression and characterization of human factor IX and factor IX-factor X chimeras in mouse C127 cells. 
Human blood clotting factor IX, and two chimeric molecules of factor IX, in which the first epidermal growth factor-like domain or both epidermal growth factor-like domains have been replaced by that of human factor X, have been expressed in mouse C127 cells. The recombinants have been purified using a metal ion-dependent monoclonal antibody specific for residues 1-42 of human factor IX. All recombinant molecules are activated normally by human factor XIa in the presence of calcium ion. Activation of the factor IX recombinants by factor VIIa-tissue factor appears to be normal for the epidermal growth factor-1 exchange but considerably reduced for the construction containing both epidermal growth factor-like domains of factor X. The analysis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues reveals that all of the purified recombinants are almost fully carboxylated. The extent of aspartic acid hydroxylation at residue 64 is 60% for all recombinants. The chimeric molecule with both epidermal growth factor-like domains from factor X has about 4% normal activity in the activated partial thromboplastin time assay. In contrast, the construct containing the first epidermal growth factor-like domain of factor X shows essentially normal clotting activity. Thus, it is unlikely that this domain is involved in a unique interaction with factor VIII.
