<sentence id="0">Reconstitution of the folding pathway of collagen in a cell-free system : formation of correctly aligned and hydroxylated triple helices .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We describe here a cell-free system which will carry out the initial stages in the synthesis , post-translational modification and assembly of type-X collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mRNA coding for bovine type-X collagen was synthesized in vitro and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate to yield a protein that was collagenase sensitive and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies raised to purified avian type-X collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">When type-X collagen was synthesized in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of added microsomes</scope> or in the presence of canine pancreas microsomes , the translation products showed partial resistance to digestion with pepsin but were completely degraded with a mixture of chymotrypsin and trypsin , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that only incorrectly aligned non-native collagen molecules were synthesized under these conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When the protein was synthesized in the presence of microsomes derived from avian fibroblasts or a human fibrosarcoma cell line , the translocated product migrated as a diffuse band characteristic of hydroxylated collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The synthesized polypeptides were also resistant to both pepsin and trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion , demonstrating the formation of correctly aligned native collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the collagen polypeptides assembled into higher-order structures , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibly</cue> trimers</scope> , which were stabilized by interchain disulphide bonds .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The collagen helix synthesized in vitro had a melting temperature of 41 degrees C which is comparable with the protein synthesized in vivo , further demonstrating that the polypeptides were hydroxylated and that the triple helix formed was correctly aligned .</sentence>
