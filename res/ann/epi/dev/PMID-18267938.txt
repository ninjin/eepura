Characterization of the molecular interaction between tropoelastin and DANCE/fibulin-5. 
Fibulin-5 is believed to play an important role in the elastic fiber formation. The present experiments were carried out to characterize the molecular interaction between fibulin-5 and tropoelastin. Our data showed that the divalent cations of Ca(2+), Ba(2+) and Mg(2+) significantly enhanced the binding of fibulin-5 to tropoelastin. In addition, N-linked glycosylation of fibulin-5 does not require for the binding to tropoelastin. To address the fibulin-5 binding site on tropoelastin constructs containing, exons 2-15 and exons 16-36, of tropoelastin were used. Fibulin-5 binding was significantly reduced to either fragment and also to a mixture of the two fragments. These results suggested that the whole molecule of tropoelastin was required for the interaction with fibulin-5. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, tropoelastin binding to fibulin-5 was enhanced by an increase of temperature and sodium chloride concentration, conditions that enhance the coacervation of tropoelastin. The binding of tropoelastin fragments to fibulin-5 was directly proportional to their propensity to coacervate. Furthermore, the addition of fibulin-5 to tropoelastin facilitated coacervation. Taken together, the present study shows that fibulin-5 enhances elastic fiber formation in part by improving the self-association properties of tropoelastin.
