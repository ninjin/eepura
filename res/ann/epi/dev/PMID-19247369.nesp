<sentence id="0">Hdm2 is a ubiquitin ligase of Ku70-Akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting Hdm2-dependent Ku70 destabilization .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Earlier , we have reported that 70 kDa subunit of Ku protein heterodimer ( Ku70 ) binds and inhibits Bax activity in the cytosol and that ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteolysis of cytosolic Ku70 facilitates Bax-mediated apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found that Hdm2 ( human homolog of murine double minute ) has an ability to ubiquitinate Ku70 and that Hdm2 overexpression in cultured cells causes a decrease in Ku70 expression levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An interaction between Ku70 and Hdm2 was shown by means of immunoprecipitation , whereas none could be shown between 80 kDa subunit of Ku protein heterodimer and Hdm2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is known to inhibit endothelial cell ( EC ) apoptosis through an Akt-mediated survival kinase signal ; however , <scope type="neg" id="0">the mechanism underlying this inhibition of apoptosis has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been fully elucidated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that VEGF inhibited cytosolic Ku70 degradation induced by apoptotic stress .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It is known that Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Hdm2 causes nuclear translocation of Hdm2 followed by Hdm2-mediated inactivation of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We found that VEGF stimulated nuclear translocation of Hdm2 in EC and efficiently inhibited Ku70 degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We also found that constitutively active Akt , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> kinase-dead Akt</scope> , inhibited Ku70 degradation in the cytosol .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , Ku70 knockdown diminished antiapoptotic activity of Akt. Taken together , we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> that Hdm2 is a Ku70 Ub ligase and that Akt inhibits Bax-mediated apoptosis , at least in part , by maintaining Ku70 levels through the promotion of Hdm2 nuclear translocation</scope> .</sentence>
