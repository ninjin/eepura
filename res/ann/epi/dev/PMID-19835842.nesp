<sentence id="0">Screening for OST deficiencies in unsolved CDG-I patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG ) are a group of inherited disorders caused by deficiencies in glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Since 1980 , 14 CDG type I ( CDG-I ) defects have been identified in the endoplasmic reticulum , all affecting the assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the number of unsolved CDG-I ( CDG-Ix ) patients displaying protein hypoglycosylation in combination with an apparently normal assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor is currently expanding .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="1"> the hypoglycosylation observed in some of these patients <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> be caused by a deficiency in the transfer of the oligosaccharide precursor onto protein , a reaction catalyzed by the oligosaccharyltransferase ( OST ) complex</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">For this purpose , the different subunits of the OST complex were screened in 27 CDG-Ix patients for whom structural analysis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides revealed a normal level and intact structure of the oligosaccharide precursor .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Among these 27 patients , one was identified with a homozygous missense mutation ( c.1121G>A ; p.G374D ) in the ribophorin 2 ( RPN2 ) subunit of the OST complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The pathogenic nature of this mutation remains unproven due to the complexity of tackling a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> OST defect</scope> .</sentence>
