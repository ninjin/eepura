<sentence id="0">Role of S3 and S4 transmembrane domain charged amino acids in channel biogenesis and gating of KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The role of positively charged arginines in the fourth transmembrane domain ( S4 ) and a single negatively charged amino acid in the third transmembrane domain ( S3 ) on channel biogenesis and gating of voltage-gated K(+) channels ( Kv ) has been well established .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Both intermediate ( KCa3.1 ) and small ( KCa2.x ) conductance , Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels have two conserved arginines in S4 and a single conserved glutamic acid in S3 , although these channels are voltage-independent .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate that mutation of any of these charged amino acids in KCa3.1 or KCa2.3 to alanine , glutamine , or charge reversal mutations results in a rapid degradation ( < 30 min ) of total protein , confirming the critical role of these amino acids in channel biogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutation of the S4 arginine closest to the cytosolic side of KCa3.1 to histidine resulted in expression at the cell surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Excised patch clamp experiments revealed that this Arg/His mutation had a dramatically reduced open probability ( P(o) ) , relative to wild type channels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , we demonstrate , using a combination of short hairpin RNA , dominant negative , and co-immunoprecipitation studies , that both KCa3.1 and KCa2.3 are translocated out of the endoplasmic reticulum associated with Derlin-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These misfolded channels are poly-ubiquitylated , recognized by p97 , and targeted for proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that S3 and S4 charged amino acids play an evolutionarily conserved role in the biogenesis and gating of KCa channels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , these improperly folded K(+) channels are translocated out of the endoplasmic reticulum in a Derlin-1- and p97-dependent fashion , poly-ubiquitylated , and targeted for proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
