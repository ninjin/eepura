<sentence id="0">Promoter hypermethylation profile of RASSF1A , FHIT , and sFRP1 in intracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Medulloblastomas ( MBs ) and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors ( SPNETs ) are histologically alike intracranial PNETs found in different anatomical locations of the brain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Current evidence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands is a common epigenetic event in a variety of human cancers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The aim of this study was to investigate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> promoter hypermethylation of <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> tumor suppressor genes</scope> was involved in both types of intracranial PNETs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We examined the methylation status at promoter regions of RASSF1A , FHIT , and sFRP1 by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in a cohort of 25 primary MBs , 9 primary SPNETs , and 3 MB and 2 SPNET cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results revealed <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A , FHIT , and sFRP1</scope> in 2 normal cerebellar and 5 normal cerebral tissue specimens examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected in 100 % of primary MBs , 67 % ( 6/9 ) of primary SPNETs , and all PNET cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The frequency of promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A was significantly lower in SPNETs than in MBs ( Fisher exact test , P = .014 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Treatment of RASSF1A-deficient PNET cell lines with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine , a demethylating agent , restored RASSF1A expression , providing evidence that promoter hypermethylation contributes to transcriptional silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , promoter hypermethylation of FHIT and sFRP1 was detected in 22 % ( 2/9 ) and 11 % ( 1/9 ) of SPNETs , respectively , but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> in any MBs studied</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In conclusion , our study demonstrates that promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A is a common event in intracranial PNETs , whereas FHIT and sFRP1 are epigenetically affected in a fraction of SPNETs .</sentence>
