<sentence id="0">Changes in the allelic methylation patterns of c-H-ras-1 , insulin and retinoblastoma genes in human development .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The methylation status of the c-H-ras-1 , insulin and retinoblastoma genes was determined in human sperm , hydatidiform mole , fetal tissues , adult lymphocytes and adult kidney .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Individual alleles of c-H-ras-1 and insulin were distinguishable due to presence of endogenous variable number of tandem repeat ( VNTR ) polymorphisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both alleles of the latter two genes were extensively methylated in sperm compared to the other tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Several sites within these genes were less methylated in fetal tissues and the two alleles were differentially methylated in some cases .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The retinoblastoma gene was highly methylated in all tissues examined , with the exception of a single site that was under-methylated in sperm only .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The sperm-specific methylation patterns in all three genes could represent imprinting of the parental chromosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Since 5-methylcytosine is inherently mutagenic , it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> that methylation imprinting <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> alter the susceptibilities of human genes to point mutations</scope></scope> .</sentence>
