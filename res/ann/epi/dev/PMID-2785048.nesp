<sentence id="0">Specific immune responses restored by alteration in carbohydrate chains of surface molecules on antigen-presenting cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Two class I major histocompatibility ( MHC ) mutant mouse strains , H-2bm14 and H-2bm6 , differ from the strain of origin C57BL/6 ( B6 , H-2b ) in one and two amino acids of the H-2Db and H-2Kb molecule , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The bm14 Db mutation results in specific failure of female bm14 mice to generate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( Tc ) response to the male-specific antigen H-Y .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The allospecific Tc response of CD8+ B6T cells against bm6 Kb mutant spleen cells , in contrast to that against other Kb mutants , is absolutely CD4+ T helper cell dependent .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Purified CD8+ T cells completely <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">fail</cue> to respond</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We now report that the inability to mount these specific immune responses is restored by the use of dendritic cells ( DC ) as antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Comparison of MHC expression on various types of APC by cytofluorimetry and quantitative immunoprecipitation showed very high expression of class I and class II MHC molecules on DC .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Strikingly , examination of class I and class II molecules by isoelectric focusing revealed qualitative differences as well .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We show that the surface MHC class I molecules of DC are present in greater quantity and carry on average fewer sialic acids than the same molecules isolated from other APC types such as spleen cells , lipopolysaccharide blasts or concanavalin A blasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="2"> That sialic acids on cell surface molecules , including MHC , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play a role in antigen presentation</scope> is <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> by our finding that removal of sialic acids , by neuraminidase , can restore specific responses to nonresponder APC as well</scope> .</sentence>
