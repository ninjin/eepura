<sentence id="0">Absence of ubiquitinated inclusions in hypocretin neurons of patients with narcolepsy .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVES : The cause of hypocretin cell loss in human narcolepsy-cataplexy is unknown but <scope type="spec" id="0"> has been <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> to be neurodegenerative in nature</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To test this hypothesis , we evaluated the remaining hypocretin cells in human narcolepsy brains for the presence of aggregated protein inclusions , gliosis , and inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : Brains were examined by routine histologic methods for potential comorbid neurodegenerative diseases and through immunohistochemical screening for protein inclusions in the hypothalamus .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Hypothalamic sections of 4 subjects with narcolepsy and 5 nonneurologic controls were examined immunohistochemically with antibodies against ubiquitin ( a marker of aggregated protein ) , allograft inflammatory factor 1 ( AIF1 , a microglial activation marker ) , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP , a reactive astrocytic marker ) , and hypocretin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hypothalami of subjects with narcolepsy were additionally examined for the presence of known components of protein aggregates ( tau , alpha-synuclein , amyloid beta , and TDP-43 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : Hypocretin cells were markedly decreased in all 4 subjects with narcolepsy .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="1">Ubiquitinated inclusions were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> observed in the total of 96 remaining hypocretin cells in these subjects</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Further , we noted that even in patients with dementia neuropathology , the lateral hypothalamic hypocretin area was spared from ubiquitinated inclusions .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">AIF1 and GFAP staining in the perifornical area was unremarkable .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSIONS : Our findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that hypocretin cell loss does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> involve ubiquitinated inclusions</scope> , the hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The lack of increased markers of inflammation also argues against a progressive and continuous neurodegenerative process .</sentence>
