Thrombophilic dysfibrinogen Tokyo V with the amino acid substitution of gammaAla327Thr: formation of fragile but fibrinolysis-resistant fibrin clots and its relevance to arterial thromboembolism. 
Thrombophilic dysfibrinogen Tokyo V was identified in a 43-year-old man with recurrent thromboembolism. Based on analyses of the patient fibrinogen genes, the amino acid sequence of the aberrant fibrinogen peptide, and deglycosylation experiments, fibrinogen Tokyo V was shown to have an amino acid substitution of gamma Ala327Thr and possibly extra glycosylation at gamma Asn325 because the mutation confers the N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence Asn-X-Thr. The mutation resulted in impaired function and hypofibrinogenemia (hypodysfibrinogen). Polymerization of fibrin monomers derived from patient fibrinogen was severely impaired with a partial correction in the presence of calcium, resulting in very low clottability. Additionally, a large amount of soluble cross-linked fibrin was formed upon thrombin treatment in the presence of factor XIII and calcium. However, Tokyo V-derived fibrin was resistant to degradation by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-catalyzed plasmin digestion. The structure of Tokyo V fibrin appeared severely perturbed, since there are large pores inside the tangled fibrin networks and fiber ends at the boundaries. Taken together, these data suggest that Tokyo V fibrin clots are fragile, so that fibrinolysis-resistant insoluble fibrin and soluble fibrin polymers may be released to the circulation, partly accounting for the recurrent embolic episodes in the patient.
