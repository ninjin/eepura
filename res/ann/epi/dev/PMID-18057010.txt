Cdc42 regulates E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation through an epidermal growth factor receptor to Src-mediated pathway. 
E-cadherins play an essential role in maintaining epithelial polarity by forming Ca2+-dependent adherens junctions between epithelial cells. Here, we report that Ca2+ depletion induces E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation and that Cdc42 plays an important role in regulating this process. We demonstrate that Ca2+ depletion induces activation of Cdc42. This in turn up-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to mediate Src activation, leading to E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Silencing Cdc42 blocks activation of EGFR and Src induced by Ca2+ depletion, resulting in a reduction in E-cadherin degradation. The role of Cdc42 in regulating E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation is underscored by the fact that constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) increases the activity of EGFR and Src and significantly enhances E-cadherin ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, we found that GTP-dependent binding of Cdc42 to E-cadherin is critical for Cdc42 to induce the dissolution of adherens junctions. Our data support a model that activation of Cdc42 contributes to mesenchyme-like phenotype by targeting of E-cadherin for lysosomal degradation.
