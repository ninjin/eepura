<sentence id="0">A histone map of human chromosome 20q13.12 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : We present a systematic search for regulatory elements in a 3.5 Mb region on human chromosome 20q13.12 , a region associated with a number of medical conditions such as type II diabetes and obesity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : We profiled six histone modifications alongside RNA polymerase II ( PolII ) and CTCF in two cell lines , HeLa S3 and NTERA-2 clone D1 ( NT2/D1 ) , by chromatin immunoprecipitation using an in-house spotted DNA array , constructed with 1.8 kb overlapping plasmid clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In both cells , more than 90 % of transcription start sites ( TSSs ) of expressed genes showed enrichments with PolII , di-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 ( H3K4me2 ) , tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 ( H3K4me3 ) or acetylated H3 ( H3Ac ) , whereas mono-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 ( H3K4me1 ) signals did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> correlate with expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">No</cue> TSSs were enriched with tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27me3 ) in HeLa S3</scope> , while eight TSSs ( 4 expressed ) showed enrichments in NT2/D1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have also located several CTCF binding sites that are potential insulator elements .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : In summary , we annotated a number of <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> regulatory elements in 20q13.12</scope> and went on to verify experimentally a subset of them using dual luciferase reporter assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Correlating this data to sequence variation can aid identification of disease causing variants .</sentence>
