<sentence id="0">Many amino acid substitutions in a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1alpha-like peptide cause only minor changes in its hydroxylation by the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases : substitution of 3,4-dehydroproline or azetidine-2-carboxylic acid for the proline leads to a high rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Three human prolyl 4-hydroxylases ( P4Hs ) regulate the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors ( HIFs ) by hydroxylating a Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Pro motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report here that the two leucines in the Leu-Glu-Met-Leu-Ala-Pro core motif of a 20-residue peptide corresponding to the sequence around Pro(564) in HIF-1alpha can be replaced by many residues with <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> or only a modest decrease in its substrate properties or in some cases even a slight increase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The glutamate and methionine could be substituted by almost any residue , eight amino acids in the former position and four in the latter being even better for HIF-P4H-3 than the wild-type residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Alanine was by far the strictest requirement , because <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> residue could fully substitute for it in the case of HIF-P4H-1</scope> , and only serine or isoleucine , valine , and serine did this in the cases of HIF-P4Hs 2 and 3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Peptides with more than one substitution , having the core sequences Trp-Glu-Met-Val-Ala-Pro , Tyr-Glu-Met-Ile-Ala-Pro , Ile-Glu-Met-Ile-Ala-Pro , Trp-Glu-Met-Val-Ser-Pro , and Trp-Glu-Ala-Val-Ser-Pro were in most cases equally as good or almost as good substrates as the wild-type peptide .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The acidic residues present in the 20-residue peptide also played a distinct role , but alanine substitution for any six of them , and in some combinations even three of them , had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> negative effects</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Substitution of the proline by 3,4-dehydroproline or l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> any other residue</scope> , led to a high rate of uncoupled 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation with <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> hydroxylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The data obtained for the three HIF-P4Hs in various experiments were in most cases similar , but in some cases HIF-P4H-3 showed distinctly different properties .</sentence>
