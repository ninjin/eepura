<sentence id="0">MdmX is a substrate for the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It has previously been shown that ubiquitin-specific protease 2a ( USP2a ) is a regulator of the Mdm2/p53 pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">USP2a binds to Mdm2 and can deubiquitinate Mdm2 <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> reversing Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Overexpression of USP2a causes accumulation of Mdm2 and promotes p53 degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We now show that MdmX is also a substrate for USP2a .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">MdmX associates with USP2a independently of Mdm2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Ectopic expression of wild-type USP2a but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> a catalytic mutant</scope> prevents Mdm2-mediated degradation of MdmX .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This correlates with the ability of wild-type USP2a to deubiquitinate MdmX .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP2a in NTERA-2 testicular embryonal carcinoma cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells causes destabilization of MdmX and results in a decrease in MdmX protein levels , showing that endogenous USP2a participates in the regulation of MdmX stability .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The therapeutic drug , cisplatin decreases MdmX protein expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">USP2a mRNA and protein levels were also reduced after cisplatin exposure .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The magnitude and time course of USP2a downregulation <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that the reduction in USP2a levels <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">could</cue> contribute to the decrease in MdmX expression following treatment with cisplatin</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Knockdown of USP2a increases the sensitivity of NTERA-2 cells to cisplatin , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">raising the</cue> possibility that suppression of USP2a in combination with cisplatin <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be an approach for cancer therapy</scope></scope> .</sentence>
