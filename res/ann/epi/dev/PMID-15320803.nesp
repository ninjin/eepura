<sentence id="0">Protein C inhibitor as an anti-disseminated intravascular coagulation agent--mechanism and modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Gram-negative sepsis is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) due to endothelial damage , which is induced by inflammatory mediators released from phagocytes activated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">DIC is a systemic hemorrhagic syndrome , which results from the consumption of coagulation factors for the formation of multiple thrombi in the systemic microvessels ; it is associated with multiple organ failure .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Therefore , not only the systemic activation of coagulation but also the inflammatory response has been perceived as the therapeutic target for DIC in sepsis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We gave attention that protein C inhibitor ( PCI ) acts as an inhibitor of both plasma kallikrein and thrombin , which are known to act not only as procoagulant proteases but also as chemotactic factors toward phagocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Then , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that PCI <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> acts as an anti-DIC agent rather than an inhibitor of the protein C anticoagulant pathway under the pathophysiology of DIC , accompanied by the decrease in the thrombomodulin expression on endothelial cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our studies have <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that PCI purified from human urine ( uPCI ) improves the pathophysiology of DIC through the inhibition of activities of plasma kallikrein and thrombin , and the activities of PCI are regulated by N-glycans</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This review introduces the anti-DIC action of PCI and about the modification of N-glycosylation site(s) of PCI to heighten the value of PCI as an anti-DIC agent .</sentence>
