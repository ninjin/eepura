<sentence id="0">The Yng1p plant homeodomain finger is a methyl-histone binding module that recognizes lysine 4-methylated histone H3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The ING ( inhibitor of growth ) protein family includes a group of homologous nuclear proteins that share a highly conserved plant homeodomain ( PHD ) finger domain at their carboxyl termini .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Members of this family are found in multiprotein complexes that posttranslationally modify histones , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that these proteins serve a general role in permitting various enzymatic activities to interact with nucleosomes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">There are three members of the ING family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae : Yng1p , Yng2p , and Pho23p .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Yng1p is a component of the NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex and is required for the interaction of NuA3 with chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To gain insight into the function of the ING proteins , we made use of a genetic strategy to identify genes required for the binding of Yng1p to histones .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using the toxicity of YNG1 overexpression as a tool , we showed that Yng1p interacts with the amino-terminal tail of histone H3 and that this interaction can be disrupted by loss of lysine 4 methylation within this tail .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Additionally , we mapped the region of Yng1p required for overexpression of toxicity to the PHD finger , showed that this region capable of binding lysine 4-methylated histone H3 in vitro , and demonstrated that mutations of the PHD finger that abolish binding in vitro are no longer toxic in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results identify a novel function for the Yng1p PHD finger in promoting stabilization of the NuA3 complex at chromatin through recognition of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation .</sentence>
