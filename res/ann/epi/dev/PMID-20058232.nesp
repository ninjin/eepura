<sentence id="0">The 19S proteasomal lid subunit POH1 enhances the transcriptional activation by Mitf in osteoclasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( Mitf ) regulates gene expression required for osteoclast differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Genes regulated by Mitf have been previously identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , <scope type="neg" id="0">proteins that interact and regulate Mitf 's activity in osteoclasts are <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> well known</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report that POH1 , a subunit of the 19S proteasome lid is a regulator of Mitf .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that POH1 and Mitf interact in osteoclasts and that this interaction is dependent on RANKL signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Overexpression of POH1 increased Mitf 's activation of 5XGal4-TK and Acp5 promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The amino terminus of POH1 mediates the binding to Mitf and is sufficient to increase Mitf 's transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , we show that mutations in the JAMM motif of POH1 reduced Mitf activation of promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In summary , our results identify a novel mechanism of Mitf regulation in osteoclasts by POH1 .</sentence>
