<sentence id="0">Changes in liver and plasma acetylcholinesterase in rats with cirrhosis induced by bile duct ligation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Classical studies of cholinesterase activity during liver dysfunction have focused on butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) , whereas acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> received much attention</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the current study , liver and plasma AChE levels were investigated in rats with cirrhosis induced after 3 weeks of bile duct ligation ( BDL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">BDL rats showed a pronounced decrease in liver AChE levels ( approximately 50 % ) compared with sham-operated ( non-ligated , NL ) controls ; whereas liver BuChE appeared unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A selective loss of tetrameric ( G4 ) AChE was detected in BDL rats , an effect also observed in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In accordance , SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the major 55-kd immunoreactive AChE band was decreased in BDL as compared with NL .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A 65-kd band , attributed in part to inactive AChE , was increased as became the most abundant AChE subunit in BDL liver .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="1">The overall decrease in AChE activity in BDL liver was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> accompanied by a reduction of AChE transcripts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The loss of G4 was also reflected by changes observed in AChE glycosylation pattern attributable to different liver AChE forms being differentially glycosylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">BDL affects AChE levels in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells ; however , altered AChE expression was mainly reflected in an alteration in hepatocyte AChE pattern .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Plasma from BDL rats had approximately 45 % lower AChE activity than controls , displaying decreased G4 levels and altered lectin-binding patterns .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In conclusion , the liver is an important source of serum AChE ; altered AChE levels <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be a useful biomarker for liver cirrhosis</scope> .</sentence>
