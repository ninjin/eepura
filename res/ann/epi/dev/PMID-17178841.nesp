<sentence id="0">Knockdown of ALR ( MLL2 ) reveals ALR target genes and leads to alterations in cell adhesion and growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">ALR ( MLL2 ) is a member of the human MLL family , which belongs to a larger SET1 family of histone methyltransferases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found that ALR is present within a stable multiprotein complex containing a cohort of proteins shared with other SET1 family complexes and several unique components , such as PTIP and the jumonji family member UTX .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Like other complexes formed by SET1 family members , the ALR complex exhibited strong H3K4 methyltransferase activity , conferred by the ALR SET domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By generating ALR knockdown cell lines and comparing their expression profiles to that of control cells , we identified a set of genes whose expression is activated by ALR .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Some of these genes were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation as direct ALR targets .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The ALR complex was found to associate in an ALR-dependent fashion with promoters and transcription initiation sites of target genes and to induce H3K4 trimethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The most characteristic features of the ALR knockdown cells were changes in the dynamics and mode of cell spreading/polarization , reduced migration capacity , impaired anchorage-dependent and -independent growth , and decreased tumorigenicity in mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that ALR is a transcriptional activator that induces the transcription of target genes by covalent histone modification</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="1"> ALR <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to be involved in the regulation of adhesion-related cytoskeletal events , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> affect cell growth and survival</scope></scope> .</sentence>
