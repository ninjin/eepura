<sentence id="0">Proline hydroxylation and gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is a master transcriptional regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes and consists of a labile alpha subunit ( such as HIF1alpha ) and a stable beta subunit ( such as HIF1beta or ARNT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the presence of oxygen , HIFalpha family members are hydroxylated on one of two conserved prolyl residues by members of the egg-laying-defective nine ( EGLN ) family .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Prolyl hydroxylation generates a binding site for a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) tumor suppressor protein , which results in HIFalpha destruction .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , the HIFalpha transcriptional activation function is modulated further by asparagine hydroxylation by FIH ( factor-inhibiting HIF ) , which affects recruitment of the coactivators p300 and CBP .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These findings provide new mechanistic insights into oxygen sensing by metazoans and are the first examples of protein hydroxylation being used in intracellular signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The existence of three human EGLN family members , as well as other <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> hydroxylases</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">raises the</cue> possibility that this signal is used in other contexts by other proteins</scope> .</sentence>
