Production and secretion of high levels of recombinant human acetylcholinesterase in cultured cell lines: microheterogeneity of the catalytic subunit. 
To allow for structural analysis of the human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) subunit, a series of eukaryotic vectors was designed for efficient expression. Several eukaryotic multicistronic expression vectors were tested in various mammalian cell lines. All expression vectors contained the selectable neo gene under control of a weak promoter, while the hAChE cDNA was under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early or Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR) or simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoters. Optimal production and secretion of recombinant hAChE (rehAChE) was achieved in the embryonal kidney 293 cell line transfected either with the RSV-hAChE or with CMV-hAChE expression vectors. Clones expressing and secreting as much as 5-25 pg of enzyme per cell per 24 h were obtained without resorting to coamplification techniques or continuous maintenance of cells under selective pressure. The purified (specific activity of 6000 units per mg protein) homodimer and tetramer enzyme molecules displayed typical AChE biochemical properties: a Km value of 120 microM for acetylthiocholine; a kcat value of 3.9 x 10(5)/min, and selective by AChE-specific inhibitors. Catalytic subunit dimers (130 kDa) exhibit differential N-glycosylation patterns, and upon reduction resolve into 67- and 70-kDa monomeric subunits. These two forms appear as a single discrete 62-kDa band following deglycosylation by N-glycanase. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified mature enzyme suggests the existence of two alternative cleavage sites for the removal of the signal peptide, in which the 'mature' position 1 is either Ala31 or Gly33. Both of these positions conform with the consensus signal peptide recognition sequences and demonstrate bidirected processing of signal peptides on a native molecule.
