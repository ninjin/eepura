<sentence id="0">Cytosine methylation represses glutathione S-transferase P1 ( GSTP1 ) gene expression in human prostate cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of the glutathione S-transferase P1 ( GSTP1 ) gene has been described as a highly specific and sensitive biomarker for prostate cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , at present , it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">not known</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> methylation represses GSTP1 gene expression in human prostate cancer</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found the GSTP1 gene promoter to be completely methylated in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line , where this gene is transcriptionally inactive .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , Du145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells express the GSTP1 gene and exhibit methylated and unmethylated GSTP1 alleles .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In a transient transfection assay using LNCaP cells , methylation of the GSTP1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector ( GSTP1-pGL3 ) resulted in a > 20-fold inhibition of transcription , and <scope type="neg" id="2">this repression was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> relieved by the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor , trichostatin A ( TSA )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Treatment of LNCaP cells with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor , 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine , resulted in demethylation and activation of the GSTP1 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , TSA treatment <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">failed</cue> to demethylate or activate the GSTP1 gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Fully methylated but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> unmethylated GSTP1 promoter fragment was shown to bind to a complex similar to methyl cytosine-binding protein complex 1 that contains methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 protein ( MBD2 ) in electrophoretic mobility shift assays using LNCaP cell nuclear extracts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data demonstrate that cytosine methylation can repress GSTP1 gene expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and that this effect is <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possibly</cue> mediated by a methyl cytosine-binding protein complex 1-like complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , these data also support the <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">notion</cue> of the dominance of methylation over TSA-sensitive histone deacetylation in silencing genes with a high CpG density in the promoter region</scope> .</sentence>
