<sentence id="0">NF-kappaB activation upregulates fibroblast growth factor 8 expression in prostate cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Fibroblast growth factor 8 ( FGF8 ) is over-expressed in prostate cancer ( CaP ) correlating with high-grade disease and reduced survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The role of acetylation in transcriptional regulation of FGF8 was investigated using the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor Trichostatin A ( TSA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : FGF8 transcriptional response to TSA was investigated by gene reporter assays , RT-PCR , and Western blotting .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays were also performed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RESULTS : FGF8 is upregulated in response to TSA treatment along with NF-kappaB transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Over-expression of p65 activated FGF8 transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">ChIP assays revealed p65 recruitment to the fgf8 promoter , containing <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> NF-kappaB binding sites</scope> , post TSA stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">PI-3K activity is required for TSA mediated FGF8 upregulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSION : Using TSA treatment in prostate cancer cells , a requirement of PI-3K activity in mediating TSA function is demonstrated and a novel role for NF-kappaB in the regulation of FGF8 expression is uncovered .</sentence>
