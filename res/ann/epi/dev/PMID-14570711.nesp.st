T1001	Span 853 1034	suggest that this pattern of promoter restricted H3 Lys 4 di-methylation, already present in totipotent cells, is causally related to the long-term programming of allelic expression

T1003	Span 291 444	the effect of this modification is likely also to depend on its distribution both within the euchromatic region and more specifically within a given gene
