<sentence id="0">Identification of the ZPC oligosaccharide ligand involved in sperm binding and the glycan structures of Xenopus laevis vitelline envelope glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Xenopus laevis egg vitelline envelope is composed of five glycoproteins ( ZPA , ZPB , ZPC , ZPD , and ZPX ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As shown previously , ZPC is the primary ligand for sperm binding to the egg envelope , and this binding involves the oligosaccharide moieties of the glycoprotein ( Biol. Reprod. , 62:766-774 , 2000 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To understand the molecular mechanism of sperm-egg envelope binding , we characterized the N-linked glycans of the vitelline envelope ( VE ) glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The N-linked glycans of the VE were composed predominantly of a heterogeneous mixture of high-mannose ( 5-9 ) and neutral , complex oligosaccharides primarily derived from ZPC ( the dominant glycoprotein ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the ZPA N-linked glycans were composed of acidic-complex and high-mannose oligosaccharides , ZPX had only high-mannose oligosaccharides , and ZPB <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacked</cue> N-linked oligosaccharides</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation at the evolutionarily conserved residue N113 of the ZPC protein sequence was glycosylated solely with high-mannose oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This conserved glycosylation site <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be of importance to the three-dimensional structure of the ZPC glycoproteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">One of the complex oligosaccharides of ZPC possessed terminal beta-N-acetyl-glucosamine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The same ZPC oligosaccharide species isolated from the activated egg envelopes <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacked</cue> terminal beta-N-acetyl-glucosamine residues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We previously showed that the cortical granules contain beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase ( J. Exp. Zool. , 235:335-340 , 1985 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that an alteration in the oligosaccharide structure of ZPC by glucosaminidase released from the cortical granule reaction is responsible for the loss of sperm binding ligand activity at fertilization</scope> .</sentence>
