<sentence id="0">Role of glycosylation in the organic anion transporter OAT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Organic anion transporters ( OAT ) play essential roles in the body disposition of clinically important anionic drugs , including antiviral drugs , antitumor drugs , antibiotics , antihypertensives , and anti-inflammatories .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We reported previously ( Kuze , K. , Graves , P. , Leahy , A. , Wilson , P. , Stuhlmann , H. , and You , G. ( 1999 ) J. Biol. Chem. 274 , 1519-1524 ) that tunicamycin , an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation , significantly inhibited organic anion transport in COS-7 cells expressing a mouse organic anion transporter ( mOAT1 ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> an important role of glycosylation in mOAT1 function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study , we investigated the effect of disrupting <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> glycosylation sites</scope> in mOAT1 as well as its human counterpart , hOAT1 , by mutating asparagine to glutamine and assessing mutant transporters in HeLa cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We showed that <scope type="neg" id="2">the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">putative</cue> glycosylation site Asp-39 in mOAT1</scope> was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> glycosylated</scope> but the corresponding site ( Asp-39 ) in hOAT1 was glycosylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Disrupting Asp-39 resulted in a complete loss of transport activity in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> affecting their cell surface expression</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggesting</cue> that the loss of function is <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> because of deglycosylation of Asp-39 per se but rather is <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">likely</cue> because of the change of this important amino acid critically involved in the substrate binding</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Single replacement of asparagines at other sites had <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">no</cue> effect on transport activity <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">indicating that</cue> glycosylation at individual sites is <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> essential for OAT function</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , a simultaneous replacement of all asparagines in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 impaired the trafficking of the transporters to the plasma membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In summary , we provided <scope type="neg" id="11">the evidence that 1 ) Asp-39 is crucially involved in substrate recognition of OAT1 , 2 ) glycosylation at individual sites is <cue type="neg" id="11">not</cue> required for OAT1 function</scope> , and 3 ) glycosylation plays an important role in the targeting of OAT1 onto the plasma membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This study is the first molecular identification and characterization of glycosylation of OAT1 and <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">may</cue> provide important insights into the structure-function relationships of the organic anion transporter family</scope> .</sentence>
