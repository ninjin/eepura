<sentence id="0">Arginine methylation analysis of the splicing-associated SR protein SFRS9/SRP30C .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human SFRS9/SRp30c belongs to the SR family of splicing regulators .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Despite evidence that members of this protein family <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be targeted by arginine methylation</scope> , this has yet to be experimentally addressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we found that SFRS9 is a target for PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation in vitro , and that it is immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 lysates by antibodies that recognize both mono- and dimethylated arginines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We further observed that upon treatment with the methylation inhibitor Adox , the fluorescent EGFP-SFRS9 re-localizes to dot-like structures in the cell nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In subsequent confocal analyses , we found that EGFP-SFRS9 localizes to nucleoli in Adox-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate</cue> the importance of arginine methylation for the subnuclear localization of SFRS9</scope> .</sentence>
