<sentence id="0">Fusing the carboxy-terminal peptide of the chorionic gonadotropin ( CG ) beta-subunit to the common alpha-subunit : retention of O-linked glycosylation and enhanced in vivo bioactivity of chimeric human CG .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The hCG beta-subunit contains a carboxy-terminal extension bearing four serine-linked oligosaccharides [ carboxy-terminal peptide ( CTP ) ] , which is important for maintaining its longer half-life compared with the other glycoprotein hormones .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previously , we enhanced the in vivo half-life of FSH by fusing the CTP to the carboxy end of FSH beta coding sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The alpha-subunit is common to the glycoprotein family .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We constructed alpha-subunit CTP chimeras , since such analogs with the appropriate O-linked glycosylation and conformation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">would</cue> increase the in vivo stability of the entire glycoprotein hormone family</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Two chimeras were constructed using overlapping polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis : a variant with CTP at the carboxy end and another analog with the CTP at the N-terminal region of the subunit , between amino acids 3 and 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The latter design was based on models showing that the amino-terminal region of alpha is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> involved in assembly with the beta-subunit , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">nor</cue> is it essential for receptor binding and signal transduction</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These chimeras were cotransfected with the hCG beta gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The chimeras were secreted and combined efficiently with the CG beta-subunit , comparable to the wild type alpha-subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CG dimers containing the alpha-subunit chimera with CTP at the carboxy end of the subunit had a much lower binding affinity for the hLH-hCG receptor in vitro , whereas the binding of the dimer containing the CTP at the amino-terminal end of the subunit was similar to wild type hCG .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , the in vivo activity of this analog was enhanced significantly .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Moreover , regardless of the two insertion points in the alpha-subunit , the CTP sequence was O-glycosylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the entire signal for O-glycosylation is primarily contained within the CTP sequence and is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> dependent on the flanking regions of the recipient protein</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The transfer of CTP to the alpha-subunit of hCG results in an agonist with prolonged biological action in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">These data further support the rationale for using the CTP as a general target to increase the potency of bioactive glycoproteins .</sentence>
