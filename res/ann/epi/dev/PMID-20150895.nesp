<sentence id="0">Tonic ubiquitylation controls T-cell receptor:CD3 complex expression during T-cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR):CD3 complex is tightly regulated during T-cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mechanism and physiological role of this regulation are <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that the TCR:CD3 complex is constitutively ubiquitylated in immature double positive ( DP ) thymocytes , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> mature single positive ( SP ) thymocytes or splenic T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This steady state , tonic CD3 monoubiquitylation is mediated by the CD3varepsilon proline-rich sequence , Lck , c-Cbl , and SLAP , which collectively trigger the dynamin-dependent downmodulation , lysosomal sequestration and degradation of surface TCR:CD3 complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Blocking this tonic ubiquitylation by mutating all the lysines in the CD3 cytoplasmic tails significantly upregulates TCR levels on DP thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mimicking monoubiquitylation by expression of a CD3zeta-monoubiquitin ( monoUb ) fusion molecule significantly reduces TCR levels on immature thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , modulating CD3 ubiquitylation alters immunological synapse ( IS ) formation and Erk phosphorylation , thereby shifting the signalling threshold for positive and negative selection , and regulatory T-cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , tonic TCR:CD3 ubiquitylation results in precise regulation of TCR expression on immature T cells , which is required to maintain the fidelity of T-cell development .</sentence>
