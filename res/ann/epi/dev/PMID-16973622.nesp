<sentence id="0">Clioquinol , a Cu(II)/Zn(II) chelator , inhibits both ubiquitination and asparagine hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha , leading to expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin in normoxic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We found that the Cu(II) and Zn(II)-specific chelator Clioquinol ( 10-50 microM ) increased functional hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) protein , leading to increased expression of its target genes , vascular endothelial growth factors and erythropoietin , in SH-SY5Y cells and HepG2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Clioquinol inhibited ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha in a Cu(II)- and Zn(II)-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It prevents FIH-1 from hydroxylating the asparagine residue ( 803 ) of HIF-1alpha in a Cu(II)- and Zn(II)-independent fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Therefore , it leads to the accumulation of HIF-1alpha that is prolyl but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> asparaginyl hydroxylated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistent with this , co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Clioquinol-induced HIF-1alpha interacted with cAMP-responsive element-binding protein in normoxic cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">implying</cue> that Clioquinol stabilizes the trans-active form of HIF-1alpha</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> Clioquinol <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">could</cue> be useful as an inducer of HIF-1alpha and its target genes in ischemic diseases</scope></scope> .</sentence>
