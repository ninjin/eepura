<sentence id="0">Sodium butyrate ameliorates histone hypoacetylation and neurodegenerative phenotypes in a mouse model for DRPLA .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by polyglutamine expansion within the Atrophin-1 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To study the mechanism of this disease and to test potential therapeutic methods , we established Atro-118Q transgenic mice , which express in neurons a mutant human Atrophin-1 protein that contains an expanded stretch of 118 glutamines .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Consistent with the results from previous studies on transgenic mice that expressed mutant Atrophin-1 with 65 glutamines , Atro-118Q mice exhibited several neurodegenerative phenotypes that are commonly seen in DRPLA patients , including ataxia , tremors , and other motor defects .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Overexpression of wild-type human Atrophin-1 <cue type="neg" id="0">could <scope type="neg" id="0">not</cue> rescue the motor and survival defects in Atro-118Q mice</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> the mutant protein with polyglutamine expansion does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> simply function in a dominant negative manner</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Biochemical analysis of Atro-118Q mice revealed hypoacetylation of histone H3 in brain tissues and thus <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> that global gene repression is an underlying mechanism for neurodegeneration in this mouse model</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We further show that intraperitoneal administration of sodium butyrate , a histone deacetylase inhibitor , ameliorated the histone acetylation defects , significantly improved motor performance , and extended the average life span of Atro-118Q mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results support the <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">hypothesis</cue> that transcription deregulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine expansion diseases</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that reversion of transcription repression with small molecules such as sodium butyrate is a feasible approach to treating DRPLA symptoms</scope> .</sentence>
