<sentence id="3">In the well-characterized chemosensory systems of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. , efficient modification by either enzyme is dependent on a conserved pentapeptide sequence , NWETF or NWESF , present at the extreme carboxyl terminus of high-abundance chemoreceptors .</sentence>
