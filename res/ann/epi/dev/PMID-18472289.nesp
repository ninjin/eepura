<sentence id="0">The aggresome pathway as a target for therapy in hematologic malignancies .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Misfolded or unfolded proteins are often refolded with the help of chaperones or degraded by the 26S proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">An alternative fate of these proteins is the aggresome pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The microtubule-organizing center ( MTOC ) transports unfolded proteins to lysosomes and are degraded through autophagy .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) deacetylates alpha-tubulin , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be a component of the MTOC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Recently , two small molecule inhibitors of the aggresome pathway and HDAC6 have been described .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">One inhibitor , tubacin , prevents deacetylation of alpha-tubulin and produces accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Tubacin acts synergistically with the proteasome inhibitor , bortezomib , to induce cytotoxicity in one type of hematologic malignancy , multiple myeloma .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The other , LBH589 , is a pan HDAC inhibitor and hydroxamic acid derivative that induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells resistant to conventional therapies .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In this review , we summarize recent reports on targeting the aggresome pathway and HDAC6 in hematologic malignancies .</sentence>
