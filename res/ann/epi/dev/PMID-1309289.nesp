<sentence id="0">A <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> role of carbohydrate moieties in prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 receptor proteins from the porcine temporal cortex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The binding activities of prostaglandins ( PGs ) D2 and E2 were measured after deglycosylation of P2 membranes prepared from the porcine temporal cortex in order to investigate the role of carbohydrate moieties in the receptor binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PGD2 and PGE2 binding activities were significantly decreased by pretreatment with various exoglycosidases , such as neuraminidase for PGE2 binding , alpha-mannosidase and beta-galactosidase for PGD2 binding , and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase for both .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Further , peptide N-glycohydrolase F and endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase , which are specific for the cleavage of N-glycan and O-glycan linkages , respectively , in glycoproteins were used .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Pretreatment with either of them also reduced both PGD2 and PGE2 binding activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The reduction was dependent on the pretreatment time and enzyme concentration .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The time courses of the reduction were typically characterized by a marked increase in the nonspecific bindings .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Scatchard plot analysis revealed that the reduction was caused by a decrease in the affinity rather than one in the maximal binding capacity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The specificity of the binding sites thereby shifted to be more nonspecific without affecting the order of the relative affinities among PGs for the binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the carbohydrate moieties on PG receptor proteins of the brain are essential for the expression of their binding activities</scope> .</sentence>
