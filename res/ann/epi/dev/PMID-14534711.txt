Evaluation of CD44 variant 6 expression and clinicopathological factors in pulmonary metastases from colon carcinoma. 
Although relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression, recently CD44 glycoproteins and the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase have been identified as potentially important components of the metastatic cascade. CD44 is a family of transmembrane receptors generated from a single gene by alternative splicing and differential glycosylation. Important biological processes involving CD44 glycoproteins include cell adhesion, lymphocyte homing, hematopoiesis, tumor progression and metastasis. The precise mechanism via which CD44 promotes tumorigenesis have not yet been elucidated. We evaluated the expression of adhesion molecule CD44 variant 6 in pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinomas and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters. Twenty patients were randomly selected from the patients who had undergone a resection of pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival specimens of tumor tissues and adjacent normal mucosa from these patients were the subjects of the present study. Immunoreactivity for CD44 was quantified. Specimens were considered positive if almost 25% of the neoplastic cells were stained. CD44 v6 expression was related to the interval between colon resection and metastases diagnosis, the number of pulmonary metastases, and the survival after lung resection. No statistical correlation was found between CD44 v6 positivity and disease-free interval after colon resection, number of metastases or 2-year survival after lung resection. Probably CD44 v6 is necessary and sufficient to confer metastatic potential to carcinoma cells increasing the migration capacity and participating in invasion via changes in adhesion to the extracellular ligands, but is not necessary to modify the clinical history of the metastases. Therefore the evaluation of CD44 v6 expression in lung metastases does not influence the therapeutic scheme.
