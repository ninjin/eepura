<sentence id="0">Rapid proteasomal degradation of transcription factor IIB in accordance with F9 cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We found that the levels of all general transcription factors ( GTFs ) for RNA polymerase II decreased in F9 cells when the cells were subjected to a differentiation procedure .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Different from other GTFs , decrease of TFIIB during the differentiation was suppressed by addition of a proteasome inhibitor , MG132 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The half-life of TFIIB in the differentiated cells was remarkably reduced compared with that in the undifferentiated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , it was demonstrated that TFIIB is a poly-ubiquitinated protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Results of this study <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that components of the transcription machinery decreased in accordance with cell differentiation and that TFIIB is specifically and rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway</scope> .</sentence>
