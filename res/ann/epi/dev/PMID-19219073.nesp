<sentence id="0">Ubiquitination of mammalian AP endonuclease ( APE1 ) regulated by the p53-MDM2 signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">APE1/Ref-1 is an essential DNA repair/gene regulatory protein in mammals of which intracellular level significantly affects cellular sensitivity to genotoxicants .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 ( APE1 ) functions are altered by phosphorylation and acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We here report that APE1 is also modified by ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">APE1 ubiquitination occurred specifically at Lys residues near the N-terminus , and was markedly enhanced by mouse double minute 2 ( MDM2 ) , the major intracellular p53 inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , DNA-damaging reagents and nutlin-3 , an inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction , increased APE1 ubiquitination in the presence of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Downmodulation of MDM2 increased APE1 level , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination can be a signal for APE1 degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , unlike the wild-type APE1 , ubiquitin-APE1 fusion proteins were predominantly present in the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , monoubiquitination <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> only is a prerequisite for degradation</scope> , but <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> also alter the APE1 activities in cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results reveal a novel regulation of APE1 through ubiquitination .</sentence>
