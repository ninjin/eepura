Clinical and biochemical characteristics of congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ic, the first recognized endoplasmic reticulum defect in N-glycan synthesis. 
We report on 8 patients with a recently described novel subtype of congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ic (CDG-Ic). Their clinical presentation was mainly neurological with developmental retardation, muscular hypotonia, and epilepsy. Several symptoms commonly seen in CDG-Ia such as inverted nipples, abnormal fat distribution, and cerebellar hypoplasia were not observed. The clinical course is milder overall, with a better neurological outcome, than in CDG-Ia. The isoelectric focusing pattern of serum transferrin in CDG-Ia and CDG-Ic is indistinguishable. Interestingly, beta-trace protein in cerebrospinal fluid derived from immunoblot analysis of the brain showed a less pronounced hypoglycosylation pattern in CDG-Ic patients than in CDG-Ia patients. Analysis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides revealed an accumulation of Man9GlcNAc2 intermediates due to dolichol pyrophosphate-Man9GlcNAc2 alpha-1,3 glucosyltransferase deficiency. All patients were homozygous for an A333V mutation.
