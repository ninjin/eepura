<sentence id="0">The glycosylation status of murine [ corrected ] postnatal thymus : a study by histochemistry and lectin blotting .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During the intrathymic development , the fate of the thymocytes depends largely on variable expression of CD4/CD8 markers and T cell receptor protein expressions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , changes of cell surface glycosylation status also affect the thymocyte maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study the glycosylation alterations in thymic tissues from 1 , 9 , 13 and 16 days old mice were evaluated by histochemical and lectin blotting techniques .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">With alcian blue ( AB ) at pH 5.7/periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS ) stainings , it was shown that thymic microenvironments contained carboxlylated and sulfated glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Strong positivity to AB at pH 2.5 , which specific for sialomucins , was seen in some medullary thymocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Similarly , it was shown that with Maackia amurensis agglutinin ( MAL ) medullary thymocytes , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> cortical ones</scope> , contained alpha(2 -- > 3 ) linked sialic acid structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">On the other hand , while reaction with peanut agglutinin ( PNA ) , which specific for core disaccharide galactose beta(1 -- > 3 ) N-acetylgalactosamine , was only seen in cortical thymocytes , reaction with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin ( GNA ) , which specific for terminal mannose residues , was seen in both cortex and medulla .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , Datura stramonium agglutinin ( DSA ) , which recognizes galactose beta(1 -- > 4 ) N-acetylglucosamine , was not only cell-specific , but it was bound some thymic vessels .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">With lectin blotting studies , five glycoprotein bands of molecular weights approximately 39 , approximately 54 , 100 , approximately 110 and approximately 212 were found which reacted with MAL , PNA and DSA as well as GNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that glycosylation patterns of cell surface glycoconjugates are modified during thymocyte selection processes of postnatal days</scope> .</sentence>
