<sentence id="0">Glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylates hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and mediates its destabilization in a VHL-independent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) is a key player in the response to hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Additionally , HIF-1alpha responds to growth factors and hormones which can act via protein kinase B ( Akt ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , HIF-1alpha is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> a direct substrate for this kinase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Therefore , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the protein kinase B target glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK-3 ) <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> have an impact on HIF-1alpha</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that the inhibition or depletion of GSK-3 induced HIF-1alpha whereas the overexpression of GSK-3beta reduced HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These effects were mediated via three amino acid residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , mutation analyses and experiments with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective cells <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> GSK-3 mediates HIF-1alpha degradation in a VHL-independent manner</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In line with these observations , the inhibition of the proteasome reversed the GSK-3 effects , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> GSK-3 <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> target HIF-1alpha to the proteasome by phosphorylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , the direct regulation of HIF-1alpha stability by GSK-3 <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> influence physiological processes or pathophysiological situations such as metabolic diseases or tumors</scope> .</sentence>
