<sentence id="0">Expression and characterization of human factor IX and factor IX-factor X chimeras in mouse C127 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human blood clotting factor IX , and two chimeric molecules of factor IX , in which the first epidermal growth factor-like domain or both epidermal growth factor-like domains have been replaced by that of human factor X , have been expressed in mouse C127 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The recombinants have been purified using a metal ion-dependent monoclonal antibody specific for residues 1-42 of human factor IX .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">All recombinant molecules are activated normally by human factor XIa in the presence of calcium ion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Activation of the factor IX recombinants by factor VIIa-tissue factor <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be normal for the epidermal growth factor-1 exchange but considerably reduced for the construction containing both epidermal growth factor-like domains of factor X. The analysis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues reveals that all of the purified recombinants are almost fully carboxylated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The extent of aspartic acid hydroxylation at residue 64 is 60 % for all recombinants .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The chimeric molecule with both epidermal growth factor-like domains from factor X has about 4 % normal activity in the activated partial thromboplastin time assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , the construct containing the first epidermal growth factor-like domain of factor X shows essentially normal clotting activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , it is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unlikely</cue> that this domain is involved in a unique interaction with factor VIII</scope> .</sentence>
