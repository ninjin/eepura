<sentence id="0">Tracking global patterns of N-linked glycosylation site variation in highly variable viral glycoproteins : HIV , SIV , and HCV envelopes and influenza hemagglutinin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human and simian immunodeficiency viruses ( HIV and SIV ) , influenza virus , and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) have heavily glycosylated , highly variable surface proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we explore N-linked glycosylation site ( sequon ) variation at the population level in these viruses , using a new Web-based program developed to facilitate the sequon tracking and to define patterns ( www.hiv.lanl.gov ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This tool allowed rapid visualization of the two distinctive patterns of sequon variation found in HIV-1 , HIV-2 , and SIV CPZ .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The first pattern ( fixed ) describes readily aligned sites that are either <scope type="spec" id="0"> simply present <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> absent</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These sites tend to be occupied by high-mannose glycans .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The second pattern ( shifting ) refers to sites embedded in regions of extreme local length variation and is characterized by shifts in terms of the relative position and local density of sequons ; these sites tend to be populated by complex carbohydrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">HIV , with its extreme variation in number and precise location of sequons , does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> have a net increase in the number of sites over time at the population level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Primate lentiviral lineages have host species-dependent levels of sequon shifting , with HIV-1 in humans the most extreme .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">HCV E1 and E2 proteins , despite evolving extremely rapidly through point mutation , show limited sequon variation , although two shifting sites were identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Human influenza A hemagglutinin H3 HA1 is accumulating sequons over time , but this trend is not evident in any other avian or human influenza A serotypes .</sentence>
