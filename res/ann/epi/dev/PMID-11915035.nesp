<sentence id="0">Polymorphism of the N-acetyltransferase 2 gene as a susceptibility risk factor for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis is one of the most prevalent drug-induced liver injuries .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Isoniazid is the major drug incriminated in this hepatotoxicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Isoniazid is mainly metabolized to hepatotoxic intermediates by N-acetyltransferase ( NAT ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , the association of polymorphic NAT acetylator status and antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis is debatable .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> acetylator status is a risk factor for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis</scope> , we genotyped NAT2 in 224 incident tuberculosis patients who received antituberculosis treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis was diagnosed based on a positive isoniazid rechallenge test and exclusion of viral hepatitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Acetylator status was determined by genotyping NAT2 in patients using a polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the risk factors of isoniazid-induced hepatitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thirty-three patients ( 14.7 % ) were diagnosed with antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Slow acetylators had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators ( 26.4 % vs. 11.1 % , P = .013 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Among patients with hepatotoxicity , slow acetylators had significantly higher serum aminotransferase levels than rapid acetylators .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Logistic regression showed that slow-acetylator status ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 3.66 ; 95 % CI , 1.58-8.49 ; P = .003 ) and age ( OR , 1.09 ; 95 % CI , 1.04-1.14 ; P < .001 ) were the only 2 independent risk factors for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">In conclusion , slow-acetylator status of NAT2 is a significant susceptibility risk factor for antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Additionally , slow acetylators are prone to develop more severe hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Regular monitoring of serum aminotransferase levels is mandatory in patients receiving antituberculosis treatment , especially in slow acetylators .</sentence>
