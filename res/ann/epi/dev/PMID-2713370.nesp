<sentence id="0">Clonal analysis of the glycosylation of immunoglobulin G secreted by murine hybridomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A panel of 10 hybridomas was assembled to assess the influence of various genetic and biological factors upon glycosylation of secreted monoclonal IgG .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">After exhaustive Pronase digestion of IgG , glycopeptides were characterized chromatographically by apparent size , charge , and concanavalin A ( Con A ) -Sepharose and Lens culinaris (LcH)-agarose affinity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Six glycosylation phenotypes were found to be common among all clones studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Despite this phenotypic heterogeneity in glycosylation of IgG , considerable similarity exists between different clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In particular , virtually all IgG glycopeptides bear a core fucose residue .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Second , the majority of the glycosylation repertoire is comprised of two phenotypes , characterized by glycopeptides which differ in affinity for Con A-Sepharose .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Of these , the predominantly expressed phenotype is the same for all clones .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The carbohydrate structure derived from this phenotype , elucidated by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy , is ( Formula : see text ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Significant variability between different hybridomas exists in the relative expression of the two major phenotypes .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Other differences between clones <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> reflect the expression of an additional site which is glycosylated differently</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , there is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> apparent correlation of phenotype with either the hybridoma 's parentage or the serologically defined polypeptide structure of the IgG which it secretes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In addition to clonal variability , other sources of variability in phenotypic expression were identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">A generational variability is apparent upon continuous culturing of the same hybridoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Also , differences in culture medium pH or proliferative state of the cells <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> have a modest influence upon the glycosylation phenotype</scope> .</sentence>
