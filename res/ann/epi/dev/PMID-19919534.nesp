<sentence id="0">GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase is essential in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> GDP-Man PP</scope> ( guanidine diphosphomannose pyrophosphorylase ) gene from Trypanosoma brucei ( TbGDP-Man PP ) was identified in the genome and subsequently cloned , sequenced and recombinantly expressed , and shown to be a catalytically active dimer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Kinetic analysis revealed a Vmax of 0.34 mumol/min per mg of protein and Km values of 67 muM and 12 muM for GTP and mannose 1-phosphate respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Further kinetic studies showed GDP-Man was a potent product feedback inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RNAi ( RNA interference ) of the cytosolic TbGDP-Man PP showed that mRNA levels were reduced to ~ 20 % of wild-type levels , causing the cells to die after 3-4 days , demonstrating that TbGDP-Man PP is essential in the bloodstream form of T. brucei and thus a potential drug target .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The RNAi-induced parasites have a greatly reduced capability to form GDP-Man , leading ultimately to a reduction in their ability to synthesize their essential GPI ( glycosylphosphatidylinositol ) anchors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The RNAi-induced parasites also showed aberrant N-glycosylation of their major cell-surface glycoprotein , variant surface glycoprotein , with loss of the high-mannose Man9GlcNAc2 N-glycosylation at Asn428 and formation of complex N-glycans at Asn263 .</sentence>
