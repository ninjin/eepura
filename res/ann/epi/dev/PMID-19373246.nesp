<sentence id="0">CYLD : a tumor suppressor deubiquitinase regulating NF-kappaB activation and diverse biological processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein ubiquitination is a reversible reaction , in which the ubiquitin chains are deconjugated by a family of deubiquitinases ( DUBs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The presence of a large number of DUBs <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that they <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> possess certain levels of substrate selectivity and functional specificity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Indeed , recent studies show that a tumor suppressor DUB , cylindromatosis ( CYLD ) , has a predominant role in the regulation of NF-kappaB , a transcription factor that promotes cell survival and oncogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">NF-kappaB activation involves attachment of K63-linked ubiquitin chains to its upstream signaling factors , <scope type="spec" id="2"> which is <cue type="spec" id="2">thought</cue> to facilitate protein-protein interactions in the assembly of signaling complexes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By deconjugating these K63-linked ubiquitin chains , CYLD negatively regulates NF-kappaB activation , which <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> contribute to its tumor suppressor function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CYLD also regulates diverse physiological processes , ranging from immune response and inflammation to cell cycle progression , spermatogenesis , and osteoclastogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , CYLD itself is subject to different mechanisms of regulation .</sentence>
