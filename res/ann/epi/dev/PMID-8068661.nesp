<sentence id="0">Protein carboxyl methylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae : evidence for STE14-dependent and STE14-independent pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We incubated yeast cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) with the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine and then fractionated their cellular components by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">By analyzing gel slices for [3H]methyl esters by a vapor-phase diffusion assay , we detect major methyl-esterified species that migrate at apparent polypeptide sizes of 24 and 22 kDa and minor species of 49 , 38 , 35 , 33 , 31 , and 26 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Incubation of extracts from labeled cells with ribonuclease A or proteinase K revealed that the 24- and 22-kDa species represent methyl-esterified RNAs , whereas the other species are methyl-esterified polypeptides .</sentence>
