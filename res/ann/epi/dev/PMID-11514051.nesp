<sentence id="0">Characterization of the secretable ectodomain of thyrotropin receptor produced by the recombinant baculovirus system .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Thyrotropin receptor ( TSHR ) is a member of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family and an autoantigen of Graves ' disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Various attempts have been made to obtain a large amount of soluble ectodomain of TSHR in insect or mammalian cells , but most of them <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to secrete the overexpressed ectodomain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study , we observed that about one-third of the ectodomain protein ( sTSHR-gp ) , in which the signal peptide of TSHR was replaced by the baculovirus-encoded glycoprotein 67-signal peptide , was secreted into the culture medium and the remainder stayed within cells in the recombinant baculovirus system .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Microsequencing the N-terminal of the purified protein confirmed that the baculovirus signal peptide was cleaved at the expected site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Carbohydrate studies using several glycosidases and lectins revealed that the secreted form of the ectodomain had biantennary carbohydrate , whereas the non-secreted form had high-mannose .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , the secreted form of sTSHR-gp exhibited high-affinity ligand binding , whereas the non-secreted form did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> show any significant ligand binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Regarding the interactions of TSHR ectodomains with anti-TSHR antibodies , both the secreted and non-secreted forms of sTSHR-gp , almost completely neutralized the stimulatory and inhibitory anti-TSHR antibody activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In conclusion , we succeeded in secreting the ectodomain of TSHR into culture medium , which was capable of binding to TSH and neutralizing anti-TSHR antibody activities .</sentence>
