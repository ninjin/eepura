<sentence id="0">A method for determining the in vivo topology of yeast polytopic membrane proteins demonstrates that Gap1p fully integrates into the membrane independently of Shr3p .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The general amino acid permease ( Gap1p ) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an integral membrane protein that contains 12 hydrophobic regions predicted to be membrane-spanning segments .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A topological reporter construct , encoding an internal 53-amino acid peptide of invertase ( Suc2p ) containing three Asp-X-Ser/Thr glycosylation sites , was inserted in-frame into the hydrophilic NH(2)- and COOH-terminal domains and each of the 11 hydrophilic loops that separate the 12 hydrophobic segments of Gap1p .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The resulting 13 gene sandwich fusion proteins were expressed in a gap1Delta null mutant strain ; 9 of these retain amino acid transport activity and are folded and correctly targeted to the plasma membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The glycosylation state of each of the fusion proteins was monitored ; the results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> all 12 hydrophobic segments of Gap1p span the membrane , and the NH(2) and COOH termini are cytoplasmically oriented</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results were independently tested by isolating sealed right-side-out microsomes from sec12-1 strains expressing six different Gap1p constructs containing functional factor Xa protease cleavage sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The pattern of factor Xa protease cleavage was found to be consistent with the presence of 12 membrane-spanning domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Gap1p exhibited the same membrane topology in strains <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacking</cue> Shr3p</scope> ; therefore , Gap1p fully integrates into the ER membrane independently of this permease-specific packaging chaperone .</sentence>
