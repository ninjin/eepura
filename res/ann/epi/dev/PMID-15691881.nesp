<sentence id="0">The role of protein kinase A pathway and cAMP responsive element-binding protein in androgen receptor-mediated transcription at the prostate-specific antigen locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Androgen-independent prostate cancer is a lethal form of the disease that is marked by metastasis and rapid proliferation in its final stages .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effective therapy for this aggressive tumor currently exists</scope> , it is imperative to elucidate and target the mechanisms involved in the progression to androgen independence .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Accumulating evidence <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates that</cue> aberrant activation of androgen receptor ( AR ) via signal transduction pathways , AR gene mutation and/or amplification , and/or coregulator alterations <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> contribute to the progression of prostate cancer</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , the effects of protein kinase A ( PKA ) signaling and its downstream factors on AR activity at the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) gene were tested .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Activation of PKA by forskolin resulted in enhanced androgen-induced expression of the PSA gene , an effect that was blocked by the AR antagonist , bicalutamide .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , when either p300 or CBP was overexpressed , PKA activation was sufficient to stimulate PSA promoter-driven transcription in the <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of androgen</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="4">which was <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> inhibited by bicalutamide</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">PKA activation did not significantly alter AR protein levels but significantly increased the phosphorylated form of its downstream effector , cAMP responsive element-binding protein ( CREB ) in the presence of androgen .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that the combination of androgen and forskolin increased phosphorylated CREB occupancy , which was accompanied by histone acetylation , at the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">putative</cue> cAMP responsive element located in the 5' upstream regulatory region of the PSA gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Remarkably , mammalian two-hybrid assay <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicated that</cue> p300/CBP <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> bridge the interaction between AR and CREB</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggesting</cue> a novel enhanceosomal cooperation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results demonstrate an intriguing interplay between a signal transduction pathway , coactivator overexpression and AR signaling as a <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">possible</cue> combined</scope> mechanism of progression to androgen-independent prostate cancer .</sentence>
