<sentence id="0">VprBP targets Merlin to the Roc1-Cul4A-DDB1 E3 ligase complex for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inactivation of the neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) tumor suppressor gene function has been observed not only in familial schwannomas and other central nervous system tumors , but also in malignant tumors unrelated to the NF2 syndrome , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> a broader role of NF2 in human tumorigenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The NF2-encoded protein Merlin is closely related to the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family of membrane/cytoskeleton linker proteins , and has been demonstrated to suppress tumor growth by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) and Rac1 activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Interestingly , serum deprivation has been shown to regulate Merlin at the protein level , however , exactly how such condition affects Merlin remains elusive .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we provide evidence to show that Merlin is regulated in a Roc1-Cullin4A-DDB1-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Following serum stimulation , Merlin is recruited to the E3 ligase complex through a direct interaction with the WD40-containing adaptor protein VprBP .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Loading of Merlin to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex resulted in its polyubiquitination , and consequently its proteasome-mediated degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistently , VprBP depletion abolished the in vivo interaction of Merlin and Roc1-Cullin4A-DDB1 , which resulted in Merlin stabilization and inhibited ERK and Rac activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , our data revealed a novel regulatory mechanism for the tumor suppressor function of Merlin .</sentence>
