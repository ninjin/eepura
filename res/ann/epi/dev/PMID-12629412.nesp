<sentence id="0">The roles of supernumerical X chromosomes and XIST expression in testicular germ cell tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PURPOSE : An overabundance of X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumors and the identification of the candidate testicular germ cell tumor susceptibility gene TGCT1 on Xq27 highlight the potential involvement of X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumor pathogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The current study was designed to shed light on the question <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the multiple X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumor are active or inactive through a complex mechanism of X chromosomal gain and XIST expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">MATERIALS AND METHODS : We analyzed 4 testicular germ cell tumor derived cell lines and 20 primary testicular germ cell tumor tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The number of X chromosomes was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization using the X chromosome specific probe .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The expression patterns of XIST and the 3 X-linked genes androgen receptor ( AR ) , fragile X mental retardation ( FMR1 ) and Glypican 3 ( GPC3 ) were studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Bisulfite genomic sequencing was used to analyze the methylation patterns of the AR , FMR1 and GPC3 genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The relative expression levels of the 2 X-linked proto-oncogenes ARAF1 and ELK1 were assayed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">RESULTS : XIST expression was common in seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors ( 2 of 2 or 100 % of seminoma derived cell lines and 10 of 12 or 83 % of seminomatous testicular germ cell tumor tissues ) but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors ( 0 of 2 or 0 % nonseminoma derived cell lines and 2 of 8 or 25 % of nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumor tissues</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , X chromosomal gain was consistently observed in the 2 types of tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="10"><scope type="neg" id="2">XIST expression in testicular germ cell tumors and normal testicular parenchyma was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> associated with methylation of the AR , FMR1 or GPC3 genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">After determining the expression patterns of AR , FMR1 and GPC3 in testicular germ cell tumor samples we concluded that multiple X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumors were predominantly hypomethylated and active regardless of XIST expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="12"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The biological significance of excess active X chromosomes in testicular germ cell tumors was <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> by enhanced expression of the 2 X-linked oncogenes ARAF1 and ELK1 in the testicular germ cell tumor derived cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSIONS : The current data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> the potential oncogenic implications of X chromosomal gain in testicular germ cell tumors</scope></scope> .</sentence>
