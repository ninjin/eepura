<sentence id="0">Glucocorticoid regulation and glycosylation of mouse intestinal type IIb Na-P(i) cotransporter during ontogeny .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We sought to characterize expression of an apically expressed intestinal Na-P(i) cotransporter ( Na-P(i)-IIb ) during mouse ontogeny and to assess the effects of methylprednisolone ( MP ) treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In control mice , Na-P(i) uptake by intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles was highest at 14 days of age , lower at 21 days , and further reduced at 8 wk and 8-9 mo of age .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Na-P(i)-IIb mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels in 14-day-old animals were markedly higher than in older groups .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">MP treatment significantly decreased Na-P(i) uptake and Na-P(i)-IIb mRNA and protein expression in 14-day-old mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Additionally , the size of the protein was smaller in 14-day-old mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Deglycosylation of protein from 14-day-old and 8-wk-old animals with peptide N-glycosidase reduced the molecular weight to the predicted size .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that intestinal Na-P(i) uptake and Na-P(i)-IIb expression are highest at 14 days and decrease with age .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , MP treatment reduced intestinal Na-P(i) uptake approximately threefold in 14-day-old mice and this reduction correlates with reduced Na-P(i)-IIb mRNA and protein expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We also demonstrate that Na-P(i)-IIb is an N-linked glycoprotein and that glycosylation is age dependent .</sentence>
