A comparison of accessibility of ribosomal proteins on free and membrane-bound ribosomes: the ribosomal proteins potentially involved in ribosome-membrane binding. 
The relative accessibility of rat liver ribosomal proteins to reductive methylation was examined using membrane-bound and free ribosomes. Comparisons indicated that 12-13 large ribosomal proteins are masked by ribosomal association with membranes. These consisted of L8, L10, L17, L26-28, L31 and L36, and probably also include L4, L5, L7 and L29. These proteins seem to surround a region centered about L3 and may partly define a ribosomal channel through which the nascent peptide emerges. Approx. 10-20% of the large ribosomal subunit surface area is shielded by the membrane.
