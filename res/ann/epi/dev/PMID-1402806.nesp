<sentence id="0">Sequence analysis of the membrane protein gene of human coronavirus OC43 and evidence for O-glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The gene encoding the membrane ( M ) protein of the OC43 strain of human coronavirus ( HCV-OC43 ) was amplified by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of viral RNA with HCV-OC43- and bovine coronavirus (BCV)-specific primers .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The nucleotide sequence of the cloned 1.5 kb fragment revealed an open reading frame ( ORF ) of 690 nucleotides which was identified as the M protein gene from its homology to BCV .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This ORF encodes a protein of 230 amino acids with an M(r) of 26416 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The gene is preceded by the motif UCCAAAC , analogous to the consensus coronavirus transcription initiation sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The M protein of HCV-OC43 shows features typical of all coronavirus M proteins studied : a hydrophilic , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">presumably</cue> external</scope> N terminus including about 10 % of the protein , and a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> N-glycosylation site followed by three major hydrophobic transmembrane domains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The amino acid sequence of the M protein of HCV-OC43 has 94 % identity with that of the Mebus strain of BCV , and also contains six <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potential</cue> O-glycosylation sites</scope> in the exposed N-terminal domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Indeed , <scope type="neg" id="3">the glycosylation of the M protein was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> inhibited in the presence of tunicamycin</scope> , which is indicative of O-glycosylation , as previously reported for BCV and murine hepatitis virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Virions released from tunicamycin-treated cells contained the M glycoprotein but were devoid of both peplomer ( S ) and haemagglutinin-esterase ( HE ) proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , inhibition of the N-glycosylation of the S and HE structural proteins prevented their incorporation into progeny virions , an <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indication</cue> that they are dispensable for virion morphogenesis</scope> , unlike the M protein .</sentence>
