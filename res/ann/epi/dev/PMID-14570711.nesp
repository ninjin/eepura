<sentence id="0">Promoter-restricted H3 Lys 4 di-methylation is an epigenetic mark for monoallelic expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of histone tails has been implicated in long-term epigenetic memory .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Methylated H3 Lys 4 ( K4 ) is a generally conserved mark for euchromatic , transcriptionally active regions , although <scope type="spec" id="0"> the effect of this modification is <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> also to depend on its distribution both within the euchromatic region and more specifically within a given gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we describe a profile of H3K4 di-methylation that is specific for monoallelically expressed genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both X-linked genes subject to X-inactivation and autosomal imprinted genes have di-methylated H3K4 restricted to their promoter regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , high levels of H3K4 di-methylation are found in both promoters and exonic parts of autosomal genes and of X-linked genes that escape X-inactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that this pattern of promoter restricted H3 Lys 4 di-methylation , already present in totipotent cells , is causally related to the long-term programming of allelic expression</scope> and provides an epigenetic mark for monoallelically expressed genes .</sentence>
