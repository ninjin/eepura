<sentence id="0">Coordinate regulation of the oxygen-dependent degradation domains of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxygen-dependent proteolysis is the primary means of regulating the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) family of transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The alpha-subunit of HIF factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) contains two highly conserved oxygen-dependent degradation domains ( 402 ODD and 564 ODD ) , each of which includes a proline that is hydroxylated in the presence of oxygen , allowing the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) E3 ubiquitin ligase to interact and target HIF-1alpha to the proteasome for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Mutation of either proline is sufficient to partially stabilize HIF-1alpha under conditions of normoxia , but the specific contributions of each hydroxylation event to the regulation of HIF-1alpha are unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that the two ODDs of HIF-1alpha have independent yet interactive roles in the regulation of HIF-1alpha protein turnover , with the relative involvement of each ODD depending on the levels of oxygen .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using hydroxylation-specific antibodies , we found that under conditions of normoxia proline 564 is hydroxylated prior to proline 402 , and mutation of proline 564 results in a significant reduction in the hydroxylation of proline 402 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutation of proline 402 , however , has little effect on the hydroxylation of proline 564 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the more rapid hydroxylation of the proline 564 under conditions of normoxia is due to a preference for the particular sequence surrounding proline 564 or for that site within the protein</scope> , we exchanged the degradation domains within the full-length HIF-1alpha protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In these domain-swapping experiments , prolyl hydroxylase domain 1 ( PHD1 ) and PHD2 preferentially hydroxylated the proline located in the site of the original 564 ODD , while PHD3 preferred the proline 564 sequence , regardless of its location .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">At limiting oxygen tensions , we found that proline 402 exhibits an oxygen-dependent decrease in hydroxylation at higher oxygen tensions relative to proline 564 hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> hydroxylation of proline 402 is highly responsive to physiologic changes in oxygen and , therefore , plays a more important role in HIF-1alpha regulation under conditions of hypoxia than under conditions of normoxia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Together , these findings demonstrate that each hydroxylated proline of HIF-1alpha has a distinct activity in controlling HIF-1alpha stability in response to different levels of oxygenation .</sentence>
