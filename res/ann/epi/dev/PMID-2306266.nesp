<sentence id="0">Release of [hydroxyproline3]-kinins by tissue kallikreins of pig , rat and man .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To determine the susceptibility of kininogens containing the recently described [Hyp3]-bradykinin moiety to cleavage by tissue kallikreins , we have studied the release of [Hyp3]-kinins from heat inactivated human plasma by purified tissue kallikreins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Kallikreins from man and pig were employed and compared with purified rat urinary kallikrein which is known to have a different cleavage specificity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Kinins released were separated by a modified reversed phase HPLC method and quantitated by bioassay and radioimmunoassay .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Human urinary kallikrein and hog tissue kallikreins released 85-90 % of the total kinins as Lys-bradykinin and 10-15 % as [Hyp3]-Lys-bradykinin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , rat urinary kallikrein released 77 % as bradykinin , 22 % as [Hyp3]-bradykinin and negligible amounts of [Hyp3]-Lys-bradykinin from the identical substrate source <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> rat tissue kallikreins prefer the Lys-Arg-bond within both unhydroxylated and hydroxylated kininogens</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , hydroxylation of human kininogens apparently does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect their ability to serve as substrates for tissue kallikreins with different cleavage specificities</scope> .</sentence>
