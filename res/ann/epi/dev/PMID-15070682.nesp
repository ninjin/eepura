<sentence id="0">Thrombophilic dysfibrinogen Tokyo V with the amino acid substitution of gammaAla327Thr : formation of fragile but fibrinolysis-resistant fibrin clots and its relevance to arterial thromboembolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Thrombophilic dysfibrinogen Tokyo V was identified in a 43-year-old man with recurrent thromboembolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Based on analyses of the patient fibrinogen genes , the amino acid sequence of the aberrant fibrinogen peptide , and deglycosylation experiments , fibrinogen Tokyo V was shown to have an amino acid substitution of gamma Ala327Thr and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> extra</scope> glycosylation at gamma Asn325 because the mutation confers the N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence Asn-X-Thr .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The mutation resulted in impaired function and hypofibrinogenemia ( hypodysfibrinogen ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Polymerization of fibrin monomers derived from patient fibrinogen was severely impaired with a partial correction in the presence of calcium , resulting in very low clottability .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Additionally , a large amount of soluble cross-linked fibrin was formed upon thrombin treatment in the presence of factor XIII and calcium .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , Tokyo V-derived fibrin was resistant to degradation by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-catalyzed plasmin digestion .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The structure of Tokyo V fibrin appeared severely perturbed , since there are large pores inside the tangled fibrin networks and fiber ends at the boundaries .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , these data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that Tokyo V fibrin clots are fragile , so that <scope type="spec" id="2"> fibrinolysis-resistant insoluble fibrin and soluble fibrin polymers <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be released to the circulation , partly accounting for the recurrent embolic episodes in the patient</scope></scope> .</sentence>
