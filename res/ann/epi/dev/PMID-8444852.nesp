<sentence id="0">Purification and characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA damage-responsive protein 48 ( DDRP 48 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A yeast protein was purified from wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ) to near homogeneity using an ethanolamine affinity chromatography procedure .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The N-terminal amino acid sequencing and the amino acid composition analyses identified this protein as the product of the second open reading frame of S. cerevisiae DNA Damage-responsive gene 48 ( DDR48 ) ( Treger , J.M. , and McEntee , K. ( 1990 ) Mol .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cell. Biol. 10 , 3174-3184 ) The first methionine residue encoded by the translation starting codon was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> present in the mature protein which is designated as DDRP 48</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DDRP 48 was found to be a negatively charged and highly hydrophilic glycoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The glycosidase cleavage analyses <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that DDRP 48 was mainly N-link-glycosylated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The apparent molecular mass of DDRP 48 was estimated to be approximately 65 kilodaltons .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">DDRP 48 was found able to hydrolyze ATP and GTP yielding PPi .</sentence>

<sentence id="9">The Western blot analysis demonstrated that DDRP 48 was expressed to various concentrations in different S. cerevisiae strains .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Increased DDRP 48 abundance was observed after yeast cells carrying the wild type RAD 52 gene were exposed to either ethylmethane sulfonate or heat shock treatments .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">After similar DNA-damaging treatments , however , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> significant inductions of DDRP 48 were found in a rad 52 mutant strain</scope> .</sentence>
