<sentence id="0">The initiation and pattern of spread of histone H4 acetylation parallel the order of transcriptional activation of genes in the aflatoxin cluster .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The 27 genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis are clustered within a 70 kb region in the Aspergillus parasiticus genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using chromatin immunoprecipitation , we demonstrated a positive correlation between the initiation and spread of histone H4 acetylation in aflatoxin promoters and the onset of accumulation of aflatoxin proteins and aflatoxin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Histone H4 acetylation in the pksA ( encodes an ' early ' biosynthetic pathway enzyme ) promoter peaked at 30 h , prior to the increased acetylation in the omtA and ordA ( encode ' late ' enzymes ) promoters detected at 40 h. The specific order in which pksA , ver-1 ( encodes a ' middle ' enzyme ) and omtA transcripts accumulated in cells paralleled the pattern of spread of histone H4 acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Binding of AflR , a positive regulator of aflatoxin biosynthesis , to the ordA promoter showed a positive correlation with the spread of histone H4 acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the order of genes within the aflatoxin cluster determines the timing and order of transcriptional activation , and that the site of initiation and spread of histone H4 acetylation mediate this process</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> the aflatoxin and adjacent sugar utilization clusters are part of a larger ' regulatory unit</scope> ' .</sentence>
