<sentence id="1">Molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics have been used to investigate the mechanisms of (+)AdoMet methylation of protein-Lys-NH(2) catalyzed by the lysine methyltransferase enzymes : histone lysine monomethyltransferase SET7/9 , Rubisco large-subunit dimethyltransferase , viral histone lysine trimethyltransferase , and the Tyr245Phe mutation of SET7/9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">At neutrality in aqueous solution , primary amines are protonated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The enzyme reacts with Lys-NH(3)(+) and (+)AdoMet species to provide an Enz.Lys-NH(3)(+) .</sentence>

<sentence id="7">Repeat of the sequence provides dimethylated lysine , and another repeat yields a trimethylated lysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The sequence is halted at monomethylation when the conformation of the Enz.Lys-N(Me)H(2)(+) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">( + ) AdoMet has the methyl positioned to block formation of a water channel .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The sequence of reactions stops at dimethylation if the conformation of Enz.Lys-N(Me)(2)H(+) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">( + ) AdoMet has a methyl in position , which forbids the formation of the water channel .</sentence>
