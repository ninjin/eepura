<sentence id="0">Dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 demarcates regulatory and nonregulatory chromatin genome-wide .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Set2p , which mediates histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation ( H3K36me2 ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , has been shown to associate with RNA polymerase II ( RNAP II ) at individual loci .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray experiments normalized to general nucleosome occupancy reveal that nucleosomes within open reading frames ( ORFs ) and downstream noncoding chromatin were highly dimethylated at H3K36 and that Set2p activity begins at a stereotypic distance from the initiation of transcription genome-wide .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">H3K36me2 is scarce in regions upstream of divergently transcribed genes , telomeres , silenced mating loci , and regions transcribed by RNA polymerase III , providing evidence that the enzymatic activity of Set2p is restricted to its association with RNAP II .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The presence of H3K36me2 within ORFs correlated with the " on " or " off " state of transcription , but the degree of H3K36 dimethylation within ORFs did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> correlate with transcription frequency</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This provides evidence that H3K36me2 is established during the initial instances of gene transcription , with subsequent transcription having at most a maintenance role .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Accordingly , newly activated genes acquire H3K36me2 in a manner that does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> correlate with gene transcript levels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , nucleosomes dimethylated at H3K36 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to be refractory to loss from highly transcribed chromatin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , H3K36me2 , which is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution , provides a stable molecular mechanism for establishing chromatin context throughout the genome by distinguishing potential regulatory regions from transcribed chromatin .</sentence>
