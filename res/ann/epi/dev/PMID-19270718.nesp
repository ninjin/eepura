<sentence id="0">Phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser468 controls its COMMD1-dependent ubiquitination and target gene-specific proteasomal elimination .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) transcription factor system is a crucial component that controls several important biological functions , thus raising the need for mechanisms that ensure the correct termination of its activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we identify a new phosphorylation/ubiquitination switch in the NF-kappaB network that controls the stability of the transactivating p65 subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Tumour necrosis factor-induced phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468 allows binding of COMMD1 and cullin 2 , components of a multimeric ubiquitin ligase complex mediating p65 ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutation of p65 at Ser468 largely prevents p65 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Inducible p65 elimination is restricted to a subset of NF-kappaB target genes such as Icam1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Accordingly , chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal the selective recruitment of Ser468-phosphorylated p65 and COMMD1 to the Icam1 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468 leads to ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent removal of chromatin-bound p65 , thus contributing to the selective termination of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression .</sentence>
