<sentence id="4">The expressed protein devoid of N-linked oligosaccharides also formed trimers , but was secreted from cells in significantly less amounts than glycosylated trimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Pulse-chase studies showed that the disulfide-linked trimers were assembled inside the cells no earlier than 30 min after protein synthesis commenced and after the intracellular precursors were N-glycosylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Trimer formation was inhibited in cells treated with brefeldin A , monensin , chloroquine , or bafilomycin A1 , although only brefeldin A prevented the secretion of the protein .</sentence>
