T1001	Span 1182 1358	indicate that NF-Y is embedded in positive as well as in negative methyl histone marks, serving a dual function in transcriptional regulation, as an activator or as a repressor

T1003	Span 607 857	indicates that NF-Y loci can be divided in two distinct clusters: (i) a large cohort contains H3K9-14ac and H3K4me3 marks and correlates with expression and (ii) a sizeable group is devoid of these marks and is found on transcriptionally silent genes
