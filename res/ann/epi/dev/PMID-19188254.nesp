<sentence id="0">Sem1p and Ubp6p orchestrate telomeric silencing by modulating histone H2B ubiquitination and H3 acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone covalent modifications and 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis modulate many regulatory events in eukaryotes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , heterochromatin mediates transcriptional silencing at telomeres , HM loci and rDNA array .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that proteasome-associated Sem1p and its interacting partner , Ubp6p ( a deubiquitinating enzyme ) , are essential to maintain telomeric silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Simultaneous deletion of SEM1 and UBP6 induces dramatic silencing defect accompanied by significantly increased level of ubiquitinated-histone H2B and markedly reduced levels of acetylated-lysine 14 and 23 on histone H3 at the telomeres .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , the loss of Sem1p and Ubp6p triggers relocation of silencing factors ( e.g. Sir proteins ) from telomere to HM loci and rDNA array .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Such relocation of silencing factors enhances gene silencing at HM loci and rDNA array , but diminishes telomeric silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , both Sem1p and Ubp6p participate in the proteolytic function of the proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , we find that <scope type="neg" id="0">the telomeric silencing is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> influenced by proteolysis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , our data demonstrate that Sem1p and Ubp6p maintain telomeric heterochromatin structure ( and hence silencing ) through modulation of histone covalent modifications and association of silencing factors independently of the proteolytic function of the proteasome , thus offering a new regulatory mechanism of telomeric silencing .</sentence>
