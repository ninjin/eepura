<sentence id="0">Erasure of methylation imprinting of Igf2r during mouse primordial germ-cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During germ cell differentiation in mice , the genome undergoes specific epigenetic modifications .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These include demethylation of imprinted genes and subsequent establishment of parental allele-specific methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The mouse Igf2r gene is an imprinted gene that shows maternal-specific expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Maternal-specific methylation of differentially methylated region 2 ( DMR2 ) of this gene <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be necessary for its maternal-specific expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Before the allele-specific methylation is established , DMR2 is demethylated in both male and female primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) by 13.5 days post coitum ( dpc ) , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the demethylation of this region occurs earlier in PGC development</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The timing of the demethylation has been , however , unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In this study , we attempted to determine the timing of methylation erasure of Igf2r DMR2 in developing PGCs , using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein specifically in the germ line .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We purified migrating PGCs from the transgenic mice and examined the methylation status of DMR2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The results show that some CpG sites within DMR2 start demethylation at 9.5 dpc in some migrating PGCs , before the cells colonize genital ridges , and the progression of demethylation is rapid after colonization of the genital ridges .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">To examine <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> the gonadal environment is involved in demethylation</scope> , we analyzed the methylation of DMR2 after culturing migrating PGCs in the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of a gonadal environment</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These culture experiments support the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">idea</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="4">a gonadal environment is <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> required for demethylation of the region in at least a fraction of PGCs</scope></scope> .</sentence>
