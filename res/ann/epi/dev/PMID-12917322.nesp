<sentence id="0">Set2-catalyzed methylation of histone H3 represses basal expression of GAL4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent work has shown that histone methylation is an important regulator of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While much is known about the roles of histone methyltransferases ( HMTs ) in the establishment of heterochromatin , little is known of their roles in the regulation of actively transcribed genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We describe an in vivo role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMT , Set2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We identified SET2 as a gene necessary for repression of GAL4 basal expression and show that the evolutionarily conserved SACI , SACII , and SET domains of Set2 are necessary for this repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We confirm that Set2 catalyzes methylation of lysine 36 on the N-terminal tail of histone H3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conversion of lysine 36 to an unmethylatable arginine causes a decrease in the repression of GAL4 transcription , as does a Delta set2 mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We further show that lysine 36 of histone H3 at GAL4 is methylated and that this methylation is dependent upon the presence of SET2 .</sentence>
