<sentence id="0">RNF8-dependent histone modifications regulate nucleosome removal during spermatogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During spermatogenesis , global nucleosome removal occurs where histones are initially replaced by transition proteins and subsequently by protamines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This chromatin reorganization is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to facilitate the compaction of the paternal genome into the sperm head</scope> and to protect the DNA from damaging agents .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Histone ubiquitination has been <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> to be important for sex chromosome inactivation during meiotic prophase and nucleosome removal at postmeiotic stages</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , the mechanisms regulating these ubiquitin-mediated processes are unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we investigate the role of the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 during spermatogenesis and find that RNF8-deficient mice are proficient in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ( MSCI ) but deficient in global nucleosome removal .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , we show that RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitination induces H4K16 acetylation , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be an initial step in nucleosome removal</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , our results show that RNF8 plays an important role during spermatogenesis through histone ubiquitination , resulting in trans-histone acetylation and global nucleosome removal .</sentence>
