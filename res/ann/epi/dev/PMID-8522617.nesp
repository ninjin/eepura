<sentence id="0">Regulation of CD44 binding to hyaluronan by glycosylation of variably spliced exons .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The hyaluronan (HA)-binding function ( lectin function ) of the leukocyte homing receptor , CD44 , is tightly regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Herein we address <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> mechanisms that regulate CD44 isoform-specific HA binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Binding studies with melanoma transfectants expressing CD44H , CD44E , or with soluble immunoglobulin fusions of CD44H and CD44E ( CD44H-Rg , CD44E-Rg ) showed that although both CD44 isoforms can bind HA , CD44H binds HA more efficiently than CD44E .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using CD44-Rg fusion proteins we show that the variably spliced exons in CD44E , V8-V10 , specifically reduce the lectin function of CD44 , while replacement of V8-V10 by an ICAM-1 immunoglobulin domain restores binding to a level comparable to that of CD44H .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Conversely , CD44 bound HA very weakly when exons V8-V10 were replaced with a CD34 mucin domain , which is heavily modified by O-linked glycans .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Production of CD44E-Rg or incubation of CD44E-expressing transfectants in the presence of an O-linked glycosylation inhibitor restored HA binding to CD44H-Rg and to cell surface CD44H levels , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that differential splicing provides a regulatory mechanism for CD44 lectin function and that this effect is due in part to O-linked carbohydrate moieties which are added to the Ser/Thr rich regions encoded by the variably spliced CD44 exons .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Alternative splicing resulting in changes in protein glycosylation provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of lectin activity .</sentence>
