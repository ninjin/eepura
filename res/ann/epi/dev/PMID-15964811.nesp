<sentence id="0">Histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 is required for transcriptional repression by the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) activities of proteins such as p300 , CBP , and P/CAF play important roles in activation of gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now show that the HAT activity of p300 can also be required for down-regulation of transcription by a DNA binding repressor protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger ( PLZF ) , originally identified as a fusion with retinoic acid receptor alpha in rare cases of all-trans-retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia , is a transcriptional repressor that recruits histone deacetylase-containing corepressor complexes to specific DNA binding sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PLZF associates with p300 in vivo , and its ability to repress transcription is specifically dependent on HAT activity of p300 and acetylation of lysines in its C-terminal C2-H2 zinc finger motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">An acetylation site mutant of PLZF does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> repress transcription</scope> and is functionally deficient in a colony suppression assay despite retaining its abilities to interact with corepressor/histone deacetylase complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This is due to the fact that acetylation of PLZF activates its ability to bind specific DNA sequences both in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> a histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional repressor can be positively regulated through acetylation and point to an unexpected role of a coactivator protein in transcriptional repression</scope> .</sentence>
