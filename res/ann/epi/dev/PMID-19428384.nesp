<sentence id="0">Acetaldehyde stimulates FANCD2 monoubiquitination , H2AX phosphorylation , and BRCA1 phosphorylation in human cells in vitro : implications for alcohol-related carcinogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">According to a recent IARC Working Group report , alcohol consumption is causally related to an increased risk of cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract , liver , colorectum , and female breast [ R. Baan , K. Straif , Y. Grosse , B. Secretan , F. El Ghissassi , V. Bouvard , A. Altieri , V. Cogliano , Carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages , Lancet Oncol .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">8 ( 2007 ) 292-293 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Several lines of evidence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> acetaldehyde ( AA ) , the first product of alcohol metabolism , plays a very important role in alcohol-related carcinogenesis , particularly in the esophagus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We previously <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">proposed</cue> a model for alcohol-related carcinogenesis in which AA , generated from alcohol metabolism , reacts in cells to generate DNA lesions that form interstrand crosslinks ( ICLs ) [ J.A. Theruvathu , P. Jaruga , R.G. Nath , M. Dizdaroglu , P.J. Brooks , Polyamines stimulate the formation of mutagenic 1 , N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts from acetaldehyde , Nucleic Acids Res. 33 ( 2005 ) 3513-3520 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since the Fanconi anemia-breast cancer associated ( FANC-BRCA ) DNA damage response network plays a crucial role in protecting cells against ICLs , in the present work we tested this hypothesis by exposing cells to AA and monitoring activation of this network .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We found that AA exposure results in a concentration-dependent increase in FANCD2 monoubiquitination , which is dependent upon the FANC core complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">AA also stimulated BRCA1 phosphorylation at Ser1524 and increased the level of gammaH2AX , with both modifications occurring in a dose-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , AA did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> detectably increase the levels of hyperphosphorylated RPA34 , a marker of single-stranded DNA exposure at replication forks</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results provide the initial description of the AA-DNA damage response , which is qualitatively similar to the cellular response to mitomycin C , a known DNA crosslinking agent .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We discuss the mechanistic implications of these results , as well as their <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possible</cue> relationship to alcohol-related carcinogenesis in different human tissues</scope> .</sentence>
