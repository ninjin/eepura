<sentence id="0">Ubiquitin-like protein activation by E1 enzymes : the apex for downstream signalling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins ( known as UBLs ) to their targets through multienzyme cascades is a central mechanism to modulate protein functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This process is initiated by a family of mechanistically and structurally related E1 ( or activating ) enzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These activate UBLs through carboxy-terminal adenylation and thiol transfer , and coordinate the use of UBLs in specific downstream pathways by charging cognate E2 ( or conjugating ) enzymes , which then interact with the downstream ubiquitylation machinery to coordinate the modification of the target .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A broad understanding of how E1 enzymes activate UBLs and how they selectively coordinate UBLs with downstream function has come from enzymatic , structural and genetic studies .</sentence>
