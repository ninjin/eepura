<sentence id="0">Characterization of a novel Cullin5 binding domain in HIV-1 Vif .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human immunodeficiency virus tyoe 1 ( HIV-1 ) Vif counteracts host restriction cytidine deaminase ( APOBEC3G ) A3G by co-opting the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome machinery .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Vif utilizes a viral-specific BC-box to recruit ElonginB-ElonginC and a novel zinc-binding HCCH motif to recruit Cullin5 ( Cul5 ) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting A3G for polyubiquitination and subsequently proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine the structural requirements in HIV-1 Vif HCCH motif for Cul5 binding and Vif function , we investigated the arrangement of the His and Cys residues , the role of the spacing between them , and the requirement for the conserved residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our data demonstrate that exchanging Cys for His and vice versa in the highly conserved Zn-coordinating HCCH motif disrupted Vif function and interaction with Cul5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , the maintenance of both conserved residues and spacing within the HCCH motif is critical for Vif function .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have identified a " viral Cul5 box " with consensus Hx2YFxCFx4Phix2APhix7-8Cx5H that is required for Cul5 selection and subsequent A3G degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This novel motif <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> represent a potential new target for anti-viral drug development</scope> .</sentence>
