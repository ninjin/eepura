<sentence id="0">A conserved SET domain methyltransferase , Set11 , modifies ribosomal protein Rpl12 in fission yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">SET domain-containing methyltransferases post-translationally modify a variety of cellular proteins , such as histones , cytochrome c , ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase , and ribosomal proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , at least 13 SET domain-containing proteins have been identified in the genome , four of which are involved in transcriptional regulation through their modification of histone tails .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the roles played by the other SET domain proteins in cellular processes and their physiological substrates remain unresolved .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show here that S. pombe Set11 , a SET domain-containing protein encoded by SPCC1223.04c , specifically modifies Rpl12 ( ribosomal protein L12 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Recombinant Set11 prepared from Escherichia coli had catalytic activity and methylated a 17-kDa polypeptide in cellular extracts of set11 mutant cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The methylated protein was isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or by reverse-phase chromatography and was identified as Rpl12 by mass spectrometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In vitro methylation experiments using wild-type and mutant Rpl12 proteins verified that Set11 modified recombinant Rpl12 and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that its <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> target site</scope> was lysine 3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The methylation site modified by Set11 was also confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis , which also revealed other unique methylation sites of Rpl12 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Finally , we found that Set11 predominantly localized to the nucleolus and that the overproduction of Set11 caused a severe growth defect .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that Rpl12 methylation occurs during the ribosomal assembly processes and that control of the Set11 expression level is important for its cellular function</scope> .</sentence>
