<sentence id="0">Overhydroxylation of lysyl residues is the initial step for altered collagen cross-links and fibril architecture in fibrotic skin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In fibrotic skin of lipodermatosclerosis a substantial increase of the cross-link hydroxylysylpyridinoline is observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Hydroxylysylpyridinoline is a typical cross-link of skeletal tissue and <scope type="spec" id="0"> is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to play a major part in the hardening of sclerotic tissue</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the increase in hydroxylysylpyridinoline is due to overhydroxylation of lysyl residues in the collagen molecule , <scope type="spec" id="2"> which <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> also be associated with an increase of glycosylated hydroxylysine residues</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , we determined <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> the collagen fibrils in lipodermatosclerosis showed a decrease of the diameter in the tissue as well as in vitro after fibrillogenesis of pepsin-solubilized collagens</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Isolated alpha-chains of pepsin solubilized collagen I showed an increase in lysyl hydroxylation ( hyl/(hyl + lys ) ) as compared with normal control [ alpha1(I) : lipodermatosclerosis 0.18 +/- 0.01 ; control 0.12 +/- 0.01 ; alpha2(I) : lipodermatosclerosis 0.36 +/- 0.02 ; control 0 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">25 +/- 0.03 , p < 0.001 ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , the content of enzymatic glycosylated hydroxlysine residues increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This increase is associated with a decrease of fibril diameter of both tissue and fibrils formed in vitro of pepsin-solubilized collagens .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In the same pool of collagens an increase in collagen III content was observed as compared with controls ( lipodermatosclerosis 14.5 % +/- 1.6 , control 10.3 % +/- 1.6 , p < 0.001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our results showed that the overhydroxylation of lysyl residues , which is required for the generation of hydroxylysylpyridinoline , is not only restricted to the telopeptides but also affects the helical part of the molecule .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This process is further associated with an increase of glycosylated hydroxylysyl residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="12"><scope type="spec" id="4"> These changes along with the increase in collagen III content <cue type="spec" id="4">seem</cue> to be responsible for the observed alteration in the architecture of collagen fibrils in sclerotic skin</scope> .</sentence>
