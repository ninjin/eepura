<sentence id="0">A link between secretion and pre-mRNA processing defects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the identification of a novel splicing gene , RSE1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Secretory proteins in eukaryotic cells are transported to the cell surface via the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and the Golgi apparatus by membrane-bounded vesicles .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We screened a collection of temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for defects in ER-to-Golgi transport .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Two of the genes identified in this screen were PRP2 , which encodes a known pre-mRNA splicing factor , and RSE1 , a novel gene that we show to be important for pre-mRNA splicing .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both prp2-13 and rse1-1 mutants accumulate the ER forms of invertase and the vacuolar protease CPY at restrictive temperature .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The secretion defect in each mutant can be suppressed by increasing the amount of SAR1 , which encodes a small GTPase essential for COPII vesicle formation from the ER , or by deleting the intron from the SAR1 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> a <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failure</cue> to splice SAR1 pre-mRNA</scope> is the specific cause of the secretion defects in prp2-13 and rse1-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , these data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">imply</cue> that Sar1p is a limiting component of the ER-to-Golgi transport machinery</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a way that <scope type="spec" id="4"> secretory pathway function <cue type="spec" id="4">might</cue> be coordinated with the amount of gene expression in a cell</scope></scope> .</sentence>
