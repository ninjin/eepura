<sentence id="0">Untargeted tail acetylation of histones in chromatin : lessons from yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Dynamic acetylation of lysine residues in the amino-terminal tails of the core histones is functionally important for the regulation of diverse DNA-dependent processes in the nucleus , including replication , transcription , and DNA repair .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The targeted and untargeted activities of histone lysine acetylases ( KATs ) and deacetylases ( HDACs ) both contribute to the dynamics of chromatin acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While the mechanisms and functional consequences of targeted on histone acetylation are well understood , relatively little is known about untargeted histone acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we review the current understanding of the mechanisms by which untargeted KAT and HDAC activities modulate the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones , focusing on results obtained for H3 and H4 in budding yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also highlight unresolved problems in this area , including the question of how a particular steady-state level of untargeted acetylation is set in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of cis-dependent mechanisms that instruct the activity of KATs and HDACs</scope> .</sentence>
