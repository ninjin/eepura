<sentence id="0">Properties of Nat4 , an N(alpha)-acetyltransferase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that modifies N termini of histones H2A and H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nat4 , also designated NatD , was previously shown to acetylate the N termini of histones H2A and H4 , which have SGGKG and SGRGK N termini ( O. K. Song , X. Wang , J. H. Waterborg , and R. Sternglanz , J. Biol. Chem. 278:38109-38112 , 2003 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The analysis of chimeric proteins with various N-terminal segments of histone H4 fused to iso-1-cytochrome c revealed that efficient acetylation by NatD required at least 30 to 50 amino acid residues of the N terminus of histone H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This requirement for an extended N terminus is in marked contrast with the major N-terminal acetyl transferases ( NATs ) , i.e. , NatA , NatB , and NatC , which require as few as two specific residues and usually <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> more than four or five</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , similar to the other NATs , NatD is associated with ribosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The nat4-Delta strain showed several minor phenotypes , including sensitivity to 3-aminotriazole , benomyl , and thiabendazole .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , these nat4-Delta phenotypes were enhanced in the strain containing K5R K8R K12R replacements in the N-tail of histone H4 , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of N-terminal serine acetylation</scope> is synergistic to the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> of acetylation of the H4 N-tail lysines</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , N-terminal serine acetylation of histone H4 <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be a part of an essential charge patch first described for the histone H2A.Z variant in Tetrahymena species</scope> .</sentence>
