<sentence id="0">Secretion of human epidermal growth factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using synthetic leader sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have investigated different leader sequences for their ability to direct the efficient secretion of human epidermal growth factor ( hEGF ) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We designed a consensus signal sequence which directs secretion of hEGF from yeast as efficiently as the yeast invertase signal sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , secretion is increased over fivefold by the introduction , after the signal sequence , of a synthetic 19-amino acid ( aa ) pro-sequence containing a cleavage recognition site for the KEX2 protease .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Even in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of an Asn-linked glycosylation site</scope> , secretion of hEGF using the synthetic prepro-leader was as efficient as that directed by the alpha-factor leader .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The role of the KEX2 protease cleavage site was investigated by mutation of the yeast alpha-factor KEX2 site ( cleavage after Lys-Arg ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cleavage was obtained with the following order of efficiency , Lys-Arg greater than Pro-Arg greater than Asp-Arg , although the sequence context was also found to affect efficiency .</sentence>
