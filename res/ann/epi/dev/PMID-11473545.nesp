<sentence id="0">Activation of the maternally preset program of apoptosis by microinjection of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate in Xenopus laevis embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The present study examines the effects on embryogenesis of microinjecting Xenopus laevis fertilized eggs with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) , which induces hypomethylation of DNA , and 5-methyl-2'- deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate ( 5-methyl-dCTP ) , which induces hypermethylation of DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Embryos injected with either one of these analogs cleaved normally until the mid-blastula stage , but underwent massive cell dissociation and stopped development at the early gastrula stage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Dissociated cells that appeared here were positive by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick end-labeling and contained fragmented nuclei with condensed chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The DNA from these cells formed a " ladder " on electrophoresis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , the induction of cell dissociation by 5-Aza-CdR and 5-methyl-dCTP was postponed by 2-3 h by co-injection of Bcl-2 mRNA and the normal metabolite ( CdR and dCTP , respectively ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using a specific antibody against 5-methyl-cytosine , we confirmed that 5-Aza-CdR induces hypomethylation , whereas 5-methyl-dCTP induces hypermethylation in X. laevis embryos before the onset of cell dissociation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Incorporation of radioactive precursors revealed that synthesis of DNA , and also RNA , is inhibited significantly in both 5-Aza-CdR-injected and 5-methyl-dCTP-injected embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results show that 5-Aza-CdR and 5-methyl-dCTP are incorporated into DNA and induce apoptosis , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">probably</cue> through alteration of DNA methylation coupled with inhibition of DNA replication and/or transcription</scope> .</sentence>
