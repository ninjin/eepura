Porcine submaxillary mucin forms disulfide-linked multimers through its amino-terminal D-domains. 
COS-7 cells expressing 1,360 residues from the amino terminus of porcine submaxillary mucin were used to determine whether this region, containing the D1, D2, and D3 domains, is involved in forming mucin multimers. Analysis of the proteins immunoprecipitated from the medium of transfected cells by reducing SDS-gel electrophoresis showed a single N-glycosylated protein with no indication of proteolytically processed forms. Without prior reduction, only two proteins, corresponding to monomeric and disulfide-linked trimeric species, were observed. The expressed protein devoid of N-linked oligosaccharides also formed trimers, but was secreted from cells in significantly less amounts than glycosylated trimers. Pulse-chase studies showed that the disulfide-linked trimers were assembled inside the cells no earlier than 30 min after protein synthesis commenced and after the intracellular precursors were N-glycosylated. Trimer formation was inhibited in cells treated with brefeldin A, monensin, chloroquine, or bafilomycin A1, although only brefeldin A prevented the secretion of the protein. These results suggest that trimerization takes place in compartments of the Golgi complex in which the vacuolar H+-ATPase maintains an acidic pH. Coexpression in the same cells of the amino-terminal region and the disulfide-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of the mucin showed that these structures were not disulfide-linked with one another. Cells expressing a DNA construct encoding a fusion protein between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the mucin secreted disulfide-linked dimeric and high molecular weight multimeric species of the recombinant mucin. The presence of monensin in the medium was without effect on dimerization, but inhibited the formation of disulfide-linked multimers. These studies suggest that disulfide-linked dimers of mucin are subsequently assembled into disulfide-linked multimers by the amino-terminal regions. They also suggest that the porcine mucin forms branched disulfide-linked multimers. This ability of the amino-terminal region of mucin to aid in the assembly of multimers is consistent with its amino acid identities to the amino-terminal region of human von Willebrand factor, which also serves to form disulfide-linked multimers of this protein.
