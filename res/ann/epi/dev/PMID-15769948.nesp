<sentence id="0">DNA methylation-related chromatin modification in the regulation of mouse delta-opioid receptor gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">DNA methylation plays critical roles in gene-silencing through chromatin modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We reported previously that promoter-region CpG methylation repressed mouse delta-opioid receptor ( mDOR ) gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the current study , we demonstrated that the methylation of mDOR gene promoter is correlated with a repressive chromatin structure that has less HaeIII and MspI nuclear accessibility and more deacetylated histone H3 and H4 than that of unmethylated mDOR promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the association of a methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 ( MBD2 ) with methylated mDOR promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transient expression of MBD2 enhanced the repression of partially methylated mDOR promoter activity , and this repression was partially reversed by treatment of trichostatin A , a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> MBD2 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> mediate DNA methylation-related chromatin modification through recruiting histone deacetylases to mDOR promoter region</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , trichostatin A treatment increased both methylated mDOR promoter activity in a transient transfection assay and endogenous mDOR mRNA level in Neuro2A cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , these results demonstrate that the mDOR gene expression is regulated by DNA methylation-related chromatin modification , especially histone acetylation and deacetylation .</sentence>
