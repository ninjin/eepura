<sentence id="0">Genetics and epigenetics in flower pigmentation associated with transposable elements in morning glories .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Among the genus Ipomoea , three morning glories , I. nil ( the Japanese morning glory ) , I. purpurea ( the common morning glory ) , and I. tricolor , were domesticated well for floricultural plants , and many spontaneous mutants displaying various flower pigmentation patterns were isolated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Most of these spontaneous mutations were found to be caused by the insertion of DNA transposable elements in the genes for the anthocyanin pigmentation in flowers , and many of them exhibited variegated flowers , such as white flowers with pigmented spots and sectors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we describe the historical background of the mutants displaying variegated flowers and review the genetic and epigenetic regulation in flower pigmentation associated with transposable elements of these morning glories .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The flecked , speckled , r-1 , and purple mutations in I. nil were caused by insertions of Tpn1 and its relatives in the En/Spm superfamily , Tpn2 , Tpn3 , and Tpn4 , into the genes for anthocyanin coloration in flowers , i.e. , DFR-B , CHI , CHS-D , and InNHX1 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Similarly , the flaked and pink mutants of I. purpurea have distantly related elements , Tip100 and Tip201 , in the Ac/Ds superfamily inserted into the CHS-D and F3'H genes , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The flower variegation patterns can be determined by the frequency and timing of the excision of these transposons , and their stable insertions produce plain color flowers without generating pigmented spots or sectors ; furthermore , <scope type="spec" id="0"> both genetic and epigenetic regulation <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to play important roles in determining the frequency and timing of the excision of the transposons</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , flower variegation is not always associated with the excision of an integrated DNA transposon from one of the genes for anthocyanin pigmentation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The mutant Flying Saucers of I. tricolor displaying variegated flowers was found to have the transposon ItMULE1 inserted into the DFR-B promoter region , but no excision of ItMULE1 from the DFR-B could be detected in the variegated flower lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The instable pearly-vrg allele in cv .</sentence>
<sentence id="10"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Flying Saucers is <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to be an epiallele because <scope type="spec" id="2"> the DNA methylation in the DFR-B promoter <cue type="spec" id="2">appeared</cue> to be associated with flower pigmentation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
