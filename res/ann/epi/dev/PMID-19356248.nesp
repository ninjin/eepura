<sentence id="0">Histone acetylations mark origins of polycistronic transcription in Leishmania major .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Many components of the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery have been identified in kinetoplastid protozoa , but they diverge substantially from other eukaryotes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Furthermore , protein-coding genes in these organisms <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> individual transcriptional regulation</scope> , since they are transcribed as long polycistronic units .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The transcription initiation sites are assumed to lie within the ' divergent strand-switch ' regions at the junction between opposing polycistronic gene clusters .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the mechanism by which Kinetoplastidae initiate transcription is <cue type="spec" id="1">unclear</cue></scope> , and promoter sequences are undefined .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RESULTS : The chromosomal location of TATA-binding protein ( TBP or TRF4 ) , Small Nuclear Activating Protein complex ( SNAP50 ) , and H3 histones were assessed in Leishmania major using microarrays hybridized with DNA obtained through chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP-chip ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The TBP and SNAP50 binding patterns were almost identical and high intensity peaks were associated with tRNAs and snRNAs .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Only 184 peaks of acetylated H3 histone were found in the entire genome , with substantially higher intensity in rapidly-dividing cells than stationary-phase .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The majority of the acetylated H3 peaks were found at divergent strand-switch regions , but some occurred at chromosome ends and within polycistronic gene clusters .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Almost all these peaks were associated with lower intensity peaks of TBP/SNAP50 binding a few kilobases upstream , evidence that they represent transcription initiation sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSION : The first genome-wide maps of DNA-binding protein occupancy in a kinetoplastid organism <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that H3 histones at the origins of polycistronic transcription of protein-coding genes are acetylated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="spec" id="3"> Global regulation of transcription initiation <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be achieved by modifying the acetylation state of these origins</scope> .</sentence>
