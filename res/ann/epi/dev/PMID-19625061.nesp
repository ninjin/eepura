<sentence id="0">Multicenter evaluation of an investigational prostate cancer methylation assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PURPOSE : Prostate specific antigen tests have low specificity , which frequently results in unnecessary biopsy and typically limits screening to patients with prostate specific antigen greater than 4.0 ng/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We evaluated an investigational prostate cancer methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay that detects aberrant methylation in 3 markers ( GSTP1 , RARbeta2 and APC ) that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate</cue> the presence of prostate cancer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">MATERIALS AND METHODS : The assay was evaluated in 337 post-digital rectal examination urine samples ( 178 cancer and 159 noncancer ) collected prospectively at a total of 9 clinical sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Samples were processed wholly or after division into equal portions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Subject prostate specific antigen was 2.0 to 10.0 ng/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">All subjects underwent transrectal ultrasound guided needle biopsy with 6 or greater cores sampled .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Detection of 1 or greater markers <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated</cue> positivity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">RESULTS : Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay performance was better in whole than in divided urine cohorts ( p = 0.035 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Assay AUC was 0.72 in the whole urine cohort and 0.67 in the combined population .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These values were higher than those of prostate specific antigen alone using 4.0 ng/ml as the cutoff ( p = 0.00 and 0.01 , respectively ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Moreover , the assay together with the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator or a standard nomogram significantly improved AUC in the whole urine cohort and the combined population vs predictive algorithms alone ( p < 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Assay positive predictive value was 54 % in whole urine cohort with prostate specific antigen 2.0 to 4.0 ng/ml and negative predictive value was 87 % with prostate specific antigen 4.1 to 10.0 ng/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Assay positive predictive value was higher in subjects with all 3 methylation markers positive .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that this investigational assay used in conjunction with current screening algorithms <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potentially</cue> add value to the biopsy decision making process</scope></scope> .</sentence>
