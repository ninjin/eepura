<sentence id="0">Comparison of the immune response to variant influenza type B hemagglutinins expressed in vaccinia virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To compare the immune response induced by influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) variants differing by a single amino acid , the genes for each HA variant were cloned and expressed in vaccinia virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These variant HA genes have been previously described as being present exclusively in either egg-derived or MDCK cell-derived subpopulations of influenza B/England/222/82 virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By using this approach we were able to vaccinate animals with homogeneous preparations of these viral antigens and thus circumvent the problem of heterogeneity within RNA virus stocks .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Immunization and challenge experiments in mice <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> even though vaccination with the recombinant vaccinia viruses induced different levels of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies , mice vaccinated with either recombinant vaccinia virus were protected from infection with either subpopulation of influenza virus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Results with this model system support the view that influenza vaccines prepared with egg-derived virus <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> be protective against microvariants of virus that grow preferentially in MDCK and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibly</cue> other mammalian cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
