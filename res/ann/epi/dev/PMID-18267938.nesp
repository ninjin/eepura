<sentence id="2">The present experiments were carried out to characterize the molecular interaction between fibulin-5 and tropoelastin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our data showed that the divalent cations of Ca(2+) , Ba(2+) and Mg(2+) significantly enhanced the binding of fibulin-5 to tropoelastin .</sentence>

<sentence id="5">To address the fibulin-5 binding site on tropoelastin constructs containing , exons 2-15 and exons 16-36 , of tropoelastin were used .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Fibulin-5 binding was significantly reduced to either fragment and also to a mixture of the two fragments .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that the whole molecule of tropoelastin was required for the interaction with fibulin-5</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In co-immunoprecipitation experiments , tropoelastin binding to fibulin-5 was enhanced by an increase of temperature and sodium chloride concentration , conditions that enhance the coacervation of tropoelastin .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The binding of tropoelastin fragments to fibulin-5 was directly proportional to their propensity to coacervate .</sentence>
