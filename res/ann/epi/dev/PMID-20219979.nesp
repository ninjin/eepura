<sentence id="0">Glioma pathogenesis-related 1-like 1 is testis enriched , dynamically modified , and redistributed during male germ cell maturation and has a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> role</scope> in sperm-oocyte binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The glioma pathogenesis-related 1 ( GLIPR1 ) family consists of three genes [ GLIPR1 , GLIPR1-like 1 ( GLIPR1L1 ) , and GLIPR1-like 2 ( GLIPR1L2 ) ] and forms a distinct subgroup within the cysteine-rich secretory protein ( CRISP ) , antigen 5 , and pathogenesis-related 1 ( CAP ) superfamily .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CAP superfamily proteins are found in phyla ranging from plants to humans and , based largely on expression and limited functional studies , <scope type="spec" id="1"> are <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesized</cue> to have roles in carcinogenesis , immunity , cell adhesion , and male fertility</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Specifically data from a number of systems <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that sequences within the C-terminal CAP domain of CAP proteins have the ability to promote cell-cell adhesion</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Herein we cloned mouse Glipr1l1 and have shown it has a testis-enriched expression profile .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">GLIPR1L1 is posttranslationally modified by N-linked glycosylation during spermatogenesis and ultimately becomes localized to the connecting piece of elongated spermatids and sperm .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">After sperm capacitation , however , GLIPR1L1 is also localized to the anterior regions of the sperm head .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Zona pellucida binding assays <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> GLIPR1L1 has a role in the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida surrounding the oocyte</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that , along with other members of the CAP superfamily and several other proteins , GLIPR1L1 is involved in the binding of sperm to the oocyte complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Collectively these data further strengthen the role of CAP domain-containing proteins in cellular adhesion and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">propose</cue> a mechanism whereby CAP proteins show overlapping functional significance during fertilization</scope> .</sentence>
