<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Groundwater contaminated with arsenic imposes a big challenge to human health worldwide .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using natural compounds to subvert the detrimental effects of arsenic represents an attractive strategy .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) is a critical regulator of the cellular antioxidant response and xenobiotic metabolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recently , activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway has been reported to confer protection against arsenic-induced toxicity in a cell culture model .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">OBJECTIVES : The goal of the present work was to identify a potent Nrf2 activator from plants as a chemopreventive compound and to demonstrate the efficacy of the compound in battling arsenic-induced toxicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : Oridonin activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway at a low subtoxic dose and was able to stabilize Nrf2 by blocking Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation , leading to accumulation of the Nrf2 protein and activation of the Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective response .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pretreatment of UROtsa cells with 1.4 muM oridonin significantly enhanced the cellular redox capacity , reduced formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , and improved cell survival after arsenic challenge .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">CONCLUSIONS : We identified oridonin as representing a novel class of Nrf2 activators and illustrated the mechanism by which the Nrf2 pathway is activated .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , we demonstrated the feasibility of using natural compounds targeting Nrf2 as a therapeutic approach to protect humans from various environmental insults that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> occur daily</scope> .</sentence>
