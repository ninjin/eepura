<sentence id="0">A critical role for CHIP in the aggresome pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent evidence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that aggresome formation is a physiologic stress response not limited to misfolded proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">That stress response , termed " physiologic aggresome , " is exemplified by aggresome formation of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , an important host defense protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">CHIP ( carboxy terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein ) is a highly conserved protein that has been shown to mediate substrate ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we show that CHIP has a previously unexpected critical role in the aggresome pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">CHIP interacts with iNOS and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome as well as its sequestration to the aggresome .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CHIP-mediated iNOS targeting to the proteasome sequentially precedes CHIP-mediated iNOS sequestration to the aggresome .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">CHIP is required for iNOS preaggresome structures to form a mature aggresome .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , CHIP is required for targeting the mutant form of cystic fibrosis transconductance regulator ( CFTRDeltaF508 ) to the aggresome .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Importantly , the ubiquitin ligase function of CHIP is required in targeting preaggresomal structures to the aggresome by promoting an iNOS interaction with histone deacetylase 6 , which serves as an adaptor between ubiquitinated proteins and the dynein motor .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This study reveals a critical role for CHIP in the aggresome pathway .</sentence>
