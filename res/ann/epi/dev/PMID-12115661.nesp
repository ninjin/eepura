<sentence id="0">Reversal of tolerance induced by transplantation of skin expressing the immunodominant T cell epitope of rat type II collagen entitles development of collagen-induced arthritis but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> graft rejection</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) is induced in H-2(q) mice after immunization with rat type II collagen ( CII ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The immunodominant T cell epitope on heterologous CII has been located to CII256-270 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have previously shown that TSC transgenic mice , which express the heterologous epitope in type I collagen ( CI ) , e.g. in skin , are tolerized against rat CII and resistant to CIA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study we transplanted skin from TSC transgenic mice onto non-transgenic CIA-susceptible littermates to investigate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> introduction of this epitope to a naive immune system <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">would</cue> lead to T cell priming and graft rejection or instead to tolerance and arthritis protection</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , TSC grafts were accepted and not even immunization of recipient mice with CII in adjuvant induced graft rejection .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Instead , TSC skin recipients displayed a reduced T and B cell response to CII and were also protected from arthritis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , additional priming could break arthritis protection and was accompanied by an increased T cell response to the grafted epitope .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Strikingly , despite the regained T cell response , <scope type="neg" id="3">development of arthritis was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> accompanied by graft rejection</scope> , showing that these immune-mediated inflammatory responses involve different mechanisms .</sentence>
