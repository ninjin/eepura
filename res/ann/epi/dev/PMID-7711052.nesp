<sentence id="0">The effects of variable glycosylation on the functional activities of ribonuclease , plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The relatively large size and dynamics of oligosaccharides can result in substantial shielding of functionally important areas of proteins to which they are attached , modulate the interactions of glycoconjugates with other molecules and affect the rate of processes which involve conformational changes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This review focuses on the occupancy of N-linked glycosylation sites on three enzymes , ribonuclease , plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Each of these proteins occurs naturally as two populations of molecules , distinguished from each other only by the presence or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of an oligosaccharide at one glycosylation site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The presence of an oligomannose sugar on ribonuclease ( at Asn-34 ) alters its overall dynamics , increases its stability towards proteinases and decreases its functional activity towards double-stranded RNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The N-linked sugar on plasminogen ( at Asn-288 ) within kringle 3 reduces the rate of the beta- to alpha-conformational change , modulates the transport of plasminogen into the extravascular compartment , decreases plasminogen binding to U937 cells and downregulates the activation of plasminogen by both urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , in fibrinolysis , within a ternary complex of fibrin , plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator , the N-linked sugar of plasminogen hinders the initial interaction with tissue plasminogen activator ( i.e. , it alters Km ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The presence of an N-linked glycan ( at Asn-184 ) in the kringle 2 domain of tissue plasminogen activator hinders the rearrangement of this ternary complex , decreasing the turnover rate ( Kcat ) .</sentence>
