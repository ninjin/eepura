<sentence id="0">Role and regulation of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-alpha subunits by prolyl hydroxylase domain ( PHD ) proteins signals their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation , and plays a critical role in regulating HIF abundance and oxygen homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While oxygen concentration plays a major role in determining the efficiency of PHD-catalyzed hydroxylation reactions , many other environmental and intracellular factors also significantly modulate PHD activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , PHDs <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> also employ hydroxylase-independent mechanisms to modify HIF activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , while PHDs regulate HIF-alpha protein stability , PHD2 and PHD3 themselves are subject to feedback upregulation by HIFs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Functionally , different PHD isoforms <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> differentially contribute to specific pathophysiological processes , including angiogenesis , erythropoiesis , tumorigenesis , and cell growth , differentiation and survival</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Because of diverse roles of PHDs in many different processes , loss of PHD expression or function triggers multi-faceted pathophysiological changes as has been shown in mice <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacking</cue> different PHD isoforms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Future investigations are needed to explore in vivo specificity of PHDs over different HIF-alpha subunits and differential roles of PHD isoforms in different biological processes .</sentence>
