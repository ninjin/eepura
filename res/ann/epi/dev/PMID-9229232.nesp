<sentence id="0">Study of biochemical substrate and role of metalloproteinases in fascia transversalis from hernial processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The aim of this study was to examine the fascia transversalis ( FT ) from patients with direct and indirect hernia in an attempt to identify <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> differences between each type of hernia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">FT samples were obtained from 36 patients presenting inguinal hernia ( 23 indirect hernia and 13 direct hernia ) who underwent surgery .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have analysed the ultrastructure of the fascia surrounding the hernial lesions , the proline and lysine hydroxylation in the tissue , the type I-type III collagen ratio and the presence of metalloproteinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> detected ultrastructural differences in the collagen fibrils from FT in direct and indirect hernias</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">However</cue> , the interfibrillar matrix was more abundant in direct hernias</scope> , showing abundant electron-dense particles .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">No</cue> differences in proline hydroxylation were observed between each type of hernia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A small decrease in lysine hydroxylation was detected in patients with direct hernia .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs ) showed <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> statistically significant differences in the type I-type III collagen absorbance ratios</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Immunohistochemistry revealed <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> differences in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">FT from patients presenting direct hernia showed a very strong staining vs. metalloproteinase-2 when compared with that observed in indirect hernia .</sentence>
