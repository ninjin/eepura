<sentence id="0">Kaposi 's sarcoma herpesvirus-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen stabilizes intracellular activated Notch by targeting the Sel10 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Deregulation of the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling is highly correlated with oncogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Intracellular activated Notch ( ICN ) is a protooncogene linked to the transcription activation of a number of cellular genes involved in cell cycle regulation , differentiation , and proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Stability of ICN is tightly regulated by the Sel10-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sel10 can function as a negative regulator of Notch and exhibits activities of a tumor-suppressor protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This article shows that the Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) latency-associated nuclear antigen ( LANA ) directly interacts with Sel10 and forms a complex in KSHV-infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This results in suppression of ICN ubiquitination and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The carboxyl terminus of LANA interacts with the F-box and WD40 domains of Sel10 and competes with ICN for binding to Sel10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This elevated level of ICN is also critical for maintaining the enhanced proliferation of KSHV-infected tumor cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings describe a mechanism by which the KSHV-encoded LANA protein regulates ubiquitination of ICN mediated by the F-box component of the E3 ligase Sel10 , leading to proliferation of the virus-infected cells .</sentence>
