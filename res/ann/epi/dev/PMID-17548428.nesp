<sentence id="0">Mechanisms of ceramide-mediated repression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter via deacetylation of Sp3 by histone deacetylase 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this study , distinct roles of de novo-generated endogenous ceramides and mechanisms by which deacetylated Sp3 regulates the hTERT promoter activity in response to ceramide signaling were explored .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The generation of C18-ceramide via the expression of ceramide synthase 1 ( CerS1 ) , and not C16-ceramide by CerS5 or CerS6 expression , resulted in repression of the hTERT promoter via deacetylation of Sp3 by histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1 ) in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Then roles and mechanisms of action of ceramide-mediated deacetylation of Sp3 in inhibiting the hTERT promoter were determined using constitutively deacetylated or acetylated Sp3 mutants at lysine ( K ) 551 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Expression of the deacetylated Sp3 mutant resulted in repression , whereas its acetylated mutant induced basal hTERT promoter activity in Drosophila S2 cells , which do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> express any endogenous Sp3</scope> , and in A549 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Remarkably , chromatin immunoprecipitation data revealed that acetylated Sp3 mutant ( K551Q-Sp3 ) did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> bind whereas deacetylated Sp3 ( K551R-Sp3 ) mutant bound strongly to the promoter DNA</scope> , resulting in the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1 ) and inhibition of the association of RNA polymerase II with the promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mechanistically , increased generation of C18-ceramide by hCerS1 expression , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> by its catalytically inactive mutant</scope> , mediated the association and recruitment of the deacetylated Sp3/HDAC1 complex to the hTERT promoter DNA , resulting in the local histone H3 deacetylation and repression of the promoter .</sentence>
