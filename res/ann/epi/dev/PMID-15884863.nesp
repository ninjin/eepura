<sentence id="0">Interactions of whey proteins during heat treatment of oil-in-water emulsions formed with whey protein isolate and hydroxylated lecithin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The interactions of proteins during the heat treatment of whey-protein-isolate (WPI)-based oil-in-water emulsions with and <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> added hydroxylated lecithin were studied by examining the changes in droplet size distribution and the quantity and type of adsorbed and unadsorbed proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Heat treatment at 90 degrees C of WPI emulsions resulted in an increase in total adsorbed protein ; unadsorbed beta-lactoglobulin ( beta-lg ) was the main protein interacting with the adsorbed proteins during the first 10 min of heating , but after this time , unadsorbed alpha-lactalbumin ( alpha-la ) also associated with the adsorbed protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In emulsions containing hydroxylated lecithin , the increase in total adsorbed protein during heat treatment was much lower and <scope type="spec" id="2"> the unadsorbed beta-lg did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to interact with the adsorbed proteins during heating</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , the behavior of alpha-la during heat treatment of these emulsions was similar to that observed in the emulsions containing <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> hydroxylated lecithin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the presence of NaCl , the particle size of the emulsion droplets and the quantities of adsorbed protein increased markedly during heating .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Emulsions containing hydroxylated lecithin were less sensitive to the addition of NaCl .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the binding of hydroxylated lecithin to unfolded monomers or intermediate products of beta-lg reduces the extent of heat-induced aggregation of beta-lg</scope> and consequently decreases the interactions between unadsorbed beta-lg and adsorbed protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) of heated whey protein and hydroxylated lecithin solutions .</sentence>
