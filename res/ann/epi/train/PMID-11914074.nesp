<sentence id="0">Co- and posttranslational modification of the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor : effects on receptor expression and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have characterized the maturation , co- and posttranslational modifications , and functional properties of the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor ( AR ) expressed in different mammalian cells transfected using conventional approaches or the Semliki Forest virus system .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found that the alpha(1B)-AR undergoes N-linked glycosylation as demonstrated by its sensitivity to endoglycosidases and by the effect of tunicamycin on receptor maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pulse-chase labeling experiments in BHK-21 cells demonstrate that the alpha(1B)-AR is synthesized as a 70 kDa core glycosylated precursor that is converted to the 90 kDa mature form of the receptor with a half-time of approximately 2 h. N-Linked glycosylation of the alpha(1B)-AR occurs at four asparagines on the N-terminus of the receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutations of the N-linked glycosylation sites did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> have a significant effect on receptor function or expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Surprisingly , receptor mutants <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacking</cue> N-linked glycosylation</scope> migrated as heterogeneous bands in SDS-PAGE .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our findings demonstrate that N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> palmitoylation or O-linked glycosylation</scope> , contribute to the structural heterogeneity of the alpha(1B)-AR as it is observed in SDS-PAGE .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The modifications found are similar in the different mammalian expression systems explored .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> the Semliki Forest virus system can provide large amounts of functional and fully glycosylated alpha(1B)-AR protein suitable for biochemical and structural studies</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The results of this study contribute to elucidate the basic steps involved in the processing of G protein-coupled receptors as well as to optimize strategies for their overexpression .</sentence>
