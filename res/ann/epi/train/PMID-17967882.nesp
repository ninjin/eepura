<sentence id="0">Certain and progressive methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 during the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 ( K20 ) has been implicated in transcriptional activation , gene silencing , heterochromatin formation , mitosis , and DNA repair .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , little is known about how this modification is regulated or how it contributes to these diverse processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Metabolic labeling and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized H4 is progressively methylated at K20 during the G(2) , M , and G(1) phases of the cell cycle in a process that is largely inescapable and irreversible .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Approximately 98 % of new H4 becomes dimethylated within two to three cell cycles , and K20 methylation turnover in vivo is undetectable .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">New H4 is methylated regardless of prior acetylation , and acetylation occurs predominantly on K20-dimethylated H4 , refuting the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesis</cue> that K20 methylation antagonizes H4 acetylation and represses transcription epigenetically</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Despite <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggestions</cue> that it is required for normal mitosis and cell cycle progression , K20 methylation</scope> proceeds normally during colchicine treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , delays in PR-Set7 synthesis and K20 methylation which accompany altered cell cycle progression during sodium butyrate treatment <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">appear</cue> to be secondary to histone hyperacetylation or other effects of butyrate since depletion of PR-Set7 did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affect cell cycle progression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , our data provide an unbiased perspective of the regulation and function of K20 methylation .</sentence>
