<sentence id="0">Impaired lysosomal trimming of N-linked oligosaccharides leads to hyperglycosylation of native lysosomal proteins in mice with alpha-mannosidosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Alpha-mannosidosis is caused by the genetic defect of the lysosomal alpha-d-mannosidase ( LAMAN ) , which is involved in the breakdown of free alpha-linked mannose-containing oligosaccharides originating from glycoproteins with N-linked glycans , and thus manifests itself in an extensive storage of mannose-containing oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we demonstrate in a model of mice with alpha-mannosidosis that native lysosomal proteins exhibit elongated N-linked oligosaccharides as shown by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis , deglycosylation assays , and mass spectrometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The analysis of cathepsin B-derived oligosaccharides revealed a hypermannosylation of glycoproteins in mice with alpha-mannosidosis as indicated by the predominance of extended Man3GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Treatment with recombinant human alpha-mannosidase partially corrected the hyperglycosylation of lysosomal proteins in vivo and in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These data clearly demonstrate that LAMAN is involved not only in the lysosomal catabolism of free oligosaccharides but also in the trimming of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides on native lysosomal proteins .</sentence>
