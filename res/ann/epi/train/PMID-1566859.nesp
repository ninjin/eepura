<sentence id="0">Expression and transport of rabbit surfactant protein A in COS-1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">SV40-transformed green monkey kidney ( COS-1 ) cells were transfected with expression plasmids that contained either the structural gene or cDNA for surfactant protein A ( SP-A ) , a major protein of rabbit lung surfactant .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The transfected COS-1 cells synthesized several isoforms of SP-A that were found to be less acidic than those produced in rabbit lung tissue .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">SP-A species with apparent molecular weight ( M(r) ) approximately equal to 29,000-33,000 were detected in the transfected cells , whereas glycosylated forms with apparent M(r) approximately equal to 33,000-38,000 were detectable only in the culture medium .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis of transfected cells by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that SP-A was localized in punctate bodies throughout the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expressed SP-A was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detectable on the cell surface</scope> <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">nor</cue> was there evidence that secreted SP-A was endocytosed by COS-1 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">After subcellular fractionation of the transfected COS-1 cells , SP-A was found to be localized predominantly in the 5,000- and 18,000-g pellet fractions ; little or <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> immunoreactive SP-A was detectable in cytosolic fractions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Treatment of transfected cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin prevented secretion of SP-A into the medium , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> a role of glycosylation in secretion of SP-A</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">On the other hand , treatment of transfected cells with inhibitors of proline hydroxylation , which <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> cause destabilization of the collagen-like domain of SP-A</scope> , reduced but did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> prevent secretion of SP-A into the culture medium</scope> .</sentence>
