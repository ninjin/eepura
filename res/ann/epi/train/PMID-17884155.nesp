<sentence id="0">Selective anchoring of TFIID to nucleosomes by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 ( H3K4me3 ) is regarded as a hallmark of active human promoters , but it remains <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue> how this posttranslational modification links to transcriptional activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomic screening we show that the basal transcription factor TFIID directly binds to the H3K4me3 mark via the plant homeodomain ( PHD ) finger of TAF3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Selective loss of H3K4me3 reduces transcription from and TFIID binding to a subset of promoters in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Equilibrium binding assays and competition experiments show that the TAF3 PHD finger is highly selective for H3K4me3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In transient assays , TAF3 can act as a transcriptional coactivator in a PHD finger-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 selectively inhibits TFIID binding to H3K4me3 , whereas acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 potentiates TFIID interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our experiments reveal crosstalk between histone modifications and the transcription factor TFIID .</sentence>
