<sentence id="0">Altered nucleosomes of active nucleolar chromatin contain accessible histone H3 in its hyperacetylated forms .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chromatin of the organism Physarum polycephalum contains a class of conformationally altered nucleosomes previously localized to the transcribing regions of ribosomal genes in nucleoli .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">When nuclei are treated with 2-iodo[2-tritium]acetate , the histone H3 sulfhydryl group of the altered nucleosomes is derivatized while that of folded nucleosomes is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> , and the labeled histones can then be identified by autoradiography of gels that separate H3 isoforms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The H3 derivatized is predominantly of tri- and tetraacetylated forms .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , total free histone reacted with iodoacetate shows <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> preferential labeling of isoforms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Selective reaction of acetylated H3 is prevalent in both nucleolar and non-nucleolar chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results link specific patterns of H3 acetylation to changes in nucleosome conformation that occur during transcription .</sentence>
