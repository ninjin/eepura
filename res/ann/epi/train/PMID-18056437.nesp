<sentence id="0">Direct transcriptional activation of promyelocytic leukemia protein by IFN regulatory factor 3 induces the p53-dependent growth inhibition of cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IFN regulatory factor 3 ( IRF3 ) is a transcriptional factor that plays a crucial role in activation of innate immunity and inflammation in response to viral infection , and is also involved in p53-dependent inhibition of cell growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although functional activation of IRF3 by viral infection is relatively well documented , the biological role and regulatory mechanism underlying cell growth inhibition by IRF3 are poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show a novel regulatory pathway connecting IRF3-promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)-p53 in primary and cancer cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Overexpression of IRF3 induces p53-dependent cell growth inhibition in cancer cell lines with normal p53 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , doxycycline-induced expression of IRF3 in U87MG cells inhibits tumor growth in nude mice in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">IRF3 is found to increase expression of PML by a direct transcriptional activation as determined by PML-promoter-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">When PML is depleted by RNA interference-mediated knockdown , IRF3 <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">fails</cue> to increase p53 acetylation and its transcriptional activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , the results of the present study <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> direct transcriptional activation of PML by IRF3 results in the p53-dependent growth inhibition of normal and cancer cells in vitro and in vivo , which is <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggestive</cue> of a novel regulatory network between the innate immune response and tumor suppression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
