<sentence id="0">Synergism of Xist RNA , DNA methylation , and histone hypoacetylation in maintaining X chromosome inactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Xist RNA expression , methylation of CpG islands , and hypoacetylation of histone H4 are distinguishing features of inactive X chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that these silencing mechanisms act synergistically to maintain the inactive state .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Xist RNA has been shown to be essential for initiation of X inactivation , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for maintenance</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have developed a system in which the reactivation frequency of individual X-linked genes can be assessed quantitatively .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using a conditional mutant Xist allele , we provide direct evidence for that loss of Xist RNA destabilizes the inactive state in somatic cells , leading to an increased reactivation frequency of an X-linked GFP transgene and of the endogenous hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( Hprt ) gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Demethylation of DNA , using 5-azadC or by introducing a mutation in Dnmt1 , and inhibition of histone hypoacetylation using trichostatin A further increases reactivation in Xist mutant fibroblasts , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating</cue> a synergistic interaction of X chromosome silencing mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
