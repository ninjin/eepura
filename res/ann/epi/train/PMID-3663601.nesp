<sentence id="0">Distinguishing among protein kinases by substrate specificities .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In the previous paper , N-methylated peptides were shown to be sensitive probes of substrate conformation within the adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate dependent protein kinase ( A-kinase ) active site .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While it has been shown that other protein kinases will catalyze the phosphorylation of the same peptide sequences as A-kinase , there is as yet little information as to <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the protein kinases differentiate between substrates on the basis of conformation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For this reason , the conformationally restricted N-methylated peptides were used to probe the active site of guanosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate dependent protein kinase ( G-kinase ) , which is homologous in sequence to [ Takio , K. , Wade , R. D. , Smith , S. B. , Krebs , E. G. , Walsh , K. A. , & Titani , K. ( 1984 ) Biochemistry 23 , 4207-4218 ] and which has substrate specificities similar to [ Lincoln , T. M. , & Corbin , J. D. ( 1977 ) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74 , 3239-3243 ] those of A-kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although <scope type="spec" id="1"> this enzyme <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to bind the peptides in a conformation resembling that of conformation A</scope> , it is more able to accommodate backbone methylation than is A-kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A peptide substrate at least 700-fold selective for G-kinase over A-kinase was found .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Backbone methylation <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> , therefore , represent a way of making peptide substrates and inhibitors selective for a particular kinase</scope> .</sentence>
