<sentence id="0">Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 CRF07_BC strains circulating in the Xinjiang Province of China .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : HIV-1 CRF07_BC recombinant previously circulated mainly among the intravenous drug users ( IDUs ) in Xinjiang province of China and is currently spreading in the entire country .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The aim of this study is to characterize the genotypic and phenotypic properties of HIV-1 CRF07_BC isolates in comparison with those of the subtype B ' ( Thailand B ) which is prevalent in the former plasma donors ( FPDs ) in China .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">RESULTS : Twelve HIV-1 CRF07_BC variants were isolated from the blood of the HIV-1-infected IDUs in Xinjiang province , and 20 subtype B ' isolates were obtained from the FPDs in Anhui and Shanxi provinces of China .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">All the CRF07_BC viruses utilized CCR5 co-receptor , whereas 12 subtype B ' viruses were R5-tropic , and the remaining B ' isolates were dual ( R5X4 ) tropic .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">CRF07_BC viruses had lower net charge value in the V3 loop and exhibited slower replication kinetics than subtype B ' viruses .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The number and location of the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> N-linked glycosylation sites</scope> in V1/V2 and the C2 region of the CRF07_BC viruses were significantly different from those of the subtype B ' viruses .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">CONCLUSION : The HIV-1 CRF07_BC recombinant strains with relatively lower net charges in the V3 loop exclusively utilize CCR5 co-receptor for infection and exhibit slow replication kinetics in the primary target cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that CRF07_BC <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be superior over B ' and other HIV-1 subtypes in initiating infection in high-risk population</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings have molecular implications for the adaptive evolution of HIV-1 circulating in China and the design of tailored therapeutic strategy for treatment of HIV-1 CRF07_BC infection .</sentence>
