<sentence id="0">HIF-1alpha binding to VHL is regulated by stimulus-sensitive proline hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) is a global transcriptional regulator of the hypoxic response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Under normoxic conditions , HIF-1alpha is recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein ( VHL ) , a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This interaction thereby promotes the rapid degradation of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Under hypoxic conditions , HIF-1alpha is stabilized .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have previously shown that VHL binds in a hypoxia-sensitive manner to a 27-aa segment of HIF-1alpha , and that this regulation depends on a posttranslational modification of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Through a combination of in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays using VHL and a panel of point mutants of HIF-1alpha in this region , as well as MS and in vitro binding assays , we now provide evidence that this modification , which occurs under normoxic conditions , is hydroxylation of Pro-564 of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The data furthermore show that this proline hydroxylation is the primary regulator of VHL binding .</sentence>
