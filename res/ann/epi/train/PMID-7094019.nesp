<sentence id="0">Temperature-sensitive changes in the structure of globin chromatin in lines of red cell precursors transformed by ts-AEV .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chicken bone marrow cells infected in vitro with a temperature-sensitive avian erythroblastosis virus fall to produce hemoglobin at 36 degrees C. When the product or products of the transforming gene ( erb ) are inactivated by a temperature shift to 42 degrees C in culture , several different cloned lines of cells infected with the temperature-sensitive avian erythroblastosis virus begin to make hemoglobin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This shift in phenotype correlates with an increase in hemoglobin mRNA specific to both adult and embryonic alpha and beta globin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The switch is accompanied by the acquisition of DNAase I-hypersensitive sites in one cell line ( clone 2 ) ; however , a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothetically</cue> more mature</scope> line ( clone 3 ) has already acquired globin DNAase-hypersensitive sites but does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> express hemoglobin until the temperature shift</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Several ( but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> all</scope> ) specific restriction sites associated with both the alpha and beta domains become unmethylated after the switch from 36 degrees C to 42 degrees C. The magnitude of these methylation switches is small compared with changes that occur in these genes during normal avian erythropoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that changes in chromosomal structure precede transcription and are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> a consequence of transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Since ( presumptive ) precursor cloned lines <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">can</cue> be established with some , but not all , of the structural properties of active globin chromatin</scope> , it is <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">likely</cue> that many of these properties can be independently established and are <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> obligatorily related</scope></scope> .</sentence>
