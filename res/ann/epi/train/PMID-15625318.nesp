<sentence id="1">A new form of avian lysozyme , bare-faced curassow lysozyme ( BCL ) , was purified and chemically sequenced .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Of the 26 substitutions relative to chicken lysozyme , three , F34Y , T47S , and R114H , are of substrate-interacting residues in the E and F subsites , which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">would</cue> contribute to the acceptor binding for transglycosylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">T47S is a novel substitution in this lysozyme class .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">While other lysozymes also have substitutions at positions 114 and 34 , they also contain numerous others , including ones in the other substrate binding sites , A-D .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , T47S lies on the left side , while F34Y and R114H are located on the right side of the E-F subsites .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">BCL therefore <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> allow comparison of the independent contributions of these sites to substrate binding and transglycosylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The activity toward the N-acetylglucosamine pentamer revealed that the substitutions at the E-F sites reduced the binding free energies at the E-F sites and the rate constant for transglycosylation without the conformation change of other substrate binding sites on the protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">MD simulation analysis of BCL <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that the substituted amino acids changed the local conformation of this lysozyme at the E-F sites</scope> .</sentence>
