<sentence id="0">Recognition of polyubiquitin isoforms by the multiple ubiquitin binding modules of isopeptidase T .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The conjugation of polyubiquitin to target proteins acts as a signal that regulates target stability , localization , and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several ubiquitin binding domains have been described , and while much is known about ubiquitin binding to the isolated domains , little is known with regard to how the domains interact with polyubiquitin in the context of full-length proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Isopeptidase T ( IsoT/USP5 ) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is largely responsible for the disassembly of unanchored polyubiquitin in the cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">IsoT has four ubiquitin binding domains : a zinc finger domain ( ZnF UBP ) , which binds the proximal ubiquitin , a UBP domain that forms the active site , and two ubiquitin-associated ( UBA ) domains whose roles are <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we show that the UBA domains are involved in binding two different polyubiquitin isoforms , linear and K48-linked .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using isothermal titration calorimetry , we show that IsoT has at least four ubiquitin binding sites for both polyubiquitin isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The thermodynamics of the interactions reveal that the binding is enthalpy-driven .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Mutation of the UBA domains <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that UBA1 and UBA2 domains of IsoT interact with the third and fourth ubiquitins in both polyubiquitin isoforms , respectively</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that recognition of the polyubiquitin isoforms by IsoT involves considerable conformational mobility in the polyubiquitin ligand , in the enzyme , or in both</scope> .</sentence>
