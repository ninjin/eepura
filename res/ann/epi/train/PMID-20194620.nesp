<sentence id="0">Control of adipogenesis by the SUMO-specific protease SENP2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Here , we demonstrate that SENP2 , a desumoylating enzyme , plays a critical role in the control of adipogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">SENP2 expression was markedly increased upon the induction of adipocyte differentiation , and this increase was dependent on protein kinase A activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Remarkably , knockdown of SENP2 led to a dramatic attenuation of adipogenesis with a marked decrease in PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Knockdown of SENP2 also caused a marked reduction in the level of C/EBPbeta protein but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in that of C/EBPbeta mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , sumoylation of C/EBPbeta dramatically increased its ubiquitination and destabilization , and this increase could be reversed by SENP2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , overexpression of C/EBPbeta <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> overcome the inhibitory effect of SENP2 knockdown on adipogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , SENP2 was absolutely required for adipogenesis of preadipocytes implanted into mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results establish a critical role for SENP2 in the regulation of adipogenesis by desumoylation and stabilization of C/EBPbeta and in turn by promoting the expression of its downstream effectors , such as PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha .</sentence>
