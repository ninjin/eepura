<sentence id="0">Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 bZIP factor selectively suppresses the classical pathway of NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) is a highly aggressive T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The activation of NF-kappaB by Tax has been reported to play a crucial role in HTLV-1-induced transformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The HTLV-1 bZIP factor ( HBZ ) , which is encoded by an mRNA of the opposite polarity of the viral genomic RNA , is involved in both T cell proliferation and suppression of Tax-mediated viral gene transcription , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that HBZ cooperates closely with Tax</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , we observed that HBZ specifically suppressed NF-kappaB-driven transcription mediated by p65 ( the classical pathway ) without inhibiting the alternative NF-kappaB signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In an immunoprecipitation assay , HBZ bound to p65 and diminished the DNA binding capacity of p65 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , HBZ induced p65 degradation through increasing the expression of the PDLIM2 gene , which encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase for p65 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , HBZ actually repressed the transcription of some classical NF-kappaB target genes , such as IL-8 , IL2RA , IRF4 , VCAM-1 , and VEGF .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Selective suppression of the classical NF-kappaB pathway by HBZ renders the alternative NF-kappaB pathway predominant after activation of NF-kappaB by <scope type="spec" id="1"> Tax <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> other stimuli</scope> , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be critical for oncogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
