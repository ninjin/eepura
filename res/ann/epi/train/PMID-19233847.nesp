<sentence id="0">The ubiquitin ligase E6-AP is induced and recruited to aggresomes in response to proteasome inhibition and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be involved in the ubiquitination of Hsp70-bound misfolded proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cells are equipped with an efficient quality control system to selectively eliminate abnormally folded and damaged proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Initially the cell tries to refold the unfolded proteins with the help of molecular chaperones , and failure to refold leads to their degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">But how this proteolytic machinery recognizes the abnormally folded proteins is poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report that E6-AP , a HECT domain family ubiquitin ligase implicated in Angelman syndrome , interacts with the substrate binding domain of Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperones and promotes the degradation of chaperone bound substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The expression of E6-AP was dramatically induced under a variety of stresses , and overexpression of E6-AP was found to protect against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The inhibition of proteasome function not only increases the expression of E6-AP but also causes its redistribution around microtubule-organizing center , a subcellular structure for the degradation of the cytoplasmic misfolded proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">E6-AP is also recruited to aggresomes containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or expanded polyglutamine proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , we demonstrate that E6-AP ubiquitinates misfolded luciferase that is bound by Hsp70 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that E6-AP functions as a cellular quality control ubiquitin ligase and , therefore , can be implicated not only in the pathogenesis of Angelman syndrome but also in the biology of neurodegenerative disorders involving protein aggregation</scope> .</sentence>
