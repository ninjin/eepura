<sentence id="0">Probing the conformational and dynamical effects of O-glycosylation within the immunodominant region of a MUC1 peptide tumor antigen .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">MUC1 mucin is a large transmembrane glycoprotein , the extracellular domain of which is formed by a repeating 20 amino acid sequence , GVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAH .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In normal breast epithelial cells , the extracellular domain is densely covered with highly branched complex carbohydrate structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , in neoplastic breast tissue , the extracellular domain is under-glycosylated , resulting in the exposure of a highly immunogenic core peptide epitope ( PDTRP in bold above ) , as well as in the exposure of normally cryptic core Tn ( GalNAc ) , STn ( sialyl alpha2-6 GalNAc ) and TF ( Gal beta1-3 GalNAc ) carbohydrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report the results of 1H NMR structural studies , natural abundance 13C NMR relaxation measurements and distance-restrained MD simulations designed to probe the structural and dynamical effects of Tn-glycosylation within the PDTRP core peptide epitope .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Two synthetic peptides were studied : a nine-residue MUC1 peptide of the sequence , Thr1-Ser2-Ala3-Pro4-Asp5-Thr6-Arg7-Pro8-Ala9 , and a Tn-glycosylated version of this peptide , Thr1-Ser2-Ala3-Pro4-Asp5-Thr6(alphaGalNAc)-Arg7-Pro8-Ala9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results of these studies show that a type I beta-turn conformation is adopted by residues PDTR within the PDTRP region of the unglycosylated MUC1 sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The existence of a similar beta-turn within the PDTRP core peptide epitope of the under-glycosylated cancer-associated MUC1 mucin protein <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> explain the immunodominance of this region in vivo , as the presence of defined secondary structure within peptide epitope regions has been correlated with increased immunogenicity in other systems</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results have also shown that Tn glycosylation at the central threonine within the PDTRP core epitope region shifts the conformational equilibrium away from the type I beta-turn conformation and toward a more rigid and extended state .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The significance of these results are discussed in relation to the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> roles that peptide epitope secondary structure and glycosylation state <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> play in MUC1 tumor immunogenicity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
