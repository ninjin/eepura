<sentence id="0">Remodeling of the SCF complex-mediated ubiquitination system by compositional alteration of incorporated F-box proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ubiquitination regulates not only the stability but the localization and activity of substrate proteins involved in a plethora of cellular processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein ( SCF ) complexes constitute a major family of ubiquitin protein ligases , in each member of which an F-box protein serves as the variable component responsible for substrate recognition , thereby defining the function of each complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we studied <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the composition of F-box proteins in the SCF complexes is remodeled under different conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We exploited stable isotope labeling and MS for relative quantification of F-box proteins in the SCF complexes affinity-purified en masse from budding yeast cells at log and post-diauxic phases , and revealed an increment of Saf1 , an F-box protein involved in entry into quiescence , during the diauxic shift .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Similarly , we found that Met4 overexpression induces a specific increment of Met30 , the F-box protein responsible for ubiquitination of Met4 .</sentence>
