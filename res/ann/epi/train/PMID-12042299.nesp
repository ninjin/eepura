<sentence id="0">Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) asparagine hydroxylase is identical to factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) and is related to the cupin structural family .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activity of the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) complex is controlled by oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of prolyl and asparaginyl residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues by 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent oxygenases mediates ubiquitinylation and proteasomal destruction of HIF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Hydroxylation of an asparagine residue in the C-terminal transactivation domain ( CAD ) of HIF-alpha abrogates interaction with p300 , preventing transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Yeast two-hybrid assays recently identified factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) as a protein that associates with the CAD region of HIF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since FIH contains certain motifs present in iron- and 2-OG-dependent oxygenases we investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> FIH was the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Assays using recombinant FIH and HIF-alpha fragments revealed that FIH is the enzyme that hydroxylates the CAD asparagine residue , that the activity is directly inhibited by cobalt(II) and limited by hypoxia , and that the oxygen in the alcohol of the hydroxyasparagine residue is directly derived from dioxygen .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Sequence analyses involving FIH link the 2-OG oxygenases with members of the cupin superfamily , including Zn(II)-utilizing phosphomannose isomerase , revealing structural and evolutionary links between these metal-binding proteins that share common motifs .</sentence>
