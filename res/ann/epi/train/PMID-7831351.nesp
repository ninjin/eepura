<sentence id="0">The effects of O- and N-linked glycosylation on the secretion and bile salt-stimulation of pancreatic carboxyl ester lipase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Pancreatic carboxyl ester lipase is a glycoprotein that requires millimolar concentrations of trihydroxy bile salts , such as cholate , for maximal catalytic activity against cholesteryl esters and triglycerides .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Binding of cholate , with subsequent activation , has been proposed to occur in the carboxy-terminal region of carboxyl ester lipase , which contains multiple sites for O-linked glycosylation ( 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate the role of O- and N-linked glycosylation in the secretion of carboxyl ester lipase by cells and its activation by cholate , rat carboxyl ester lipase cDNA was transfected into the mutant chinese hamster ovary cell line , IdID , and the ability of the cells to modify the expressed carboxyl ester lipase by N- and O-linked glycosylation was modulated by using various incubation conditions and metabolic inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The results showed that , similar to other lipases , maximal secretion of carboxyl ester lipase activity required N-linked glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , O-linked glycosylation did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affect the secretion of carboxyl ester lipase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , the cholate stimulation of hydrolysis was also independent of O-linked glycosylation .</sentence>
