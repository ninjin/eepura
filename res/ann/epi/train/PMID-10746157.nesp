<sentence id="0">An increase in histone acetylation and IL-2 antagonizing the immunoinhibitory effect are necessary for augmentation by butyrate of in vitro anti-TNP antibody production .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We investigated the role of histone acetylation in the promotion of antigen-specific antibody production in murine B cells induced by sodium butyrate ( NaBu ) plus interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">NaBu dose dependently increased the acetylation levels of histone H4 at concentrations which effectively enhanced anti-trinitrophenyl ( TNP ) antibody production in the presence of IL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Among other short-chain fatty acids and NaBu analogs , propionate , valerate and vinylacetate were effective in the presence of IL-2 in increasing both antibody production and the histone H4 acetylation level , but acetate , alpha- , beta- and gamma-hydroxybutyrates and alpha- , beta- and gamma-aminobutyrates were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> effective , even in the presence of IL-2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The effect of the specific histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A ( TSA ) , which enhances anti-TNP antibody production <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> IL-2</scope> , was markedly inhibited by adding NaBu simultaneously .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , <scope type="neg" id="2">the effect of TSA was <cue type="neg" id="2">neither</cue> inhibited <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">nor</cue> potentiated by NaBu in the presence of IL-2</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Splenic B cells treated with NaBu , TSA and both together in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">absence</cue> of IL-2</scope> showed almost the same increased acetylation level of histone H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that the NaBu-induced enhancement of anti-TNP antibody production in the presence of IL-2 is mediated through a moderate increase in the level of histone acetylation and that NaBu has both stimulating and inhibiting activities for anti-TNP antibody production , the latter of which is overcome by IL-2</scope> .</sentence>
