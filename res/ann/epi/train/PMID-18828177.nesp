<sentence id="0">Production , purification , and characterization of human alpha1 proteinase inhibitor from Aspergillus niger .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human alpha one proteinase inhibitor ( alpha1-PI ) was cloned and expressed in Aspergillus niger , filamentious fungus that can grow in defined media and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> perform glycosylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Submerged culture conditions were established using starch as carbon source , 30 % dissolved oxygen concentration , pH 7.0 and 28 degrees C. Eight milligrams per liter of active alpha1-PI were secreted to the growth media in about 40 h. Controlling the protein proteolysis was found to be an important factor in the production .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The effects of various carbon sources , pH and temperature on the production and stability of the protein were tested and the product was purified and characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Two molecular weights variants of the recombinant alpha1-PI were produced by the fungus ; the difference is attributed to the glycosylated part of the molecule .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The two glycoproteins were treated with PNGAse F and the released glycans were analyzed by HPAEC , MALDI/TOF-MS , NSI-MS(n) , and GC-MS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The MALDI and NSI- full MS spectra of permethylated N-glycans revealed that the N-glycans of both variants contain a series of high-mannose type glycans with 5-20 hexose units .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Monosaccharide analysis showed that these were composed of N-acetylglucos-amine , mannose , and galactose .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Linkage analysis revealed that the galactosyl component was in the furanoic conformation , which was attaching in a terminal non-reducing position .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The Galactofuranose-containing high-mannnose type N-glycans are typical structures , which recently have been found as part of several glycoproteins produced by Aspergillus niger .</sentence>
