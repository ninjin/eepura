<sentence id="0">Minoxidil exerts different inhibitory effects on gene expression of lysyl hydroxylase 1 , 2 , and 3 : implications for collagen cross-linking and treatment of fibrosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Collagen deposits in fibrotic lesions often display elevated levels of hydroxyallysine ( pyridinoline ) cross-links .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The relation between the occurrence of pyridinoline cross-links and the irreversibility of fibrosis <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that these cross-links contribute to the aberrant accumulation of collagen</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Based on its inhibitory effect on lysyl hydroxylase activity minoxidil has been postulated to possess anti-fibrotic properties by limiting the hydroxylysine supply for hydroxyallysine cross-linking .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , to interfere with hydroxyallysine cross-linking specifically lysyl hydroxylation of the collagen telopeptide <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> be inhibited , a reaction predominantly catalysed by lysyl hydroxylase ( LH ) 2b</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we demonstrate that minoxidil treatment of cultured fibroblasts reduces LH1>>LH2b>LH3 mRNA levels dose-and time-dependently , but has essentially <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect on the total number of pyridinoline cross-links in the collagen matrix</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Still the collagen produced in the presence of minoxidil displays some remarkable features : hydroxylation of triple helical lysine residues is reduced to 50 % and lysylpyridinoline cross-linking is increased at the expense of hydroxylysylpyridinoline cross-linking .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These observations can be explained by our finding that LH1 mRNA levels are the most sensitive to minoxidil treatment , corroborating that LH1 has a preference for triple helical lysine residues as substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , the non-proportional increase in cross-links ( 20-fold ) with respect to the decrease in lysyl hydroxylation state of the triple helix ( 2-fold ) even <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> that LH1 preferentially hydroxylates triple helical lysine residues at the cross-link positions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We conclude that <scope type="spec" id="4"> minoxidil is <cue type="spec" id="4">unlikely</cue> to serve as an anti-fibroticum , but confers features to the collagen matrix , which provide insight into the substrate specificity of LH1</scope> .</sentence>
