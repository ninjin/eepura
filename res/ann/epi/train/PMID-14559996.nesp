<sentence id="0">mSin3A/histone deacetylase 2- and PRMT5-containing Brg1 complex is involved in transcriptional repression of the Myc target gene cad .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The role of hSWI/SNF complexes in transcriptional activation is well characterized ; however , little is known about their function in transcriptional repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have previously shown that subunits of the mSin3A/histone deacetylase 2 ( HDAC2 ) corepressor complex copurify with hSWI/SNF complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that the type II arginine-specific methyltransferase PRMT5 , which is involved in cyclin E repression , can be found in association with Brg1 and hBrm-based hSWI/SNF complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also show that hSWI/SNF-associated PRMT5 can methylate hypoacetylated histones H3 and H4 more efficiently than hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Protein-protein interaction studies <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> PRMT5 and mSin3A interact with the same hSWI/SNF subunits as those targeted by c-Myc</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These observations prompted us to examine the expression profile of the c-Myc target genes , carbamoyl-phosphate synthase-aspartate carbamoyltransferase-dihydroorotase ( cad ) and nucleolin ( nuc ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We found that cad repression is altered in cells that express inactive Brg1 and in cells treated with the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays , we found that Brg1 , mSin3A , HDAC2 , and PRMT5 are directly recruited to the cad promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that hSWI/SNF complexes , through their ability to interact with activator and repressor proteins , control expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
