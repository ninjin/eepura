<sentence id="0">Histone hyperacetylation in mitosis prevents sister chromatid separation and produces chromosome segregation defects .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Posttranslational modifications of core histones contribute to driving changes in chromatin conformation and compaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Herein , we investigated the role of histone deacetylation on the mitotic process by inhibiting histone deacetylases shortly before mitosis in human primary fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cells entering mitosis with hyperacetylated histones displayed altered chromatin conformation associated with decreased reactivity to the anti-Ser 10 phospho H3 antibody , increased recruitment of protein phosphatase 1-delta on mitotic chromosomes , and depletion of heterochromatin protein 1 from the centromeric heterochromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Inhibition of histone deacetylation before mitosis produced defective chromosome condensation and impaired mitotic progression in living cells , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that improper chromosome condensation <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> induce mitotic checkpoint activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In situ hybridization analysis on anaphase cells demonstrated the presence of chromatin bridges , which were caused by persisting cohesion along sister chromatid arms after centromere separation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , the presence of hyperacetylated chromatin during mitosis impairs proper chromosome condensation during the pre-anaphase stages , resulting in poor sister chromatid resolution .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Lagging chromosomes consisting of single or paired sisters were also induced by the presence of hyperacetylated histones , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> the less constrained centromeric organization associated with heterochromatin protein 1 depletion <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> promote the attachment of kinetochores to microtubules coming from both poles</scope></scope> .</sentence>
