<sentence id="0">Histone deacetylase inhibitors promote the tumoricidal effect of HAMLET .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDIs ) and HAMLET ( human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells ) interact with histones , modify the structure of chromatin , and trigger tumor cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This study investigated how the combination of HDIs and HAMLET influences cell viability , histone acetylation , and DNA integrity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The pretreatment of tumor cells with HDIs was shown to enhance the lethal effect of HAMLET and the histone hyperacetylation response to HDIs increased even further after HAMLET treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HDIs and HAMLET were shown to target different histone domains as HAMLET bound tailless core histones , whereas HDIs modify the acetylation of the histone tail .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">DNA damage in response to HAMLET was increased by HDIs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The DNA repair response ( p21WAFI expression ) was induced by both agonists but abolished when the two agonists were combined .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the synergy of HDIs and HAMLET is based on different but converging death pathways , both involving chromatin alterations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">speculate</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="2"> HAMLET and HDIs <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be combined to promote tumor cell death in vivo</scope></scope> .</sentence>
