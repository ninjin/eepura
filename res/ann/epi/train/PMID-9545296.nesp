<sentence id="0">Protein disulfide isomerase acts as a molecular chaperone during the assembly of procollagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein-disulfide isomerase ( PDI ) has been shown to be a multifunctional enzyme catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds , as well as being a component of the enzymes prolyl 4-hydroxylase ( P4-H ) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has also been proposed to function as a molecular chaperone during the refolding of denatured proteins in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate the role of this multifunctional protein within a cellular context , we have established a semi-permeabilized cell system that reconstitutes the synthesis , folding , modification , and assembly of procollagen as they <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">would</cue> occur in the cell</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We demonstrate here that P4-H associates transiently with the triple helical domain during the assembly of procollagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The release of P4-H from the triple helical domain coincides with assembly into a thermally stable triple helix .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , if triple helix formation is prevented , P4-H remains associated , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a role for this enzyme in preventing aggregation of this domain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also show that PDI associates independently with the C-propeptide of monomeric procollagen chains prior to trimer formation , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating</cue> a role for this protein in coordinating the assembly of heterotrimeric molecules</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This demonstrates that PDI has multiple functions in the folding of the same protein , that is , as a catalyst for disulfide bond formation , as a subunit of P4-H during proline hydroxylation , and independently as a molecular chaperone during chain assembly .</sentence>
