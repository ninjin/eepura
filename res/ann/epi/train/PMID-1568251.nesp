<sentence id="0">Histone H4 isoforms acetylated at specific lysine residues define individual chromosomes and chromatin domains in Drosophila polytene nuclei .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone H4 isoforms acetylated at lysines 5 , 8 , 12 , or 16 have been shown , by indirect immunofluorescence with site-specific antisera , to have distinct patterns of distribution in interphase , polytene chromosomes from Drosophila larvae .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">H4 molecules acetylated at lysines 5 or 8 are distributed in overlapping , but nonidentical , islands throughout the euchromatic chromosome arms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">beta-Heterochromatin in the chromocenter is depleted in these isoforms , but relatively enriched in H4 acetylated at lysine 12 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">H4 acetylated at lysine 16 is found at numerous sites along the transcriptionally hyperactive X chromosome in male larvae , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in male autosomes or any chromosome in female cells</scope> .</sentence>
