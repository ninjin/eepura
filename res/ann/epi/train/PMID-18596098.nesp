<sentence id="0">Viral genome methylation as an epigenetic defense against geminiviruses .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Geminiviruses encapsidate single-stranded DNA genomes that replicate in plant cell nuclei through double-stranded DNA intermediates that associate with cellular histone proteins to form minichromosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Like most plant viruses , geminiviruses are targeted by RNA silencing and encode suppressor proteins such as AL2 and L2 to counter this defense .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These related proteins can suppress silencing by multiple mechanisms , one of which involves interacting with and inhibiting adenosine kinase ( ADK ) , a cellular enzyme associated with the methyl cycle that generates S-adenosyl-methionine , an essential methyltransferase cofactor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesized</cue> that the viral genome is targeted by small-RNA-directed methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we show that Arabidopsis plants with mutations in genes encoding cytosine or histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9 ) methyltransferases , RNA-directed methylation pathway components , or ADK are hypersensitive to geminivirus infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also demonstrate that viral DNA and associated histone H3 are methylated in infected plants and that cytosine methylation levels are significantly reduced in viral DNA isolated from methylation-deficient mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , we demonstrate that Beet curly top virus L2- mutant DNA present in tissues that have recovered from infection is hypermethylated and that host recovery requires AGO4 , a component of the RNA-directed methylation pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that plants use chromatin methylation as a defense against DNA viruses , which geminiviruses counter by inhibiting global methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , our results establish that geminiviruses can be useful models for genome methylation in plants and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that there are redundant pathways leading to cytosine methylation</scope> .</sentence>
