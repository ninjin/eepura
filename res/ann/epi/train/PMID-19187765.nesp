<sentence id="0">ING4 mediates crosstalk between histone H3 K4 trimethylation and H3 acetylation to attenuate cellular transformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Aberrations in chromatin dynamics play a fundamental role in tumorigenesis , yet relatively little is known of the molecular mechanisms linking histone lysine methylation to neoplastic disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">ING4 ( Inhibitor of Growth 4 ) is a native subunit of an HBO1 histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) complex and a tumor suppressor protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show a critical role for specific recognition of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 ( H3K4me3 ) by the ING4 PHD finger in mediating ING4 gene expression and tumor suppressor functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The interaction between ING4 and H3K4me3 augments HBO1 acetylation activity on H3 tails and drives H3 acetylation at ING4 target promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , ING4 facilitates apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress and inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth , and these functions depend on ING4 interactions with H3K4me3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Together , our results demonstrate a mechanism for brokering crosstalk between H3K4 methylation and H3 acetylation and reveal a molecular link between chromatin modulation and tumor suppressor mechanisms .</sentence>
