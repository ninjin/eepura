<sentence id="0">AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylates R5/PTG , the glycogen targeting subunit of the R5/PTG-protein phosphatase 1 holoenzyme , and accelerates its down-regulation by the laforin-malin complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">R5/PTG is one of the glycogen targeting subunits of type 1 protein phosphatase , a master regulator of glycogen synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">R5/PTG recruits the phosphatase to the places where glycogen synthesis occurs , allowing the activation of glycogen synthase and the inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase , thus increasing glycogen synthesis and decreasing its degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this report , we show that the activity of R5/PTG is regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We demonstrate that AMPK interacts physically with R5/PTG and modifies its basal phosphorylation status .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have also mapped the major phosphorylation sites of R5/PTG by mass spectrometry analysis , observing that phosphorylation of Ser-8 and Ser-268 increased upon activation of AMPK .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have recently described that the activity of R5/PTG is down-regulated by the laforin-malin complex , composed of a dual specificity phosphatase ( laforin ) and an E3-ubiquitin ligase ( malin ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We now demonstrate that phosphorylation of R5/PTG at Ser-8 by AMPK accelerates its laforin/malin-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation , which results in a decrease of its glycogenic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , our results define a novel role of AMPK in glycogen homeostasis .</sentence>
