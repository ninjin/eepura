<sentence id="0">Dnmt3b recruitment through E2F6 transcriptional repressor mediates germ-line gene silencing in murine somatic tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of cytosine residues within the CpG dinucleotide in mammalian cells is an important mediator of gene expression , genome stability , X-chromosome inactivation , genomic imprinting , chromatin structure , and embryonic development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The majority of CpG sites in mammalian cells is methylated in a nonrandom fashion , raising the question of how DNA methylation is distributed along the genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we focused on the functions of DNA methyltransferase-3b ( Dnmt3b ) , of which deregulated activity is linked to several human pathologies .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We generated Dnmt3b hypomorphic mutant mice with reduced catalytic activity , which first revealed a deregulation of Hox genes expression , consistent with the observed homeotic transformations of the posterior axis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , analysis of deregulated expression programs in Dnmt3b mutant embryos , using DNA microarrays , highlighted illegitimate activation of several germ-line genes in somatic tissues <scope type="spec" id="0"> that <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to be linked directly to their hypomethylation in mutant embryos</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We provide evidence that these genes are direct targets of Dnmt3b .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , the recruitment of Dnmt3b to their proximal promoter is dependant on the binding of the E2F6 transcriptional repressor , which emerges as a common hallmark in the promoters of genes found to be up-regulated as a consequence of impaired Dnmt3b activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , our results unraveled a coordinated regulation of genes involved in meiosis , through E2F6-dependant methylation and transcriptional silencing in somatic tissues .</sentence>
