<sentence id="0">Expression of Pichia anomala INV1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in two different active forms of hypoglycosylated invertase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Pichia anomala invertase gene ( INV1 ) was introduced at different copy numbers into a sucrose-nonfermenting mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and expressed from its own promoter sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The level reached in the production of invertase by the transformants ( up to 540 units/10(10) cells ) was in agreement with the INV1 gene dosage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Two forms of multimeric active and glycosylated invertase displaying different subcellular locations and molecular masses could be detected in the transformants .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One was found to be present in the culture medium and in the periplasm , and the other <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> only be detected inside the cell</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Each of the two heterologous forms of invertase was shown to be an oligomer composed of identical subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The difference found in the apparent molecular masses of their monomers ( 81.5 and 78.3 kDa , respectively ) <cue type="spec" id="1">seems</cue> to be due to the size of their N-linked oligosaccharide chains ( on average 2.4 and 1.9 kDa , respectively ) , since the number of sugar chains ( 9 ) and the molecular mass of the protein moiety ( 60.5 kDa ) are identical in both forms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The shorter size of their oligosaccharides must also be the reason for the lower apparent molecular masses of the heterologous invertases when compared with the enzyme purified from P. anomala .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The hypoglycosylated invertase accumulated within the cells of the transformants to an unusual level ( up to 130 units/10(10) cells ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Such accumulation of active enzyme inside the cells , as well as its underglycosylation , could be due to intrinsic properties of the P. anomala invertase that are determined by the particular primary structure of its protein moiety .</sentence>
