<sentence id="0">Targeted restoration of down-regulated DAPK2 tumor suppressor activity induces apoptosis in Hodgkin lymphoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Death-associated protein kinase 2 ( DAPK2 ) is a calcium/calmodulin-regulated proapoptotic serine/threonine kinase that acts as a tumor suppressor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that DAPK2 is down-regulated in Hodgkin lymphoma-derived tumor cell lines and that promoter-region hypermethylation is one mechanism for DAPK2 inactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> selective reconstitution of DAPK2 catalytic activity in these cells <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> induce apoptosis</scope></scope> , we created a fusion protein comprising a human CD30 ligand conjugated to a human DAPK2 calmodulin-deletion mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus , recombinant immunokinase DAPK2'-CD30L has a constitutive kinase activity with enhanced proapoptotic function .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that this immunokinase fusion protein inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death specifically in CD30/DAPK2-negative tumor cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This proof-of-concept study provides the first demonstration of therapeutic strategies based on the restoration of a defective , tumor-suppressing kinase activity by a novel class of recombinant immunotherapeutics .</sentence>
