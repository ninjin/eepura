<sentence id="0">Decrease in tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor-associated death domain results from ubiquitin-dependent degradation in obstructive renal injury in rats .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Increased expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) is involved in tubulointerstitial cell proliferation and apoptosis in obstructive renal injury .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Two TNFalpha receptors ( TNFRs ) , TNFR1 and TNFR2 , are known to exist .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">On TNFalpha binding , TNFR1 recruits TNFR-associated death domain ( TRADD ) , an assembly platform to mediate TNFR1 signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We investigated postreceptor TRADD regulation in rat kidneys with unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Whereas UUO was associated with increased expression levels of TNFalpha , TNFR1 , TNFR2 , and TRADD mRNAs , it resulted in the marked decrease of TRADD protein levels ( which appeared at day 1 and persisted thereafter ) and a slight decrease in TNFR1 protein levels at days 7 and 14 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Both ubiquitination and degradation of TRADD were increased in UUO kidneys , degradation of TRADD was stimulated by TNFalpha in HK-2 cells , and TRADD degradation was suppressed by proteasome inhibitor .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Inhibition of TNFalpha by soluble TNFR2 , etanercept , reduced significantly , although transiently , tubular and interstitial cell proliferation , fibronectin expression , and apoptosis in UUO kidneys , and also suppressed TRADD degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the decrease in TRADD resulting from enhanced ubiquitin-dependent degradation is involved in obstructive renal injury</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Since <scope type="neg" id="1">TRADD is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> incorporated into TNFR2-mediated TNFalpha signaling</scope> , the persistent decrease in TRADD , associated with a mild decrease in TNFR1 levels , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> function , at least in part ,</scope> to divert TNFalpha signals toward a TNFR2-mediated pathway in UUO kidneys .</sentence>
