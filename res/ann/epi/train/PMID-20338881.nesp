<sentence id="0">Gene silencing induced by oxidative DNA base damage : association with local decrease of histone H4 acetylation in the promoter region .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxidized DNA bases , particularly 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine ( 8-oxoG ) , are endogenously generated in cells , being a cause of carcinogenic mutations and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibly</cue> interfering with gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We found that expression of an oxidatively damaged plasmid DNA is impaired after delivery into human host cells not only due to decreased retention in the transfected cells , but also due to selective silencing of the damaged reporter gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To test <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the gene silencing was associated with a specific change of the chromatin structure</scope> , we determined the levels of histone modifications related to transcriptional activation ( acetylated histones H3 and H4 ) or repression ( methylated K9 and K27 of the histone H3 , and histone H1 ) in the promoter region and in the downstream transcribed DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Acetylation of histone H4 was found to be specifically decreased by 25 % in the proximal promoter region of the damaged gene , while minor quantitative changes in other tested chromatin components could not be proven as significant .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment with an inhibitor of histone deacetylases , trichostatin A , partially restored expression of the damaged DNA , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a causal connection between the changes of histone acetylation and persistent gene repression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Based on these findings , we <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that silencing of the oxidatively damaged DNA <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> occur in a chromatin-mediated mechanism</scope></scope> .</sentence>
