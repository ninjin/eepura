<sentence id="0">Inhibition of fusion by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The majority of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) to the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase ( HN ) glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus prevent attachment of the virus to cellular receptors and inhibits virion-induced fusion from <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> ( FFWO</scope> ) and fusion from within ( FFWI ) mediated by the virus glycoprotein-laden infected cell surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">For these antibodies , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the inhibition of fusion is <cue type="spec" id="1">presumed</cue> to be the result of the prevention of HN-mediated bridging of potential fusion partners</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">MAbs against antigenic sites 3 and 4 neutralize virus infectivity , but by a mechanism other than the prevention of attachment , the exact nature of which remains to be established .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Antibodies to both of these sites effectively inhibit virion-induced FFWO , even when the inducing virus is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> infectious</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This is consistent with the mechanism of neutralization of these MAbs involving the inhibition of an early , post-attachment step in infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">MAbs to site 3 also inhibit FFWI , but those to site 4 do <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> , even when added at high concentrations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> that the requirement for HN <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be different in the two modes of fusion</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The epitopes recognized by MAbs to sites 3 and 4 have been delineated by the identification of individual nucleotide substitutions in the HN genes of neutralization escape variants .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Some of the deduced amino acid substitutions result in additional N-linked glycosylation sites in HN , <scope type="spec" id="6"> which are utilized and <cue type="spec" id="6">presumably</cue> account for the escape from neutralization</scope> .</sentence>
