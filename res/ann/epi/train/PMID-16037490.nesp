<sentence id="0">Differential analysis of site-specific glycans on plasma and cellular fibronectins : application of a hydrophilic affinity method for glycopeptide enrichment .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Isolation of glycopeptides utilizing hydrogen bonding between glycopeptide glycans and a carbohydrate-gel matrix in the organic phase is useful for site-specific characterization of oligosaccharides of glycoproteins , when combined with mass spectrometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , recovery of glycopeptides was improved by including divalent cations or increasing the organic solvent in the binding solution , without losing specificity , whereas it was still less effective for those with a long peptide backbone exceeding 50 amino acid residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The method was then applied to the analysis of glycan heterogeneities at seven N-glycosylation sites in each of the plasma and cellular fibronectins ( FNs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">There was a remarkable site-specific difference in fucosylation between these isoforms ; Asn1244 selectively escaped the global fucosylation of cellular FN , whereas only Asn1007 and Asn2108 of the plasma isoform underwent modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , a new O-glycosylation site was identified at Thr279 in the connecting segment between the fibrin- and heparin-binding domain and the collagen-binding domain , and the glycopeptide was reactive to a peanut agglutinin lectin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Considering that another mucin-type O-glycosylation site lies within a different connecting segment , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the O-glycosylation of FN was <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> to play a significant role in segregating the neighboring domains and thus maintaining the topology of FN and the domain functions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , the method was applied to apolipoprotein B-100 ( apoB100 ) whose N-glycan structures at 17 of 19 potential sites have been reported , and characterized the remaining sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The results also demonstrated that the enriched glycopeptide provides resources for site-specific analysis of oligosaccharides in glycoproteomics .</sentence>
