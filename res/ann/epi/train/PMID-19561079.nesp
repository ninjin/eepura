<sentence id="0">The thioxotriazole copper(II) complex A0 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and paraptotic death in human cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The copper(II) complex A0 induces a type of non-apoptotic cell death also known as paraptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Paraptosis involves extensive endoplasmic reticulum vacuolization in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of caspase activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A wide panel of human cancer cell lines was used to demonstrate differences in cytotoxicity by the paraptosis-inducing drug A0 and the metal-based pro-apoptotic drug cisplatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Gene expression profiling of the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells showed that , while cisplatin induced p53 targets , A0 up-regulated genes involved in the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and response to heavy metals .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The cytotoxic effects of A0 were associated with inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and accumulation of ubiquitinylated proteins , in a manner dependent on protein synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cycloheximide inhibited the accumulation of ubiquitinylated proteins and hampered A0-induced cell death process .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The occurrence of the UPR during A0-induced death process was shown by the increased abundance of spliced XBP1 mRNA , transient eIF2alpha phosphorylation , and a series of downstream events , including attenuation of global protein synthesis and increased expression of ATF4 , CHOP , BIP , and GADD34 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing a mutant eIF2alpha , <scope type="spec" id="2"> which <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1"><cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> not</cue> be phosphorylated</scope></scope> , were more resistant to A0 than wild type cells , pointing to a pro-death role of eIF2alpha phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">A0 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> thus represent the prototypical member of a new class of compounds that cause paraptotic cell death via mechanisms involving eIF2alpha phosphorylation and the UPR</scope> .</sentence>
