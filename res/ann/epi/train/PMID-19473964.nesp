<sentence id="0">Structure and biochemical characterization of protein acetyltransferase from Sulfolobus solfataricus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Sulfolobus solfataricus protein acetyltransferase ( PAT ) acetylates ALBA , an abundant nonspecific DNA-binding protein , on Lys(16) to reduce its DNA affinity , and the Sir2 deacetylase reverses the modification to cause transcriptional repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This represents a " primitive " model for chromatin regulation analogous to histone modification in eukaryotes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We report the 1.84-A crystal structure of PAT in complex with coenzyme A. The structure reveals homology to both prokaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases and eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) , with an additional " bent helix " proximal to the substrate binding site that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> play an autoregulatory function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Investigation of active site mutants <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that PAT does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> use a single general base or acid residue for substrate deprotonation and product reprotonation , respectively</scope> , and that a diffusional step , such as substrate binding , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be rate-limiting</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The catalytic efficiency of PAT toward ALBA is low relative to other acetyltransferases , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that there <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be better</scope></scope> , unidentified substrates for PAT .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The structural similarity of PAT to eukaryotic HATs combined with its conserved role in chromatin regulation <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggests</cue> that PAT is evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic HATs</scope> .</sentence>
