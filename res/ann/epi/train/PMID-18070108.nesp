<sentence id="0">Type I receptor binding of bone morphogenetic protein 6 is dependent on N-glycosylation of the ligand .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) , together with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and activins/inhibins , constitute the TGF-beta superfamily of ligands .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This superfamily is formed by more than 30 structurally related secreted proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The crystal structure of human BMP-6 was determined to a resolution of 2.1 A ; the overall structure is similar to that of other TGF-beta superfamily ligands , e.g. BMP-7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The asymmetric unit contains the full dimeric BMP-6 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> asymmetry between the two monomeric subunits</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Indeed , the conformation of several loops differs between both monomers .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In particular , the prehelix loop , which plays a crucial role in the type I receptor interactions of BMP-2 , adopts two rather different conformations in BMP-6 , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating</cue> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possible</cue> dynamic</scope> flexibility of the prehelix loop in its unbound conformation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Flexibility of this loop segment has been discussed as an important feature required for promiscuous binding of different type I receptors to BMPs .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Further studies investigating the interaction of BMP-6 with different ectodomains of type I receptors revealed that N-glycosylation at Asn73 of BMP-6 in the wrist epitope is crucial for recognition by the activin receptor type I. In the <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">absence</cue> of the carbohydrate moiety</scope> , activin receptor type I-mediated signaling of BMP-6 is totally diminished .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , flexibility within the binding epitope of BMP-6 and an unusual recognition motif , i.e. an N-glycosylation motif , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possibly</cue> play an important role in type I receptor specificity of BMP-6</scope> .</sentence>
