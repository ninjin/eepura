<sentence id="0">Monoubiquitinylation regulates endosomal localization of Lst2 , a negative regulator of EGF receptor signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Genetic screens performed in worms identified major regulators of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) pathway , including the ubiquitin ligase Cbl/SLI-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we focus on the less-characterized Lst2 protein and confirm suppression of MAPK signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Unexpectedly , human Lst2 , a monoubiquitinylated phosphoprotein , does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> localize to endosomes</scope> , despite an intrinsic phosphoinositol-binding FYVE domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By constructing an ubiquitinylation-defective mutant and an ubiquitin fusion , we conclude that endosomal localization of Lst2 , along with an ability to divert incoming EGFR molecules to degradation in lysosomes , is regulated by ubiquitinylation/deubiquitinylation cycles .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistent with bifurcating roles , Lst2 physically binds Trim3/BERP , which interacts with Hrs and a complex that biases cargo recycling .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results establish an ubiquitin-based endosomal switch of receptor sorting , functionally equivalent to the mechanism inactivating Hrs via monoubiquitinylation .</sentence>
