<sentence id="0">Ubiquitination-mediated internalization and degradation of the astroglial glutamate transporter , GLT-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Sodium-dependent glutamate uptake is essential for limiting excitotoxicity , and dysregulation of this process has been implicated in a wide array of neurological disorders .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The majority of forebrain glutamate uptake is mediated by the astroglial glutamate transporter , GLT-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We and others have shown that this transporter undergoes endocytosis and degradation in response to activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , however , the mechanisms involved remain unclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the current study , transfected C6 glioma cells or primary cortical cultures were used to show that PKC activation results in incorporation of ubiquitin into GLT-1 immunoprecipitates .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutation of all 11 lysine residues in the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains to arginine ( 11R ) abolished this signal .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Selective mutation of the seven lysine residues in the carboxyl terminus ( C7K-R ) did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> eliminate ubiquitination</scope> , but it completely blocked PKC-dependent internalization and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Two families of variants of GLT-1 were prepared with various lysine residues mutated to arginine .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Analyses of these constructs <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> redundant lysine residues in the carboxyl terminus were sufficient for the appearance of ubiquitinated product and degradation of GLT-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Together these data define a novel mechanism by which the predominant forebrain glutamate transporter can be rapidly targeted for degradation .</sentence>
