<sentence id="0">Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) is a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS domain transcription factor that is expressed in all metazoan organisms and is composed of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Under hypoxic conditions , HIF-1 regulates the transcription of hundreds of genes in a cell type-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The HIF-1alpha subunit is regulated by O2-dependent hydroxylation of proline <scope type="spec" id="0"> residue 402 , 564 , <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> both</scope> , by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 ( PHD2 ) , which promotes binding of the von Hippel-Lindau protein ( VHL ) , leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation ; and O2-dependent hydroxylation of asparagine residue 803 by factor inhibiting HIF-1 ( FIH-1 ) , which blocks the binding of the 300-kilodalton coactivator protein ( p300 ) and CREB binding protein ( CBP ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The hydroxylation reactions , which utilize O2 and alpha-ketoglutarate as substrates and generate CO2 and succinate as by-products , provide a mechanism by which changes in cellular oxygenation are transduced to the nucleus as changes in HIF-1 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hydroxylase activity is inhibited in the presence of low concentrations of O2 , high concentrations of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates ( isocitrate , oxaloacetate , succinate , or fumarate ) , or chelators of Fe(II) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Receptor for activated C kinase 1 ( RACK1 ) competes with heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ) for binding to HIF-1alpha and mediates O2-independent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A growing number of proteins and small molecules have been identified that regulate HIF-1 activity by modulating the physical or functional interaction of PHD2 , VHL , FIH-1 , RACK1 , or HSP90 with HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
