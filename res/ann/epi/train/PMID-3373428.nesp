<sentence id="0">Binding of gossypol derivatives to human serum albumin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In light of our previous finding that gossypol competes effectively with bilirubin for the high affinity bilirubin binding site on human serum albumin , a study of the binding to albumin of four gossypol derivatives was undertaken .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The derivatives are compounds in which the aldehyde groups of gossypol are converted to nitriles and the periphenolic groups are acylated with acetyl , propionyl , butyryl , or valeryl groups .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These periacylated gossylic nitriles bind to the high affinity bilirubin binding site on human serum albumin , but with dissociation constants approximately 30 times greater than that of gossypol .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The gossypol derivatives also bind to another site on albumin , but with dissociation constants approximately 6 times greater than those for the bilirubin site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This second site has been identified as the major drug binding site in domain III .</sentence>
