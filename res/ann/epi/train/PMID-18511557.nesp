<sentence id="0">Asymmetric mitosis : Unequal segregation of proteins destined for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mitotic cell division ensures that two daughter somatic cells inherit identical genetic material .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous work has shown that signaling by the Smad1 transcription factor is terminated by polyubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation after essential phosphorylations by MAPK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that , unexpectedly , proteins specifically targeted for proteasomal degradation are inherited preferentially by one mitotic daughter during somatic cell division .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Experiments with dividing human embryonic stem cells and other mammalian cultured cell lines demonstrated that in many supposedly equal mitoses the segregation of proteins destined for degradation ( Smad1 phosphorylated by MAPK and GSK3 , phospho-beta-catenin , and total polyubiquitinylated proteins ) was asymmetric .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transport of pSmad1 targeted for degradation to the centrosome required functional microtubules .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In vivo , an antibody specific for Mad phosphorylated by MAPK showed that this antigen was associated preferentially with one of the two centrosomes in Drosophila embryos at cellular blastoderm stage .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="1"> this remarkable cellular property <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be explained by the asymmetric inheritance of peripheral centrosomal proteins when centrioles separate and migrate to opposite poles of the cell</scope></scope> , so that one mitotic daughter remains pristine .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that many mitotic divisions are unequal , unlike what was previously <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">thought</cue></scope> .</sentence>
