<sentence id="0">Human herpesvirus-8 glycoprotein B interacts with Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) glycoprotein 110 but fails to complement the infectivity of EBV mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To characterize human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV-8 ) gB , the open reading frame was PCR amplified from the HHV-8-infected cell line BCBL-1 and cloned into an expression vector .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To facilitate detection of expressed HHV-8 gB , the cytoplasmic tail of the glycoprotein was tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Expression of tagged HHV-8 gB ( gB-HA ) , as well as the untagged form , was readily detected in CHO-K1 cells and several lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HHV-8 gB-HA was sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment , and immunofluorescence revealed that HHV-8 gB-HA was detectable in the perinuclear region of CHO-K1 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These observations <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="0">HHV-8 gB is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> processed in the Golgi</scope> and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear membrane</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Because both HHV-8 and EBV are gamma-herpesviruses , the ability of HHV-8 gB to interact with and functionally complement EBV gp110 was examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">HHV-8 gB-HA and EBV gp110 co-immunoprecipitated , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating</cue> formation of hetero-oligomers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , HHV-8 gB-HA and HHV-8 gB <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">failed</cue> to restore the infectivity of gp110-negative EBV mutants</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> although HHV-8 gB and EBV gp110 have similar patterns of intracellular localization and can interact , there is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> sufficient functional homology to allow efficient complementation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
