<sentence id="0">Defective ubiquitinylation of EGFR mutants of lung cancer confers prolonged signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several distinct mutations within the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) are associated with non-small cell lung cancer , but mechanisms underlying their oncogenic potential are incompletely understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although normally ligand-induced kinase activation targets EGFR to Cbl-mediated receptor ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation in lysosomes , we report that certain EGFR mutants escape this regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Defective endocytosis characterizes a deletion mutant of EGFR , as well as a point mutant ( L858R-EGFR ) , whose association with c-Cbl and ubiquitinylation are impaired .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our data raise the possibility that refractoriness of L858R-EGFR to downregulation is due to enhanced heterodimerization with the oncogene product HER2 , which leads to persistent stimulation .</sentence>
