<sentence id="0">Tumor suppressor cylindromatosis acts as a negative regulator for Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced NFAT signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that colonizes the upper respiratory tract and is also the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">S. pneumoniae causes invasive diseases such as pneumonia , meningitis , and otitis media .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Despite the importance of pneumococcal diseases , little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which S. pneumoniae-induced inflammation is regulated , especially the negative regulatory mechanisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that S. pneumoniae activates nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) signaling pathway and the subsequent up-regulation of inflammatory mediators via a key pneumococcal virulence factor , pneumolysin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also demonstrate that S. pneumoniae activates NFAT transcription factor independently of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , S. pneumoniae induces NFAT activation via both Ca(2+)-calcineurin and transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MKK ) 3/6-p38alpha/beta-dependent signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , we found for the first time that tumor suppressor cylindromatosis ( CYLD ) acts as a negative regulator for S. pneumoniae-induced NFAT signaling pathway via a deubiquitination-dependent mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , we showed that CYLD interacts with and deubiquitinates TAK1 to negatively regulate the activation of the downstream MKK3/6-p38alpha/beta pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our studies thus bring new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae infections through the NFAT-dependent mechanism and further identify CYLD as a negative regulator for NFAT signaling , thereby opening up new therapeutic targets for these diseases .</sentence>
