<sentence id="0">A haploid affair : core histone transitions during spermatogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The process of meiosis reduces a diploid cell to four haploid gametes and is accompanied by extensive recombination .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Thus , the dynamics of chromatin during meiosis are significantly different than in mitotic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">As spermatogenesis progresses , there is a widespread reorganization of the haploid genome followed by extensive DNA compaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It has become increasingly clear that the dynamic composition of chromatin plays a critical role in the activities of enzymes and processes that act upon it .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , an analysis of the role of histone variants and modifications in these processes <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> shed light upon the mechanisms involved and the control of chromatin structure in general</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Histone variants such as histone H3.3 , H2AX , and macroH2A <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to play key roles in the various stages of spermiogenesis , in addition to the specifically modulated acetylation of histone H4 ( acH4 ) , ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B ( uH2A , uH2B ) , and phosphorylation of histone H3 ( H3p )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This review will examine recent discoveries concerning the role of histone modifications and variants during meiosis and spermatogenesis .</sentence>
