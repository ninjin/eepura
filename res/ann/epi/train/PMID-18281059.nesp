<sentence id="0">Crystal structures of the clock protein EA4 from the silkworm Bombyx mori .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Many insects pass the winter in an arrested developmental stage called diapause , either as eggs , as pupae , or even as adults .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Exposure to the prolonged cold of winter is required to permit awakening from diapause in the spring .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the diapause eggs of the silkworm Bombyx mori , a metalloglycoprotein , esterase A4 ( EA4 ) , has been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> to serve as a cold-duration clock</scope> because its characteristic ATPase activity is transiently elevated at the end of the necessary cold period .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This timer property of EA4 is known to start with the dissociation of an inhibitory peptide ( called " peptidyl inhibitory needle " ) under cold conditions , but its time-measuring mechanism is completely unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we present the crystal structures and functional properties of EA4 with and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> glycosylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that EA4 is a homodimeric ATPase , with each subunit consisting of a copper-zinc superoxide dismutase fold .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">There is an additional short N-terminal region that is capable of binding one more copper ion , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a timer mechanism in which this ion is involved</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The sugar chain <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to reinforce the binding of peptidyl inhibitory needle , which <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> in turn</scope> stabilize the initial conformation of the N-terminal domain , explaining the requirement for glycosylation and for the peptide to set the clock</scope> .</sentence>
