<sentence id="0">Role of glucosamine synthesis in the stimulation of TGF-alpha gene transcription by glucose and EGF .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transforming growth factor-alpha ( TGF-alpha ) gene transcription is regulated by both epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and glucose .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that the metabolism of glucose to glucosamine through the enzyme L-glutamine : D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase ( GFAT ) plays a critical role in the glucose signaling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this paper , we compared the role of GFAT in the glucose and EGF signals .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that , although EGF stimulates GFAT mRNA accumulation in MDA-MB-468 cells , this effect of EGF occurred several hours after TGF-alpha transcription increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">MDA-MB-468 cells also exhibited a TGF-alpha transcriptional response to low concentrations of glucose .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The TGF-alpha response to glucose but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> EGF</scope> could be inhibited by a blocker of GFAT activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Blockade of GFAT was confirmed by using Western blotting with the RL2 antibody , which recognizes an epitope on proteins containing N-acetylglucosamine .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Exposure of cells to glucose increased the RL2 signal on several polypeptides , but this change could be blocked by inhibition of GFAT .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results support the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">notion</cue> that glucose stimulation of TGF-alpha expression requires GFAT , but EGF stimulation does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue></scope></scope> .</sentence>
