<sentence id="0">Characterization of two novel proteins , NgRH1 and NgRH2 , structurally and biochemically homologous to the Nogo-66 receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nogo-66 receptor ( NgR ) has recently been identified as the neuronal receptor of the myelin-associated proteins Nogo-A , oligodendrocyte protein ( OMgp ) and myelin-associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) , and mediates inhibition of axonal regeneration both in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Through database searches , we have identified two novel proteins ( NgRH1 and NgRH2 ) that turned out to be homologous in their primary structures , biochemical properties and expression patterns to NgR .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Like NgR , the homologues contain eight leucine-rich repeats ( LRR ) flanked by a leucine-rich repeat C-terminus ( LRRCT ) and a leucine-rich repeat N-terminus ( LRRNT ) , and also have a C-terminal GPI signal sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Northern blot analysis showed predominant expression of NgRH1 and NgRH2 mRNA in the brain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on rat brain slices revealed neuronal expression of the genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">NgRH1 and NgRH2 were detected on the cell surface of recombinant cell lines as N-glycosylated GPI anchored proteins and , consistent with other GPI anchored proteins , were localized within the lipid rafts of cellular membranes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , an N-terminal proteolytic fragment of NgR comprising the majority of the ectodomain was found to be constitutively secreted from cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> NgR , NgRH1 and NgRH2 constitute a novel receptor protein family , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play related roles within the CNS</scope></scope> .</sentence>
