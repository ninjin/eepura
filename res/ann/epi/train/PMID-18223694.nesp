<sentence id="0">Chaperone-dependent stabilization and degradation of p53 mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">p53 missense mutant proteins commonly show increased stability compared to wild-type p53 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to depend largely on the inability of mutant p53 to induce the ubiquitin ligase MDM2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , recent work using mouse models has shown that the accumulation of mutant p53 occurs only in tumour cells , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> stabilization requires additional factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To clarify the stabilization of p53 mutants in tumours , we analysed factors that affect their folding and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although all missense mutants that we studied are more stable than wild-type p53 , the levels correlate with individual structural characteristics , <scope type="spec" id="2"> which <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be reflected in different gain-of-function properties</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of Hsp90 activity</scope> , the less stable unfolded p53 mutants preferentially associate in a complex with Hsp70 and CHIP ( carboxy terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein ) , and we show that CHIP is responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of these mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The demonstration of a complex interplay between Hsp90 , Hsp70 and CHIP that regulate the stability of different p53 mutant proteins improves our understanding of the pro-tumorigenic effects of increased Hsp90 activity during multi-stage carcinogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Understanding the roles of Hsp90 , Hsp70 and CHIP in cancers <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> also provide an important avenue through which to target p53 to enhance treatment of human cancers</scope> .</sentence>
