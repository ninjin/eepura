<sentence id="0">The role of oxidative stress in the long-term glycation of LDL .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Advanced glycation is a major pathway for the posttranslational modification of plasma and tissue proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The initiating reaction is the nonenzymatic addition of sugars such as glucose to the primary amino groups of proteins , i.e. , mainly to lysine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These " early " Schiff base and Amadori products then undergo a series of inter- and intramolecular rearrangements to produce the " late " products termed advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Incubation of LDL with glucose or glucose-6-phosphate produces AGE moieties on both the lipid and apolipoprotein B components .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , we tried to generate AGE-LDL by reaction with AGE-peptides ( < 10 kD ) obtained by enzymatic digestion of long-term glycated fibronectin as a model for connective tissue AGE-peptides .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">AGE-formation can be assessed by monitoring of fluorescence ( 370/440 nm ) which is easily differentiated from the much lower autofluorescence of oxidized low density lipoproteins ( oxLDL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Alternatively , AGE formation was detected by an AGE-specific ELISA using antibodies elicited in rabbits against bovine AGE-RNAse .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In the present study we investigated the influence of oxidative stress on the long-term glycation of LDL and the modulation of LDL-oxidation by AGE-modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We observed ( a ) that the rate of AGE formation is reduced by BHT/EDTA both on LDL and serum albumin ( glycation vs. glycoxidation ) , ( b ) long-term glycated LDL is more readily oxidized than unglycated LDL , ( c ) oxLDL is more prone to AGE-modification , ( d ) AGE-modification of LDL strongly alters its epitope spectrum and ( e ) that aminoguanidine at higher concentrations ( 1-10 mM ) inhibits copper-catalyzed LDL oxidation in the way of a classical antioxidant .</sentence>
