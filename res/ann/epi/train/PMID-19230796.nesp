<sentence id="0">The role of RAD6 in recombinational repair , checkpoints and meiosis via histone modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Rad6 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to interact with three separate ubiquitin ligase proteins ( Ubr1 , Rad18 , and Bre1 ) specific to different targets .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Rad6/Rad18 complex is central to translesion synthesis and the family of DNA transactions known as post-replication repair ( PRR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A less well-known aspect of Rad6-mediated DNA repair , however , involves its function with Bre1 in mono-ubiquitinating the histone H2B residue lysine 123 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we review how this ubiquitination impacts histone H3 methylation , and how this in turn impacts the DNA damage response .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In S. cerevisiae this pathway is required for checkpoint activation in G1 , and contributes to DNA repair via the homologous recombination pathway ( HRR ) in G2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , RAD6 clearly plays a role in HRR in addition to its central role in PRR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also summarize what is known about related repair pathways in other eukaryotes , including mammals .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Recent literature emphasizes the role of methylated histones in S. cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals in attracting the related DNA damage checkpoint proteins Rad9 , Crb2 and 53BP1 , respectively , to chromatin at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , the specific histone modification pathways involved diverge in these different eukaryotes .</sentence>
