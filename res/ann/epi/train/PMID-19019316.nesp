<sentence id="0">Muscular dystrophies due to glycosylation defects .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In the last few years , muscular dystrophies due to reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan ( ADG ) have emerged as a common group of conditions , now referred to as dystroglycanopathies .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Mutations in six genes ( POMT1 , POMT2 , POMGnT1 , Fukutin , FKRP and LARGE ) have so far been identified in patients with a dystroglycanopathy .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Allelic mutations in each of these genes can result in a wide spectrum of clinical conditions , ranging from severe congenital onset with associated structural brain malformations ( Walker Warburg syndrome ; muscle-eye-brain disease ; Fukuyama muscular dystrophy ; congenital muscular dystrophy type 1D ) to a relatively milder congenital variant with no brain involvement ( congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C ) , and to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy ( LGMD ) type 2 variants with onset in childhood or adult life ( LGMD2I , LGMD2L , and LGMD2N ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">ADG is a peripheral membrane protein that undergoes multiple and complex glycosylation steps to regulate its ability to effectively interact with extracellular matrix proteins , such as laminin , agrin , and perlecan .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although <scope type="spec" id="0"> the precise composition of the glycans present on ADG are <cue type="spec" id="0">not known</cue></scope> , it has been demonstrated that the forced overexpression of LARGE , or its paralog LARGE2 , is capable of increasing the glycosylation of ADG in normal cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , its overexpression is capable of restoring dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding properties in primary cell cultures of patients affected by different genetically defined dystroglycanopathy variants .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These observations <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that there <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> be a role for therapeutic strategies to overcome the glycosylation defect in these conditions via the overexpression of LARGE</scope></scope> .</sentence>
