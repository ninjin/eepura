<sentence id="0">Conversion of inactive glycosylation inhibiting factor to bioactive derivatives by modification of a SH group .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human glycosylation inhibiting factor ( rhGIF ) contains three cysteine residues ( Cys-57 , -60 , and -81 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">All SH groups in the cysteine residues are free , and the GIF molecule had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> biologic activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Carboxymethylation of the SH group of Cys-60 in the molecule resulted in the generation of bioactivity , although the activity of the carboxymethylated GIF was 10- to 20-fold less than that of suppressor T cell (Ts)-derived GIF .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , treatment of the inactive rhGIF with ethylmercurithiosalicylate or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid ) ( DTNB ) resulted in the generation of derivatives whose bioactivity was comparable to that of the Ts-derived bioactive GIF .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The activity of these derivatives was lost by treatment with DTT .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Isolation and chemical analysis of the DTNB-treated GIF derivative revealed that binding the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid group with Cys-60 was responsible for the generation of the highly bioactive derivative .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Inactive cytosolic GIF from mammalian cells could also be converted to bioactive derivative by treatment with the SH reagent , while Ts-derived bioactive GIF was inactivated by DTT .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results , together with an x-ray crystal structure of GIF molecules , strongly <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the generation of bioactivity of GIF in Ts cells is due to posttranslational modifications that result in conformational changes in the molecule</scope> .</sentence>
