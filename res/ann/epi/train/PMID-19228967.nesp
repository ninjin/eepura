<sentence id="0">The cochaperone BAG2 sweeps paired helical filament- insoluble tau from the microtubule .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tau inclusions are a prominent feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer 's disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Their accumulation in neurons as ubiquitinated filaments <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> a failure in the degradation limb of the Tau pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The components of a Tau protein triage system consisting of CHIP/Hsp70 and other chaperones have begun to emerge .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , the site of triage and the master regulatory elements are unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we report an elegant mechanism of Tau degradation involving the cochaperone BAG2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The BAG2/Hsp70 complex is tethered to the microtubule and this complex can capture and deliver Tau to the proteasome for ubiquitin-independent degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This complex preferentially degrades Sarkosyl insoluble Tau and phosphorylated Tau .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">BAG2 levels in cells are under the physiological control of the microRNA miR-128a , which can tune paired helical filament Tau levels in neurons .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that ubiquitinated Tau inclusions arise due to shunting of Tau degradation toward a less efficient ubiquitin-dependent pathway</scope> .</sentence>
