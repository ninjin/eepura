<sentence id="0">CHIP facilitates ubiquitination of inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes its proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) is responsible for nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis from l-arginine in response to inflammatory mediators .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is reported that iNOS is degraded mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in RAW264.7 cells and human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we showed that iNOS was ubiquitinated and degraded dependent on CHIP ( COOH terminus of heat shock protein 70-interacting protein ) , a chaperone-dependent ubiquitin ligase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The results from overexpression and RNAi experiments demonstrated that CHIP decreased the protein level of iNOS , shortened the half-life of iNOS and attenuated the production of NO .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , CHIP promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of iNOS by associating with iNOS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that CHIP plays an important role in regulation iNOS activity</scope> .</sentence>
