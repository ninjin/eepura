<sentence id="0">Transferrin-directed internalization and cycling of transferrin receptor 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transferrin receptor 2 ( TfR2 ) is a homologue of transferrin receptor 1 ( TfR1 ) but has distinct functions from TfR1 in iron homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In keeping with its proposed role in iron sensing , previous studies showed that TfR2 has a short half-life and that holo-Tf stabilizes TfR2 by redirecting it from a degradative pathway to a recycling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we characterized how the endocytosis , recycling and degradation of TfR2 relates to its function and differs from TfR1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TfR2 endocytosis was adaptor protein-2 ( AP-2 ) dependent .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Flow cytometry analysis showed that TfR1 and TfR2 utilized the same endocytic pathway only in the presence of holo-Tf , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> holo-Tf alters the interaction of TfR2 with the endocytic machinery</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Unlike TfR1 , phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 ( PACS-1 ) binds to the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 and data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that PACS-1 is involved in the TfR2 recycling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Depletion of TSG101 by siRNA or expression of a dominant negative Vps4 inhibited TfR2 degradation , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> TfR2 degradation occurs through a multivesicular body ( MVB ) pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="neg" id="3">TfR2 degradation is <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> mediated through ubiquitination on the single lysine ( K31 ) in the cytoplasmic domain or on the amino terminal residue</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">No</cue> ubiquitination of TfR2 by HA-ubiquitin was detected</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating</cue> a <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">lack</cue> of direct TfR2 ubiquitination involvement in its degradation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
