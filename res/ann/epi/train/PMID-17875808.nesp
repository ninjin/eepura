<sentence id="0">A chemical biology screen identifies glucocorticoids that regulate c-maf expression by increasing its proteasomal degradation through up-regulation of ubiquitin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The oncogene c-maf is frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cell lines and patient samples and contributes to increased cellular proliferation in part by inducing cyclin D2 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To identify regulators of c-maf , we developed a chemical screen in NIH3T3 cells stably overexpressing c-maf and the cyclin D2 promoter driving luciferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">From a screen of 2400 off-patent drugs and chemicals , we identified glucocorticoids as c-maf-dependent inhibitors of cyclin D2 transactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In multiple myeloma cell lines , glucocorticoids reduced levels of c-maf protein without influencing corresponding mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Subsequent studies demonstrated that glucocorticoids increased ubiquitination-dependent degradation of c-maf and up-regulated ubiquitin C mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , ectopic expression of ubiquitin C recapitulated the effects of glucocorticoids , demonstrating regulation of c-maf protein through the abundance of the ubiquitin substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , using a chemical biology approach , we identified a novel mechanism of action of glucocorticoids and a novel mechanism by which levels of c-maf protein are regulated by the abundance of the ubiquitin substrate .</sentence>
