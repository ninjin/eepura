<sentence id="2">The logical target of protective antibody responses elicited by potential HIV vaccines <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">should</cue> be the viral Env spike on the surface of the virion</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the potency and titers of neutralizing antibodies that arise during HIV infection are generally discouragingly low and the antibodies that do arise recognize mainly autologous virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="1"> This is <cue type="spec" id="1">thought</cue> to be a result of a combination of immunodominance of hypervariable regions of the Env protein that can easily escape neutralization , antibody reactivity to gp160 " decoy " protein in cell surface debris or monomeric gp120 , conformational constraints within the Env trimer that create unfavorable antibody binding conditions and extensive glycosylation of the exposed regions of Env within the trimer</scope> .</sentence>
