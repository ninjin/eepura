<sentence id="1">Promoter recruitment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex is required for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of several genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">SAGA is targeted to promoters through interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional activators and facilitates preinitiation-complex assembly and transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that the 19S proteasome regulatory particle ( 19S RP ) alters SAGA to stimulate its interaction with transcriptional activators .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The ATPase components of the 19S RP are required for stimulation of SAGA/activator interactions and enhance SAGA recruitment to promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Proteasomal ATPases genetically interact with SAGA , and their inhibition reduces global histone H3 acetylation levels and SAGA recruitment to target promoters in vivo .</sentence>
