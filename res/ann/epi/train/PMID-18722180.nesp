<sentence id="0">The unique N terminus of the UbcH10 E2 enzyme controls the threshold for APC activation and enhances checkpoint regulation of the APC .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In vitro , the anaphase-promoting complex ( APC ) E3 ligase functions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of the E2-C and Ubc4/5 families to ubiquitinate substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , only the use of the E2-C family , notably UbcH10 , is genetically well validated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we biochemically demonstrate preferential use of UbcH10 by the APC , specified by the E2 core domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Importantly , an additional E2-E3 interaction mediated by the N-terminal extension of UbcH10 regulates APC activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutating the highly conserved N terminus increases substrate ubiquitination and the number of substrate lysines targeted , allows ubiquitination of APC substrates lacking their destruction boxes , increases resistance to the APC inhibitors Emi1 and BubR1 in vitro , and bypasses the spindle checkpoint in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Fusion of the UbcH10 N terminus to UbcH5 restricts ubiquitination activity but does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> direct specific interactions with the APC</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , UbcH10 combines a specific E2-E3 interface and regulation via its N-terminal extension to limit APC activity for substrate selection and checkpoint control .</sentence>
