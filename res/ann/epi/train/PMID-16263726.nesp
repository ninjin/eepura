<sentence id="0">Human but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> yeast CHD1 binds directly and selectively to histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 via its tandem chromodomains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Defining the protein factors that directly recognize post-translational , covalent histone modifications is essential toward understanding the impact of these chromatin " marks " on gene regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the current study , we identify human CHD1 , an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein , as a factor that directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In vitro binding studies identified that CHD1 recognizes di- and trimethyl H3K4 with a dissociation constant ( Kd ) of approximately 5 microm , whereas monomethyl H3K4 binds CHD1 with a 3-fold lower affinity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Surprisingly , human CHD1 binds to methylated H3K4 in a manner that requires both of its tandem chromodomains .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In vitro analyses demonstrate that unlike human CHD1 , yeast Chd1 does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> bind methylated H3K4</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> yeast and human CHD1 have diverged in their ability to discriminate covalently modified histones and link histone modification-recognition and non-covalent chromatin remodeling activities within a single human protein</scope> .</sentence>
