<sentence id="0">FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase enzyme that regulates the transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mammalian cells adapt to hypoxic conditions through a transcriptional response pathway mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor , HIF .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HIF transcriptional activity is suppressed under normoxic conditions by hydroxylation of an asparagine residue within its C-terminal transactivation domain , blocking association with coactivators .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that the protein FIH-1 , previously shown to interact with HIF , is an asparaginyl hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Like known hydroxylase enzymes , FIH-1 is an Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that uses molecular O(2) to modify its substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Together with the recently discovered prolyl hydroxylases that regulate HIF stability , this class of oxygen-dependent enzymes comprises critical regulatory components of the hypoxic response pathway .</sentence>
