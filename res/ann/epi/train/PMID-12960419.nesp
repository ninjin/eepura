<sentence id="0">Requirement for neo1p in retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Neo1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential P-type ATPase and potential aminophospholipid translocase ( flippase ) in the Drs2p family .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have previously implicated Drs2p in protein transport steps in the late secretory pathway requiring ADP-ribosylation factor ( ARF ) and clathrin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we present evidence that epitope-tagged Neo1p localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi complex and is required for a retrograde transport pathway between these organelles .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using conditional alleles of NEO1 , we find that loss of Neo1p function causes cargo-specific defects in anterograde protein transport early in the secretory pathway and perturbs glycosylation in the Golgi complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Rer1-GFP , a protein that cycles between the ER and Golgi complex in COPI and COPII vesicles , is mislocalized to the vacuole in neo1-ts at the nonpermissive temperature .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These phenotypes <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the anterograde protein transport defect is a secondary consequence of a defect in a COPI-dependent retrograde pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that loss of lipid asymmetry in the cis Golgi perturbs retrograde protein transport to the ER</scope> .</sentence>
