<sentence id="0">Transforming growth factor beta 1 influences lysyl hydroxylation of collagen I and reduces steady-state levels of lysyl hydroxylase mRNA in human osteoblast-like cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1 ) is an osteotropic growth factor that is found in substantial concentration in bone .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The authors studied the influence of TGF-beta 1 on the modification of lysine residues of collagen I. The degree of lysyl hydroxylation and lysyl glycosylation of newly synthesized collagen as well as steady-state levels of mRNA for both lysyl hydroxylase and collagens I and III were determined in human osteoblast-like cells in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In normal human osteoblasts lysyl hydroxylation was decreased by TGF-beta 1 particularly in the collagen alpha 2-chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This effect was paralleled by an increase in lysyl residues , whereas <scope type="neg" id="0">glycosylation was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The mRNA for lysyl hydroxylase was reduced by one-third under the influence of TGF-beta 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , the mRNAs for both procollagen I alpha-chains were stimulated by TGF-beta 1 , whereas pro alpha 1 (III)-mRNA showed a decrease .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Changes in the local regulatory activity of TGF-beta 1 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play a role in matrix maturation such as collagen type production and lysyl hydroxylation , the latter being altered in various pathological conditions , e.g. in generalized osteopenia</scope> .</sentence>
