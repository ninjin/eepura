<sentence id="1"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">Histones</cue> and histone acetylation have been investigated during three stages of Drosophila hydei embryogenesis--early gastrula , late gastrula and organogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">No</cue> essential changes in the electrophoretic pattern of the histones have been revealed during the stages examined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , we established an enhanced level of [14C]acetate incorporation at the time of extensive gene activation during gastrulation as well as some quantitative differences in the pattern of acetylation during gastrula and organogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We consider most of them to be related to chromatin assembly during the stage of gastrulation and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the correlation between histone acetylation and gene activity during Drosophila embryogenesis concerns histone H3 acetylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The involvement of both acetylation and deacetylation in the steady-state acetylation level has been examined as well .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have found that the higher acetyltransferase activity is responsible for the enhanced level of acetate incorporation during gastrulation .</sentence>
