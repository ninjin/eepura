<sentence id="0">Control of CBP co-activating activity by arginine methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The histone acetyltransferases CREB binding protein ( CBP ) and the related p300 protein function as key transcriptional co-activators in multiple pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the case of transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors , ligand promotes the recruitment of co-activators of the p160 family , such as GRIP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Subsequently , the p160 co-activators recruit other co-activators via two activation domains , AD1 and AD2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">AD1 binds CBP or p300 , whereas AD2 has been shown to activate transcription through the recruitment of the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Recently , the KIX domain of CBP has been shown to be methylated by CARM1 in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Here , we report that another domain of CBP is specifically methylated by CARM1 on conserved arginine residues in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also provide functional evidence that arginine residues methylated by CARM1 play a critical role in GRIP-1-dependent transcriptional activation and in hormone-induced gene activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Altogether , our data provide strong evidence that arginine methylation represents an important mechanism for modulating co-activator transcriptional activity .</sentence>
