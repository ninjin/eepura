<sentence id="0">The cholinesterase-like domain , essential in thyroglobulin trafficking for thyroid hormone synthesis , is required for protein dimerization .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The carboxyl-terminal cholinesterase-like ( ChEL ) domain of thyroglobulin ( Tg ) has been identified as critically important in Tg export from the endoplasmic reticulum .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In a number of human kindreds suffering from congenital hypothyroidism , and in the cog congenital goiter mouse and rdw rat dwarf models , thyroid hormone synthesis is inhibited because of mutations in the ChEL domain that block protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesize</cue> that Tg forms homodimers through noncovalent interactions involving two predicted alpha-helices in each ChEL domain that are homologous to the dimerization helices of acetylcholinesterase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This has been explored through selective epitope tagging of dimerization partners and by inserting an extra , unpaired Cys residue to create an opportunity for intermolecular disulfide pairing .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that the ChEL domain is necessary and sufficient for Tg dimerization ; specifically , the isolated ChEL domain can dimerize with full-length Tg or with itself .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Insertion of an N-linked glycan into the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> upstream</scope> dimerization helix inhibits homodimerization of the isolated ChEL domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , interestingly , co-expression of upstream Tg domains , either in cis or in trans , overrides the dimerization defect of such a mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , although the ChEL domain provides a nidus for Tg dimerization , interactions of upstream Tg regions with the ChEL domain actively stabilizes the Tg dimer complex for intracellular transport .</sentence>
