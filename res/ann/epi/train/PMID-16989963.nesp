<sentence id="0">Control of human cytomegalovirus gene expression by differential histone modifications during lytic and latent infection of a monocytic cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Non-differentiated THP-1 cells can be infected by human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) Towne strain , which persists in these cells in a non-active ( latent ) form <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> undergoing a productive cycle</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The same cells become permissive for HCMV lytic infection after induction of cell differentiation by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We used this cellular model to study the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> role of histone modifications in the control of HCMV latency</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against histone H3 acetylated or dimethylated in position K9 , we demonstrated that in lytically infected cells the HCMV enhancer was associated with heavy acetylated but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> dimethylated H3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the case of latent infection , the HCMV enhancer was associated with <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">neither</cue> acetylated <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">nor</cue> dimethylated H3</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">HCMV genes encoding DNA polymerase ( early ) , pp65 ( early-late ) and pp150 ( late ) proteins were associated preferentially with acetylated H3 in lytically infected cells and with dimethylated H3 in latently infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data strongly <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that K9 methylation of H3 is involved in HCMV gene repression , while association of the above genes with acetylated histones is <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">likely</cue> to be necessary for active transcription</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="7"> It <cue type="spec" id="7">can</cue> be postulated that the same histone modifications are used to mark active and repressed genes in both cellular and viral chromatin</scope> .</sentence>
