<sentence id="0">Molecular cloning of ESET , a novel histone H3-specific methyltransferase that interacts with ERG transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The ets-related gene erg encodes a transcription factor that is implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To identify interacting partners of ERG , we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library constructed from mouse hematopoietic cells using the N-terminal region of ERG as a bait .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We isolated a 4.6 kb full-length mouse cDNA encoding a 1307-amino acid protein migrating as a 180 kD band , which was termed ESET ( ERG-associated protein with SET domain ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">ESET is 92 % identical to the human protein SETDB1 ( SET domain , bifurcated 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The interaction between ESET and ERG was supported by in vitro pull-down using glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) fusion protein , by transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments , and by association of endogenous SETDB1 with ERG .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Since ESET possesses evolutionarily conserved SET , preSET , and postSET domains implicated in histone methylation , we tested the ability of ESET to methylate core histones .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results of these studies demonstrated that ESET is a histone H3-specific methyltransferase , and that mutations within ESET abolished its methyltransferase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , these findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">raise the</cue> possibility that transcription factor ERG <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> participate in transcriptional regulation through ESET-mediated histone methylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
