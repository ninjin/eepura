<sentence id="0">Dual role of Zn2+ in maintaining structural integrity and suppressing deacetylase activity of SIRT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Zn(2+) directly participates in catalysis of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) Classes I , II , IV enzymes while its role in HDAC Class III activity is not well established .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Herein we investigated the effects of Zn(2+) on the deacetylase activity of sirtuin 1 ( silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 , SIRT1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that the inherent Zn(2+) at the zinc-finger motif of SIRT1 is essential for the structural integrity and the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 , whereas the exogenous Zn(2+) strongly inhibits the deacetylase activity with an IC(50) of 0.82muM for Zn(Gly)(2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">SIRT1 activity suppressed by the exogenous Zn(2+) can be fully recovered by the metal chelator EDTA but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> by the activator resveratrol</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also identified Zn(2+) as a noncompetitive inhibitor for the substrates of NAD(+) and the acetyl peptide P53-AMC .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid ( ANS ) fluorescence titration experiments and site-directed mutagenesis study <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that the exogenous Zn(2+) binds to SIRT1 but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> at the zinc-finger motif</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> Zn(2+) plays a dual role in SIRT1 activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Inherent Zn(2+) at the zinc-finger motif is structurally related and essential for SIRT1 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">On the other hand , Zn(2+) <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> also bind to another site different from the zinc-finger motif or the binding sites for the substrates or resveratrol and act as a potent inhibitor of SIRT1</scope> .</sentence>
