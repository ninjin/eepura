<sentence id="0">Altered glycosylation and selected mutation in recombinant human complement component C9 : effects on haemolytic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recombinant wild-type and mutated forms of human complement component C9 have been synthesized in baculovirus-infected insect cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Wild-type recombinant C9 was indistinguishable from native C9 , as judged by haemolytic activity , trypsin and alpha-thrombin digestion , reaction with antibodies to C9 , enzymatic deglycosylation to the same core size and polymerization in the presence of Zn2+ .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Replacement of the native signal peptide with the honey-bee melittin signal peptide , and replacement of Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf9 ) cells with Trichoplusia ni cells produced yields of 5 micrograms C9/ml supernatant .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Three C9 mutants were generated ; one mutant , with four acidic residues changed to alanines in a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> calcium-binding site</scope> , had the same biological activity as recombinant C9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Another mutant , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacking</cue> 23 N-terminal amino acids</scope> , previously showing increased polymerization when produced in vitro , polymerized on secretion , rendering it inactive .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It was not <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> to demonstrate haemolytic activity of the third mutant , cysteines 33 and</scope> 36 mutated to alanine , as it was secreted a hundredfold less than the wild-type protein .</sentence>
