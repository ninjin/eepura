<sentence id="0">Gene dissection demonstrates that the Escherichia coli cysG gene encodes a multifunctional protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The C-terminus of the Escherichia coli CysG protein , consisting of amino acids 202-457 , was expressed as a recombinant protein using gene dissection methodology .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Analysis of the activity of this truncated protein , termed CysGA , revealed that it was able to methylate uroporphyrinogen III in the same S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent manner as the complete CysG protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , this truncated protein was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> able to complement E. coli cysG cells</scope> , thereby <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that the first 201 amino acids of the CysG protein had an enzymic activity associated with the conversion of dihydrosirohydrochlorin into sirohaem</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis of the N-terminus of the CysG protein revealed the presence of a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> pyridine dinucleotide binding site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When the purified CysG protein was incubated with NADP+ , uroporphyrinogen III and SAM the enzyme was found to catalyse a coenzyme-mediated dehydrogenation to form sirohydrochlorin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The CysGA protein on the other hand showed <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> such coenzyme-dependent activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Analysis of the porphyrinoid material isolated from strains harbouring plasmids containing the complete and truncated cysG genes <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggested</cue> that the CysG protein was also involved in ferrochelation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The evidence presented in this paper <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that the CysG protein is a multifunctional protein involved in SAM-dependent methylation , pyridine dinucleotide dependent dehydrogenation and ferrochelation</scope> .</sentence>
