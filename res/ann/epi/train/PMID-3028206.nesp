<sentence id="0">Accurate , quantitative assays for the hydrolysis of soluble type I , II , and III 3H-acetylated collagens by bacterial and tissue collagenases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Accurate and quantitative assays for the hydrolysis of soluble 3H-acetylated rat tendon type I , bovine cartilage type II , and human amnion type III collagens by both bacterial and tissue collagenases have been developed .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The assays are carried out at any temperature in the 1-30 degrees C range in a single reaction tube and the progress of the reaction is monitored by withdrawing aliquots as a function of time , quenching with 1,10-phenanthroline , and quantitation of the concentration of hydrolysis fragments .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The latter is achieved by selective denaturation of these fragments by incubation under conditions described in the previous paper of this issue .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The assays give percentages of hydrolysis of all three collagen types by neutrophil collagenase that agree well with the results of gel electrophoresis experiments .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The initial rates of hydrolysis of all three collagens are proportional to the concentration of both neutrophil or Clostridial collagenases over a 10-fold range of enzyme concentrations .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">All three assays can be carried out at collagen concentrations .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">that range from 0.06 to 2 mg/ml and give linear double reciprocal plots for both tissue and bacterial collagenases that can be used to evaluate the kinetic parameters Km and kcat or Vmax .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The assay developed for the hydrolysis of rat type I collagen by neutrophil collagenase is shown to be more sensitive by at least one order of magnitude than comparable assays that use rat type I collagen fibrils or gels as substrate .</sentence>
