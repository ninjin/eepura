<sentence id="0">Protein glycosylation in a heat-resistant rat fibroblast cell model expressing human HSP70 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Thermotolerance and heat resistance are frequently associated with elevated levels of heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Elevated heat resistance is also found to be associated with the overexpression of high levels of HSP70 , as seen in M21 cells , derived from the Rat-1 line .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study , we report that M21 cells also feature an increase in general protein glycosylation and specific expression of the stress glycoprotein , GP62 , both of which correlate with cellular heat resistance .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The expression of GP50 , a major stress glycoprotein in cell lines such as CHO , however , did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> correlate with cellular heat resistance in M21 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Protein glycosylation that occurs during acute heat stress ( " prompt " glycosylation ) was associated with the glycosylation of a major " prompt " stress glycoprotein , P-SG64 ( M(r) of 64,000 ) , that was identified by immunoblotting as a glycosylated form of calreticulin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The higher level of protein glycosylation in M21 cells correlated well with increased D-[2-3H]mannose incorporation into precursor pools of dolichyl phosphomannose and dolichyl pyrophosphoryl oligosaccharides and into glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , heat resistance in M21 cells is associated not only with expression of high levels of HSP70 , but also with a concomitant increase in protein glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">support</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesis</cue> that stress-induced protein glycosylation is a component of cellular stress response</scope> , either in association with HSPs or as an independent mechanism</scope> .</sentence>
