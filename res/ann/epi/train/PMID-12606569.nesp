<sentence id="1"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">Successful</cue> maturation</scope> determines the intracellular fate of secretory and membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Failure of proteins to fold or assemble properly can lead to their retention in the ER and redirects them to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Proteasome inhibitors can yield deglycosylated cytoplasmic intermediates that are the result of an N-glycanase activity , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">believed</cue> to act prior to destruction of these substrates by the proteasome</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A gene encoding a yeast peptide:N-glycanase , PNG1 , has been cloned , but this N-glycanase and its mammalian homolog were reported to be incapable of deglycosylating full-length glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that both the yeast PNG1 enzyme and its mammalian homolog display N-glycanase activity towards intact glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As substrates , cytosolic PNGase activity prefers proteins containing high-mannose over those bearing complex type oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Importantly , PNG1 discriminates between non-native and folded glycoproteins , consistent with a role for N-glycanase in cytoplasmic turnover of glycoproteins .</sentence>
