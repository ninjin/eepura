<sentence id="0">The inactivation of bovine cathepsin B by novel N-chloro-acetyl-dipeptides : application of the Houghten ' tea bag ' methodology to inhibitor synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this study , a series of N-chloro-acetylated dipeptides were synthesised by the application of Houghten 's methodology of multiple analog peptide syntheses ( MAPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The peptides , all of which contain a C-terminal free acid , were tested as inactivators of bovine cathepsin B , in an attempt at exploiting the known and , amongst the cysteine proteinases , unique carboxy dipeptidyl peptidase activity of the protease .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have succeeded in obtaining a number of effective inactivators , the most potent of which-chloroacetyl-Leu-Leu-OH , inactivates the enzyme with an apparent second-order rate constant of 3.8 x 10(4)M(-1)min(-1) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , the esterified analog , chloroacetyl-Leu-Leu-OMe , inactivates the enzyme some three orders of magnitude less efficiently , lending credence to our thesis that a free carboxylic acid moiety is an important determinant for inhibitor effectiveness .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This preliminary study has highlighted a number of interesting features about the specificity requirements of the bovine proteinase and we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">believe</cue> that our approach has great potential for the rapid delineation of the subsite specificities of cathepsin B-like proteases from various species</scope> .</sentence>
