<sentence id="0">Complications in the assignment of 14 and 28 Da mass shift detected by mass spectrometry as in vivo methylation from endogenous proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Identification of protein methylation sites typically starts with database searching of MS/MS spectra of proteolytic digest of the target protein by allowing addition of 14 and 28 Da in the selected amino acid residues that can be methylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Despite the progress in our understanding of lysine and arginine methylation , <scope type="spec" id="0"> substrates and functions of protein methylation at other amino acid residues remain <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report the analysis of protein methylation for p53 , SMC3 , iNOS , and MeCP2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that a large number of peptides can be modified on the lysine , arginine , histidine , and glutamic acid residues with a mass increase of 14 or 28 Da , consistent with methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Surprisingly , a majority of which did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> demonstrate a corresponding mass shift when cells were cultured with isotope-labeled methionine , a precursor for the synthesis of S-adenosyl-l-methionine ( SAM ) , which is the most commonly used methyl donor for protein methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibility</cue> of either exogenous protein methylation during sample handling and processing for mass spectrometry or the existence of SAM-independent pathways for protein methylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our study found a high occurrence of protein methylation from SDS-PAGE isolated endogenous proteins and identified complications for assigning such modifications as in vivo methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This study provides a cautionary note for solely relying on mass shift for mass spectrometric identification of protein methylation and highlights the importance of in vivo isotope labeling as a necessary validation method .</sentence>
