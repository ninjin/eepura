<sentence id="0">A simple , sensitive in vitro assay for cytoplasmic deglycosylation by peptide : N-glycanase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A cytoplasmic peptide : N-glycanase ( PNGase ) has been implicated in the proteasomal degradation of aberrant glycoproteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The reaction is <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be important for subsequent proteolysis by the proteasome since bulky N-glycan chains on misfolded glycoproteins</scope> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> impair their efficient entry into the interior of the cylinder-shaped 20S proteasome , where its active site resides</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This cytoplasmic enzyme was first detected in 1993 by a simple , sensitive assay method using 14C-labeled glycopeptide as a substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The deglycosylation reaction by PNGase brings about two major changes on substrate the peptide ; one is removal of the N-glycan chain and the other is the introduction of a negative charge into the core peptide by converting the glycosylated asparagine residue(s) into an aspartic acid residue(s) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The assay method we developed monitors these major changes in the core peptide , and the respective changes were detected by distinct analytical methods : i.e. , paper chromatography and paper electrophoresis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This chapter will describe the simple , sensitive in vitro assay method for PNGase .</sentence>
