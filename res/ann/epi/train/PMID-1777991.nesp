<sentence id="0">Glycosylation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in relation to duration of disease in acute and chronic infection and inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Microheterogeneity of acute phase proteins frequently differs in acute and chronic types of inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , it is unknown <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> these changes depend on the duration of the inflammation in a given disease</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We therefore investigated the microheterogeneity of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein ( AGP ) in sera from patients with acute and chronic bacterial infection in comparison to rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In acute bacterial infection Con A-reactivity of AGP was significantly elevated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By contrast , AGP in chronic bacterial infection showed the same glycosylation pattern as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis being characterized by a decreased reactivity to Con A. Serial measurements in individual patients with bacterial infections showed a transition from the initially elevated to decreased reactivity to Con A as the disease became chronic .</sentence>
