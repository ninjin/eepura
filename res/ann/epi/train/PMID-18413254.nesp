<sentence id="0">Biochemical and biophysical analyses of Ras modification by ubiquitin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ras proteins are small GTPases that play key roles in the regulation of several cellular processes such as growth , differentiation , and transformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although Ras signaling was <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to occur uniformly on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane</scope> , a growing body of evidence <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates that</cue> Ras activation happens dynamically within defined plasma membrane microdomains and at other specific intracellular compartments , thus ensuring the generation of distinct signal outputs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Yet the mechanisms that control the spatiotemporal segregation of Ras proteins remain poorly characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have recently shown that the differential modification of Ras proteins by ubiquitination is a crucial factor that controls Ras intracellular trafficking and signaling potential .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To better understand the process of Ras ubiquitination , it is important to establish assays that not only provide information about the nature of the ubiquitin modification involved , but also enable the monitoring of the dynamics of this process .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In this chapter , we will describe biochemical and biophysical methodologies , namely immunoprecipitation , nickel-chelate affinity chromatography , and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ( BRET ) , for monitoring the ubiquitination of Ras proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Although the description focuses on Ras , the assays described can in principle be applied to the study of a range of proteins of interest that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be subject to ubiquitination</scope> , and the use of the different methods in parallel <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">should</cue> provide new insights into the nature and dynamics of protein ubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
