<sentence id="0"><scope type="neg" id="0">Small interfering RNAs that trigger posttranscriptional gene silencing are <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for the histone H3 Lys9 methylation necessary for transgenic tandem repeat stabilization in Neurospora crassa</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In Neurospora crassa , the introduction of a transgene can lead to small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated posttranscriptional gene silencing ( PTGS ) of homologous genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">siRNAs can also guide locus-specific methylation of Lys9 of histone H3 ( Lys9H3 ) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we tested the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that transgenically derived siRNAs <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> contemporaneously both activate the PTGS mechanism and induce chromatin modifications at the transgene and the homologous endogenous gene</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation using a previously characterized albino-1 ( al-1 ) silenced strain but detected <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> alterations in the pattern of histone modifications at the endogenous al-1 locus</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that siRNAs produced from the transgenic locus do <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> trigger modifications in trans of those histones tested</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Instead , we found that the transgenic locus was hypermethylated at Lys9H3 in our silenced strain and remained hypermethylated in the quelling defective mutants ( qde ) , further demonstrating that the PTGS machinery is dispensable for Lys9H3 methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , we found that a mutant in the histone Lys9H3 methyltransferase dim-5 was <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">unable</cue> to maintain PTGS , with transgenic copies being rapidly lost</scope> , resulting in reversion of the silenced phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">indicate that</cue> the defect in PTGS of the Deltadim-5 strain is due to the inability to maintain the transgene in tandem</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggesting</cue> a role for DIM-5 in stabilizing such repeated sequences</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that in Neurospora , siRNAs produced from the transgenic locus are used in the RNA-induced silencing complex-mediated PTGS pathway and do <scope type="neg" id="9"><cue type="neg" id="9">not</cue> communicate with an RNAi-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing complex to effect chromatin-based silencing</scope> .</sentence>
