<sentence id="0">BasT , a membrane-bound transducer protein for amino acid detection in Halobacterium salinarum .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Halophilic archaea , such as eubacteria , use methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins ( MCPs ) to sense their environment .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show here that BasT is a halobacterial transducer protein ( Htp ) responsible for chemotaxis towards five attractant amino acids .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The C-terminus of the protein exhibits the highly conserved regions that are diagnostic for MCPs : the signalling domain for communication with the histidine kinase and the methylation sites that interact with the methylation/demethylation enzymes for adaptation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Hydropathy analysis predicts an enterobacterial-type transducer protein topology for BasT , with an extracellular <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> ligand-binding domain</scope> flanked by two transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">BasT-inactivated mutant cells are missing a membrane protein radiolabelled with L-[methyl-3H]-methionine in wild-type cells , confirming that BasT is methylatable and membrane bound .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Behavioural analysis of the basT mutant cells by capillary and chemical-in-plug assays demonstrates complete loss of chemotactic responses towards five ( leucine , isoleucine , valine , methionine and cysteine ) of the six attractant amino acids for Halobacterium salinarum , whereas they still respond to arginine .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The volatile methyl group production assays also corroborate these findings and confirm that BasT signalling induces methyl group turnover .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our data identify BasT as the chemotaxis transducer protein for the branched chain amino acids leucine , isoleucine and valine as well as for methionine and cysteine .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , BasT and the arginine sensor Car cover the entire spectrum of chemotactic responses towards attractant amino acids in H. salinarum .</sentence>
