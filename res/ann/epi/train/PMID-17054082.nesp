<sentence id="0">Assessing the instability of the isoelectric focusing patterns of erythropoietin in urine .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IEF can be used to differentiate human urinary erythropoietin ( uEPO ) , recombinant human erythropoietin or epoetin ( rEPO ) and darbepoetin ( novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein ( NESP ) ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This is the basis of the method currently used to detect misuse of rEPO and NESP by elite athletes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , an <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> activity</scope> has been attributed to some urine samples ( denominated ' unstable ' urine by the World Anti-Doping Agency ; WADA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This activity has shown to give rise to artefactual profiles for both rEPO and NESP when incubated with such urine and , thus , raised concerns with respect to doping control .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have evaluated which charges produce the characteristic IEF profiles of uEPO , rEPO and NESP and how these profiles respond to distinct enzymatic reactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">From sialidase digestions it became evident that only uEPO contains charges different from sialic acid , and a comparison of all substances after complete de-N-glycosylation localized these charges in the carbohydrate moiety .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Partial desialylation , or digestion with arylsulfatase from Helix pomatia yielded profiles for recombinants species similar to those observed for unstable urine samples .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The contributions from our studies to the anti-doping problem include : ( i ) protocols that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> corroborate the potential misuse of rEPO or NESP based on the particular enzymatic activity of an arylsulfatase preparation</scope> , or a broad-specificity sialidase ; ( ii ) assurance that the instability observed in some urine samples <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> only result from false-negatives , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> from false-positive testing</scope></scope> ; and ( iii ) a simple remedy to prevent an unstable urine from altering the IEF profile by adding selective competitive substrates .</sentence>
