<sentence id="0">Preferential transfer to truncated oligosaccharides to the first sequon of yeast exoglucanase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae alg3 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In addition to the exoglucanases ( Exg ) secreted into the culture medium by wild type cells , ExgIa and ExgIb , which have oligosaccharides attached to both <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> N-glycosylation sites</scope> , Saccharomyces cerevisiae alg3 mutant secreted substantial amounts ( 35--44 % ) of underglycosylated and unglycosylated forms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Quantification of these forms <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> no more than 78 % of the available N-sites were occupied</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">About 50 % of the transferred oligosaccharides were endo H sensitive , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> the lipid-linked precursor had completed its synthesis to Glc3-Man9-GlcNAc2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The other 50 % remained <scope type="spec" id="3"> endo H-resistant and , accordingly , it <cue type="spec" id="3">should</cue> be derived from the precursor oligosaccharide Man5-GlcNAc2 synthesized by this mutant</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A closer analysis of forms that have received two oligosaccharides ( ExgIb ) showed that the first sequon was enriched in truncated residues , whereas the second one was enriched in regular counterparts .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Similarly , analysis of the individual underglycosylated glycoforms <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicated that</cue> 38 % of the oligosaccharides attached to the second site were regular</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This percentage dropped to 20 % for glycoforms carrying the oligosaccharide in the first sequon .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="5"> The preferential transfer of truncated oligosaccharides to the first glycosylation site <cue type="spec" id="5">seems</cue> to be a consequence of ( 1 ) the low percentage of truncated lipid linked oligosaccharides that receives the glucotriose unit , and ( 2 ) the effect of the glucotriose unit on the selection of N-sites to be glycosylated</scope> .</sentence>
