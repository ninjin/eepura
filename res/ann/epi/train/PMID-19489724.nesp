<sentence id="0">Regulation and cellular roles of ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinating enzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) are proteases that process ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like gene products , reverse the modification of proteins by a single ubiquitin(-like) protein , and remodel polyubiquitin(-like) chains on target proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The human genome encodes nearly 100 DUBs with specificity for ubiquitin in five gene families .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Most DUB activity is cryptic , and conformational rearrangements often occur during the binding of ubiquitin and/or scaffold proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">DUBs with specificity for ubiquitin contain insertions and extensions modulating DUB substrate specificity , protein-protein interactions , and cellular localization .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Binding partners and multiprotein complexes with which DUBs associate modulate DUB activity and substrate specificity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Quantitative studies of activity and protein-protein interactions , together with genetic studies and the advent of RNAi , have led to new insights into the function of yeast and human DUBs .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This review discusses ubiquitin-specific DUBs , some of the generalizations emerging from recent studies of the regulation of DUB activity , and their roles in various cellular processes .</sentence>
