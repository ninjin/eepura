<sentence id="0">The effect of aspartate hydroxylation on calcium binding to epidermal growth factor-like modules in coagulation factors IX and X.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hydroxylation of aspartic acid to erythro-beta-aspartic acid ( Hya ) occurs in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules in numerous extracellular proteins with diverse functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several EGF-like modules with the consensus sequence for hydroxylation bind Ca2+ , and it has therefore been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that the hydroxyl group is essential for Ca2+ binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine directly the influence of beta-hydroxylation on calcium binding in the EGF-like modules from coagulation factors IX and X , we have now measured calcium binding to both the fully beta-hydroxylated and the non-beta-hydroxylated modules of the two proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">At low ionic strength , the Hya-containing module of factor X has a slightly higher Ca2+ affinity , but at physiological salt concentrations <scope type="neg" id="1">this difference is <cue type="neg" id="1">no longer</cue> significant for either factor IX or X. Analysis of the 1H NMR chemical shift differences between the hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated factor X modules show that hydroxylation has <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect on the domain fold</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , measurements on factor IX show that hydroxylation has <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> effect on the Ca2+/Mg2+ specificity of the ion binding site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We conclude that the hydroxyl group is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> a direct ligand for the calcium ion in these EGF-like modules , <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">nor</cue> is it essential for high-affinity Ca2+ binding</scope></scope> .</sentence>
