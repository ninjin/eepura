<sentence id="0">Cell shape regulates global histone acetylation in human mammary epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) regulates cell morphology and gene expression in vivo ; these relationships are maintained in three-dimensional ( 3D ) cultures of mammary epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the presence of laminin-rich ECM ( lrECM ) , mammary epithelial cells round up and undergo global histone deacetylation , a process critical for their functional differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , it remains <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> lrECM-dependent cell rounding and global histone deacetylation are indeed part of a common physical-biochemical pathway</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using 3D cultures as well as nonadhesive and micropatterned substrata , here we showed that the cell ' rounding ' caused by lrECM was sufficient to induce deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of biochemical cues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Microarray and confocal analysis demonstrated that this deacetylation in 3D culture is associated with a global increase in chromatin condensation and a reduction in gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Whereas cells cultured on plastic substrata formed prominent stress fibers , cells grown in 3D lrECM or on micropatterns <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lacked</cue> these structures</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D phenocopied the lrECM-induced cell rounding and histone deacetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results reveal a novel link between ECM-controlled cell shape and chromatin structure and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that this link is mediated by changes in the actin cytoskeleton</scope> .</sentence>
