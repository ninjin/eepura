<sentence id="0">Epigenetic inheritance through self-recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Maintenance of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA- and histone-methylation is essential for preserving cellular identity and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Multiplication of eukaryotic cells requires that the DNA content of the cell is duplicated through replication , which is coupled to incorporation of de novo synthesized core histones into nucleosomal structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">One of the challenging questions in biology is to explain how the organism ensures that regulatory epigenetic marks , once established , are transferred from one cell generation to the next .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Based on studies in our laboratory , we have recently proposed a model for how the methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27 ) can be stably transmitted through the cell division cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , which is responsible for di- and trimethylation of H3K27 ( H3K27me2/me3 ) , binds to its own site of methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that maintenance of transcriptional repression by PRC2 requires the binding of the PRC2 complex to H3K27me3/me2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Based on these two key observations we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that PRC2 is able to copy the mark from an old parental H3 molecule to a newly synthesized H3 molecule as DNA replication proceeds</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , our results support a model for how the H3K27me3 mark could be preserved in the interphase of the cell cycle , where other events such as histone exchange and demethylation could counteract PRC2 function .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Here we discuss the implications of our results in further detail .</sentence>
