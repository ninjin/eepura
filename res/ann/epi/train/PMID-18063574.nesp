<sentence id="0">Kinetic rationale for selectivity toward N- and C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain substrates mediated by a loop region of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hydroxylation of two conserved prolyl residues in the N- and C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domains ( NODD and CODD ) of the alpha-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) signals for its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In human cells , three prolyl hydroxylases ( PHDs 1-3 ) belonging to the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenase family catalyze prolyl hydroxylation with differing selectivity for CODD and NODD .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Sequence analysis of the catalytic domains of the PHDs in the light of crystal structures for PHD2 , and results for other 2OG oxygenases , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that either the C-terminal region or a loop linking two beta-strands ( beta2 and beta3 in human PHD2 ) are important in determining substrate selectivity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Mutation analyses on PHD2 revealed that the beta2beta3 loop is a major determinant in conferring selectivity for CODD over NODD peptides .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A chimeric PHD in which the beta2beta3 loop of PHD2 was replaced with that of PHD3 displayed an almost complete selectivity for CODD ( in competition experiments ) , as observed for wild-type PHD3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CODD was observed to bind much more tightly to this chimeric protein than the wild type PHD2 catalytic domain .</sentence>
