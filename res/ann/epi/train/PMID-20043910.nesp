<sentence id="0">RKIP inhibits NF-kappaB in cancer cells by regulating upstream signaling components of the IkappaB kinase complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">RKIP was first identified as an inhibitor of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">RKIP was also found to play an important role in the NF-kappaB pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that RKIP functioned as a scaffold protein facilitating the phosphorylation of IkappaB by upstream kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , contrary to what one <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">would</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">expect</cue> of a scaffold protein</scope></scope> , our results show that RKIP has an overall inhibitory effect on the NF-kappaB transcriptional activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since NF-kappaB target gene expression is subject to negative regulation involving the optimal induction of negative regulators , our data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">support</cue> a <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesis</cue> that RKIP inhibits NF-kappaB activity via the auto-regulatory feedback loop by rapidly inducing the expression and synthesis of inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
