<sentence id="0">Distinct methylation pattern and microsatellite instability in sporadic gastric cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Aberrant 5' CpG island methylation is an alternative mechanism of gene inactivation during the development of cancer as demonstrated for several tumor-suppressor genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Also , marked relationship of microsatellite instability ( MSI ) and DNA methylation has been reported in sporadic colorectal cancer , which is a result of epigenetic inactivation of hMLH1 in association of promoter hypermethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study , we investigated the 5' CpG island hypermethylation of hMLH1 , E-cadherin and p16 in 61 primary gastric cancers ( GCs ) by using combined bisulfite restriction analysis ( COBRA ) and methylation-specific PCR ( MSP ) , and their MSI status .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Of 61 GCs investigated , 5 ( 8.1 % ) tumors presented hMLH1 methylation , 16 ( 26.2 % ) and 25 ( 40.9 % ) showed E-cadherin and p16 methylation respectively , and 8 ( 13.1 % ) presented high-frequency MSI ( MSI-H ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Of the 8 MSI-H patients , 5 presented hMLH1 methylation , whereas no low-frequency MSI ( MSI-L ) and microsatellite stable ( MSS ) cases exhibited hMLH1 methylation ( 5/8 vs. 0/43 , p < 0.00001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , these patients also presented E-cadherin and p16 hypermethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our data showed a significant correlation between hMLH1 methylation and MSI in GC , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that a common mechanism of aberrant de novo methylation can be postulated in these cancers</scope> .</sentence>
