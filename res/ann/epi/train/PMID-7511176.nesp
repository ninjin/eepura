<sentence id="0">Studies of the conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes of simian immunodeficiency virus envelope protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It has been shown previously that the major neutralizing epitopes in simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) are discontinuous and conformation dependent and that the V3 loop , in contrast to that of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) type 1 , does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> by itself elicit neutralizing antibodies ( K. Javaherian et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1418-1422 , 1992</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now present data showing that on the basis of fractionation of infected macaque sera , protease digestion of the envelope , and binding properties of two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to SIV and SIV-HIV chimeric envelope proteins , changes in V3 can disrupt the conformation-dependent neutralization region .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The chimeric protein did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> produce significant neutralizing antibodies against either SIV or HIV</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also report that neutralizing antibodies elicited by recombinant SIV envelope proteins of mac251 and B670 isolates cross-neutralize .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Finally , we show that deglycosylation of the SIV envelope results in a molecule which binds <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">neither</cue> soluble CD4 <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">nor</cue> the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies being investigated here</scope></scope> and does <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> elicit sera with a significant neutralizing titer</scope> .</sentence>
