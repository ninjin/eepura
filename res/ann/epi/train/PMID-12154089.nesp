<sentence id="0">Postsynthetic trimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 in mammalian tissues is associated with aging .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of the N-terminal region of histones was first described more than 35 years ago , but its biological significance has remained <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Proposed functions range from transcriptional regulation to the higher order packing of chromatin in progress of mitotic condensation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Primarily because of the recent discovery of the SET domain-depending H3-specific histone methyltransferases SUV39H1 and Suv39h1 , which selectively methylate lysine 9 of the H3 N terminus , this posttranslational modification has regained scientific interest .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the past , investigations concerning the biological significance of histone methylation were largely limited because of a <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of simple and sensitive analytical procedures for detecting this modification</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The present work investigated the methylation pattern of histone H4 both in different mammalian organs of various ages and in cell lines by applying mass spectrometric analysis and a newly developed hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatographic method enabling the simultaneous separation of methylated and acetylated forms , which obviates the need to work with radioactive materials .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In rat kidney and liver the dimethylated lysine 20 was found to be the main methylation product , whereas the monomethyl derivative was present in much smaller amounts .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , for the first time a trimethylated form of lysine 20 of H4 was found in mammalian tissue .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A significant increase in this trimethylated histone H4 was detected in organs of animals older than 30 days , whereas the amounts of mono- and dimethylated forms did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> essentially change in organs from young ( 10 days old ) or old animals ( 30 and 450 days old )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Trimethylated H4 was also detected in transformed cells ; although it was present in only trace amounts in logarithmically growing cells , we found an increase in trimethylated lysine 20 in cells in the stationary phase .</sentence>
