<sentence id="2">In this study , we identified signal recognition particle receptor beta subunit ( SRbeta ) , an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as a novel Pirh2-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We confirmed that Pirh2 interacted with SRbeta in mammalian cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">An immunofluorescent staining revealed that Pirh2 colocalized with SRbeta in the ER .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Pirh2 poly-ubiquitylated SRbeta in an intact RING finger domain-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Unexpectedly , different from other Pirh2 substrates , neither overexpression of Pirh2 nor depletion of cellular Pirh2 affected SRbeta protein stability .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pirh2 preferentially utilized lysine residues 6 and 29 of the ubiquitin to mediate the formation of polyubiquitin chains on SRbeta .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that Pirh2 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> regulate SRbeta function by mediating poly-ubiquitylation of SRbeta without affecting the stability of SRbeta protein per se</scope></scope> .</sentence>
