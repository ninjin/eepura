<sentence id="0">Ubiquitination of mammalian Pex5p , the peroxisomal import receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane requires the concerted action of numerous peroxins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One central component of this machinery is Pex5p , the cycling receptor for matrix proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pex5p recognizes newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol and promotes their translocation across the peroxisomal membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After this translocation step , Pex5p is recycled back into the cytosol to start a new protein transport cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we show that mammalian Pex5p is ubiquitinated at the peroxisomal membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Two different types of ubiquitination were detected , one of which is thiol-sensitive , involves Cys(11) of Pex5p , and is necessary for the export of the receptor back into the cytosol .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Together with mechanistic data recently described for yeast Pex5p , these findings provide strong evidence for the existence of Pex4p- and Pex22p-like proteins in mammals .</sentence>
