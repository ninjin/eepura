<sentence id="0">Hypoxia-induced assembly of prolyl hydroxylase PHD3 into complexes : implications for its activity and susceptibility for degradation by the E3 ligase Siah2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PHD1-3 ( prolyl hydroxylases 1-3 ) catalyse the hydroxylation of HIF ( hypoxia-inducible factor ) -alpha subunit that triggers the substrate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The RING ( really interesting new gene ) finger E3 ligase Siah2 preferentially targets PHD3 for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we identify the requirements for such selective targeting .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Firstly , PHD3 lacks an N-terminal extension found in PHD1 and PHD2 ; deletion of this domain from PHD1 and PHD2 renders them susceptible to degradation by Siah2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Secondly , PHD3 can homo- and hetero-multimerize with other PHDs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Consequently , PHD3 is found in high-molecular-mass fractions that were enriched in hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , within the lower-molecular-mass complex , PHD3 exhibits higher specific activity towards hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha and co-localizes with Siah2 , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that Siah2 limits the availability of the more active form of PHD3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings provide new insight into the mechanism underlying the regulation of PHD3 availability and activity in hypoxia by the E3 ligase Siah2 .</sentence>
