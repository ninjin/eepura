<sentence id="0">Degradation of FAT10 by the 26S proteasome is independent of ubiquitylation but relies on NUB1L .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome , a process accelerated by the UBL-UBA domain protein NEDD8 ultimate buster 1-long .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that FAT10-mediated degradation occurs independently of poly-ubiquitylation as purified 26S proteasome readily degraded FAT10-dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> ubiquitin-DHFR in vitro</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Interestingly , the 26S proteasome could only degrade FAT10-DHFR when NUB1L was present .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Knock-down of NUB1L attenuated the degradation of FAT10-DHFR in intact cells <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that NUB1L determines the degradation rate of FAT10-linked proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In conclusion , our data establish FAT10 as a ubiquitin-independent but NUB1L-dependent targeting signal for proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
