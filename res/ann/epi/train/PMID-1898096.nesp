<sentence id="0">gp160 of HIV-I synthesized by persistently infected Molt-3 cells is terminally glycosylated : evidence that cleavage of gp160 occurs subsequent to oligosaccharide processing .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The envelope glycoprotein of HIV-I in infected , cultured human T cells is synthesized as a precursor of apparent Mr 160 kDa ( gp160 ) and is cleaved to two glycoproteins , gp120 and gp41 , which are the mature envelope glycoproteins in the virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Neither the temporal and spatial features of glycosylation nor the oligosaccharide processing and proteolytic cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein are well understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To understand more about these events , we investigated the glycosylation and cleavage of the envelope glycoproteins in the CD4+ human cell line , Molt-3 , persistently infected with HIV-I ( HTLV IIIB ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The carbohydrate analysis of gp160 and gp120 and the behavior of the glycoproteins and glycopeptides derived from them on immobilized lectins demonstrate that both of these glycoproteins contain complex- and high-mannose-type Asn-linked oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , the N-glycanase-resistant oligosaccharides of gp120 were found to contain N-acetyl-galactosamine , a common constituent of Ser/Thr-linked oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Pulse-chase analysis of the conversion of [35S]cysteine-labeled gp160 showed that in Molt-3 cells it takes about 2 h for gp120 to arise with a half-time of conversion of about 5 h. At its earliest detectable occurrence , gp120 was found to contain complex-type Asn-linked oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> proteolytic cleavage of gp160 to gp120 and gp41 occurs either within the trans-Golgi or in a distal compartment</scope> .</sentence>
