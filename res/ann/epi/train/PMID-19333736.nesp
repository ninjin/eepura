<sentence id="1">The enormous repertoire of the vertebrate specific immune system relies on the rearrangement of discrete gene segments into intact antigen receptor genes during the early stages of B-and T-cell development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This V(D)J recombination is initiated by a lymphoid-specific recombinase comprising the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins , which introduces double-strand breaks in the DNA adjacent to the coding segments .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Much of the biochemical research into V(D)J recombination has focused on <scope type="spec" id="1"> truncated <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> " core " fragments of RAG1 and RAG2 , which <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> approximately one third of the amino acids from each</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , genetic analyses of SCID and Omenn syndrome patients <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> residues outside the cores are essential to normal immune development</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This is in agreement with the striking degree of conservation across all vertebrate classes in certain non-core domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Work from multiple laboratories has shed light on activities resident within these domains , including ubiquitin ligase activity and KPNA1 binding by the RING finger domain of RAG1 and the recognition of specific chromatin modifications as well as phosphoinositide binding by the PHD module of RAG2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , elements outside of the cores are necessary for regulated protein expression and turnover .</sentence>
