<sentence id="0">A family of Salmonella virulence factors functions as a distinct class of autoregulated E3 ubiquitin ligases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Processes as diverse as receptor binding and signaling , cytoskeletal dynamics , and programmed cell death are manipulated by mimics of host proteins encoded by pathogenic bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show here that the Salmonella virulence factor SspH2 belongs to a growing class of bacterial effector proteins that harness and subvert the eukaryotic ubiquitination pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This virulence protein possesses ubiquitination activity that depends on a conserved cysteine residue .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A crystal structure of SspH2 reveals a canonical leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain that interacts with a unique E3 ligase [ which we have termed NEL for Novel E3 Ligase ] C-terminal fold unrelated to previously observed HECT or RING-finger E3 ligases .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , the LRR domain sequesters the catalytic cysteine residue contained in the NEL domain , and we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> a mechanism for activation of the ligase requiring a substantial conformational change to release the catalytic domain for function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also show that the N-terminal domain targets SspH2 to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> a model whereby binding of the LRR to proteins at the target site releases the ligase domain for site-specific function</scope> .</sentence>
