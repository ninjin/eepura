<sentence id="0">Lipopolysaccharide-mediated interferon regulatory factor activation involves TBK1-IKKepsilon-dependent Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of TANK/I-TRAF .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Type I interferon gene induction relies on IKK-related kinase TBK1 and IKKepsilon-mediated phosphorylations of IRF3/7 through the Toll-like receptor-dependent signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The scaffold proteins that assemble these kinase complexes are poorly characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show here that TANK/ITRAF is required for the TBK1- and IKKepsilon-mediated IRF3/7 phosphorylations through some Toll-like receptor-dependent pathways and is part of a TRAF3-containing complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , TANK is dispensable for the early phase of double-stranded RNA-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , TANK is heavily phosphorylated by TBK1-IKKepsilon upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation and is also subject to lipopolysaccharide- and TBK1-IKKepsilon-mediated Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination , a mechanism that does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> require TBK1-IKKepsilon kinase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , we have identified TANK as a scaffold protein that assembles some but not all IRF3/7-phosphorylating TBK1-IKKepsilon complexes and demonstrated that these kinases possess two functions , namely the phosphorylation of both IRF3/7 and TANK as well as the recruitment of an E3 ligase for Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination of their scaffold protein , TANK .</sentence>
