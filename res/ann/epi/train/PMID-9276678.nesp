<sentence id="0">Glycosylation of human bone collagen I in relation to lysylhydroxylation and fibril diameter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Posttranslational modifications ( lysylhydroxylation , glycosylation , and crosslink formation ) of collagen I and the trabecular bone volume ( TBV ) as well as the supramolecular organization of human vertebrae were studied by analyzing vertebral bones of 55 individuals ( 22-93 years of age ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The degree of lysylhydroxylation of both a-chains of collagen I showed a significant inverse correlation with the TBV , while only a weak correlation between lysylhydroxylation of alpha2(I) and the age of the donor was observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The degree of glycosylation of collagen I was significantly correlated with both the level of lysylhydroxylation and the degree of osteopenia .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Electron microscopic evaluation did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> show any relationship between the level of collagen glycosylation and the diameter of in vivo formed fibrils or in vitro formed fibrillar aggregates</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In our study the molar ratio of the mature collagen crosslinks , pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline , showed a slight tendency to be higher , in particular in the samples with a high level of lysylhydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This ratio was recently found to be significantly increased in avian osteoporotic bone .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the increased level of lysylhydroxylation in human osteopenia is related to the glycosylation of collagen I , while <scope type="spec" id="2"> it <cue type="spec" id="2">seems</cue> to have little impact on the formation of the mature , non-reducible collagen crosslinks investigated</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Based on our observations it appears <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">unlikely</cue> that the different diameters of collagen fibrils contribute greatly to the reduced biomechanical stability reported for overhydroxylated , osteopenic bone tissue</scope> .</sentence>
