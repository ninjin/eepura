<sentence id="0">CSF-1 and TPA stimulate independent pathways leading to lysosomal degradation or regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the CSF-1 receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The CSF-1 receptor is a protein-tyrosine kinase that has been shown to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis , or RIPping .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we have compared receptor downregulation and RIPping in response to CSF-1 and TPA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our studies show that CSF-1 is a relatively poor inducer of RIPping and that CSF-1-induced receptor downregulation is largely independent of RIPping .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TPA is a strong inducer of RIPping and TPA-induced receptor downregulation is mediated by RIPping .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We further found that RIPping is dependent on TACE or a TACE-like protease , that CSF-1 and TPA use independent pathways to initiate RIPping , and that the intracellular domain is targeted for degradation through ubiquitination .</sentence>
