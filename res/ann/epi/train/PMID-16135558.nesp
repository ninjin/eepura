<sentence id="0">ST6GalNAc I expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells greatly modifies their O-glycosylation pattern and enhances their tumourigenicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Sialyl-Tn is a carbohydrate antigen overexpressed in several epithelial cancers , including breast cancer , and usually associated with poor prognosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Sialyl-Tn is synthesized by a CMP-Neu5Ac:GalNAcalpha2,6-sialyltransferase : CMP-Neu5Ac : R-GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr alpha2,6-sialyltransferase ( EC 2.4.99.3 ) ( ST6GalNAc I ) , which transfers a sialic acid residue in alpha2,6-linkage to the GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr structure .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , established breast cancer cell lines express neither ST6GalNAc I nor sialyl-Tn .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have previously shown that stable transfection of MDA-MB-231 , a human breast cancer cell line , with ST6GalNAc I cDNA induces sialyl-Tn antigen ( STn ) expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We report here the modifications of the O-glycosylation pattern of a MUC1-related recombinant protein secreted by MDA-MB-231 sialyl-Tn positive cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also show that sialyl-Tn expression and concomitant changes in the overall O-glycan profiles induce a decrease of adhesion and an increase of migration of MDA-MB-231 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , STn positive clones exhibit an increased tumour growth in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These observations <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that modification of the O-glycosylation pattern induced by ST6GalNAc I expression are sufficient to enhance the tumourigenicity of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells</scope> .</sentence>
