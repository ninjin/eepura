<sentence id="0">Assembly and structural characterization of an authentic complex between human follicle stimulating hormone and a hormone-binding ectodomain of its receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) is secreted from the pituitary gland to regulate reproduction in vertebrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">FSH signals through a G-protein coupled receptor ( FSHR ) on the target cell surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We describe here the strategy to produce a soluble FSH-FSHR complex that involves the co-secretion of a truncated FSHR ectodomain ( FSHR(HB) ) and a covalently linked FSHalphabeta heterodimer from baculovirus-infected insect cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">FSH binds to FSHR(HB) with a high affinity comparable to that for the full-length receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The crystal structure of the FSH-FSHR(HB) complex provides explanations for the high affinity and specificity of FSH interaction with FSHR , and it shows an unexpected dimerization of these complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Here we also compare the crystal structure with theoretical models of the FSH-FSHR-binding mode .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that the FSH-FSHR(HB) structure gives an authentic representation of FSH binding to intact FSHR .</sentence>
