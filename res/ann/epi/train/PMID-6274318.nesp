<sentence id="0">Regulation of collagen post-translational modification in transformed human and chick-embryo cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Changes in the regulation of collagen post-translational modification in transformed cells were studied in three established human sarcoma cell lines and in chick-embryo fibroblasts freshly transformed by Rous sarcoma virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The collagens synthesized by all but one of these and by all the control human and chick-embryo cell lines were almost exclusively of types I and/or III .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The relative rate of collagen synthesis and the amounts of prolyl hydroxylase activity and immunoreactive protein were markedly low in all the transformed human cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The other enzymes studied , lysyl hydroxylase , hydroxylysyl galactosyltransferase and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase , never showed as large a decrease in activity as did prolyl hydroxylase , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> a more efficient regulation of the last enzyme than of the three others</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The chick-embryo fibroblasts freshly transformed by Rous sarcoma virus differed from the human sarcoma cells in that prolyl hydroxylase activity was distinctly increased , whereas the decreases in immunoreactive prolyl hydroxylase protein and the three other enzyme activities were very similar to those in the simian-virus-40-transformed human fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">seems</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> that this increased prolyl hydroxylase activity is only a temporary phenomenon occurring shortly after the transformation</scope></scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be followed by a decrease in activity later</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The newly synthesized collagens of all the transformed cells that produced almost exclusively collagen types I and/or III had high extents of lysyl hydroxylation , and there was also an increase in the ratio of glycosylated to non-glycosylated hydroxylysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that one critical factor affecting modification is the rate of collagen synthesis , which affects the ratio of enzyme to substrate in the cell</scope> .</sentence>
