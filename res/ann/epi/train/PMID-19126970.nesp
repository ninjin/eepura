<sentence id="0">Glycosylation of serum proteins in inflammatory diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inflammatory diseases are accompanied by numerous changes at the site of inflammation as well as many systemic physiological and biochemical changes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the past two decades more and more attention is being paid to changes in glycosylation and in this review we describe some of the changes found on main serum proteins ( alpha1-acid glycoprotein , immunoglobulin G , immunoglobulin A , transferrin , haptoglobin , alpha2-macroglobulin , C-reactive protein , and others ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Molecular background and physiological importance of most of these changes are yet to be discovered , but it is evident that glycosylation plays an important role in the inflammatory response .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Maybe the greatest value of these changes currently lays in their potential diagnostic and prognostic usage , either in combination with current diagnostic markers or on their own .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , determining glycan structures is still technically too complex for most clinical laboratories and further efforts have to be made to develop simple analytical tools to study changes in glycosylation .</sentence>
