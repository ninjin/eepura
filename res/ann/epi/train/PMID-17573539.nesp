<sentence id="0">Mutations in the Type II protein arginine methyltransferase AtPRMT5 result in pleiotropic developmental defects in Arabidopsis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human PROTEIN ARGININE METHYLTRANSFERASE5 ( PRMT5 ) encodes a type II protein arginine ( Arg ) methyltransferase and its homologs in animals and yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) are known to regulate RNA processing , signal transduction , and gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , PRMT5 homologs in higher plants have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> yet been reported</scope> and the biological roles of these proteins in plant development remain elusive .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , using conventional biochemical approaches , we purified a plant histone Arg methyltransferase from cauliflower ( Brassica oleracea ) that was nearly identical to AtPRMT5 , an Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) homolog of human PRMT5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">AtPRMT5 methylated histone H4 , H2A , and myelin basic protein in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Western blot using symmetric dimethyl histone H4 Arg 3-specific antibody and thin-layer chromatography analysis demonstrated that AtPRMT5 is a type II enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mutations in AtPRMT5 caused pleiotropic developmental defects , including growth retardation , dark green and curled leaves , and FlOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)-dependent delayed flowering .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore , the type II protein Arg methyltransferase AtPRMT5 is involved in promotion of vegetative growth and FLC-dependent flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis .</sentence>
