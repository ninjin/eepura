<sentence id="0">The E3 Ligase MuRF1 degrades myosin heavy chain protein in dexamethasone-treated skeletal muscle .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a side effect of treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone ( DEX ) and is a hallmark of cachectic syndromes associated with increased cortisol levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 ( muscle RING finger protein 1 ) is transcriptionally upregulated by DEX treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Differentiated myotubes treated with DEX undergo depletion of myosin heavy chain protein ( MYH ) , which physically associates with MuRF1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This loss of MYH can be blocked by inhibition of MuRF1 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When wild-type and MuRF1(-/-) mice are treated with DEX , the MuRF1(-/-) animals exhibit a relative sparing of MYH .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In vitro , MuRF1 is shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for MYH .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data identify the mechanism by which MYH is depleted under atrophy conditions and demonstrate that inhibition of a single E3 ligase , MuRF1 , is sufficient to maintain this important sarcomeric protein .</sentence>
