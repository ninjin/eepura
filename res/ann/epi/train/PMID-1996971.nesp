<sentence id="0">Dynamically acetylated histones of chicken erythrocytes are selectively methylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The relationship between histone acetylation and methylation in chicken immature erythrocytes was investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies have shown that transcriptionally active/competent gene-enriched chromatin fragments are enriched in newly methylated histones H3 and H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , newly methylated histone H4 is hyperacetylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we show that dynamically acetylated histone H4 is selectively engaged in ongoing methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While sodium butyrate ( an inhibitor of histone deacetylase ) does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> inhibit ongoing histone methylation</scope> , it does affect the acetylation state of newly methylated histone H4 when chicken immature erythrocytes are incubated in its presence or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Only one rate of acetylation of labelled newly methylated unacetylated histone H4 with a t1/2 of 8 min is observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Previous studies have shown that the solubility of transcriptionally active/competent gene chromatin fragments in 0.15 M-NaCl is dependent upon the level of acetylated histone species , with induction of hyperacetylation increasing the solubility of this gene chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Here , we show that the low salt solubility of chromatin fragments associated with newly methylated histones H3 and H4 is also dependent upon the level of acetylated histones .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results provide further support for the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesis</cue> that histones participating in ongoing methylation are associated with transcriptionally active/competent chromatin and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the processes of histone H4 methylation and dynamic acetylation are partially coupled in terminally differentiated erythrocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
