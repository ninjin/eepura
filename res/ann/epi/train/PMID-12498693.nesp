<sentence id="0">Gene-specific targeting of H3K9 methylation is sufficient for initiating repression in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Covalent modifications of chromatin have emerged as key determinants of the genome 's transcriptional competence .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9 ) methylation is an epigenetic signal that is recognized by HP1 and correlates with gene silencing in a variety of organisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">Discovery</cue> of the enzymes that catalyze H3K9 methylation</scope> has identified a second gene-specific function for this modification in transcriptional repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Whether H3K9 methylation is causative in the initiation and establishment of gene repression <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue></scope> is a byproduct of the process leading to the repressed state remains <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To investigate the role of HMTs and specifically H3K9 methylation in gene repression , we have employed engineered zinc-finger transcription factors ( ZFPs ) to target HMT activity to a specific endogenous gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By utilizing ZFPs that recognize the promoter of the endogenous VEGF-A gene , and thus employing this chromosomal locus as an in vivo reporter , we show that ZFPs linked to a minimal catalytic HMT domain affect local methylation of histone H3K9 and the consequent repression of target gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , amino acid substitutions within the HMT that ablate its catalytic activity effectively eliminate the ability of the ZFP fusions to repress transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , H3K9 methylation is a primary signal that is sufficient for initiating a gene repression pathway in vivo .</sentence>
