<sentence id="0">IKKalpha negatively regulates IRF-5 function in a MyD88-TRAF6 pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription factors of IRF family , IRF-3 , IRF-5 and IRF-7 play a critical role in the innate antiviral response .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In infected cells , IRF-3 and IRF-7 are activated by TBK-1 and IKK epsilon mediated phosphorylation , while the kinase , phosphorylating IRF-5 in the MyD88 signalling pathway has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> yet been identified</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We now show that IKK alpha phosphorylates IRF-5 and induces formation of IRF-5 dimers , which have been indicative of IRF-5 activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , IKK alpha induced IRF-5 phosphorylation exerts inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activation of type 1 interferon and promoters of the inflammatory cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Addressing the molecular mechanism of IKK alpha mediated inhibition of IRF-5 activity , we show that phosphorylation of IRF-5 by IKK alpha inhibits K63 ubiquitination that is essential for IRF-5 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we have identified interaction of IRF-5 with alkaline phosphatase , which causes its de-phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The observation that MyD88 activated IRF-5 induces expression of alkaline phosphatase <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that IRF-5 is under autoregulating loop</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus these completely new observations identify IKK alpha kinase and alkaline phosphatase as negative regulators of IRF-5 activity in MyD88 pathway and implicate their role in the control of the inflammatory response by attenuation of IRF-5 activity .</sentence>
