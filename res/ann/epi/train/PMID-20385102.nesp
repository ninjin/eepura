<sentence id="0">Molting-specific downregulation of C. elegans body-wall muscle attachment sites : the role of RNF-5 E3 ligase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Repeated molting of the cuticula is an integral part of arthropod and nematode development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Shedding of the old cuticle takes place on the surface of hypodermal cells , which are also responsible for secretion and synthesis of a new cuticle .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we use the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to show that muscle cells , laying beneath and mechanically linked to the hypodermis , play an important role during molting .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We followed the molecular composition and distribution of integrin mediated adhesion structures called dense bodies ( DB ) , which indirectly connect muscles to the hypodermis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found the concentration of two DB proteins ( PAT-3/beta-integrin and UNC-95 ) to decrease during the quiescent phase of molting , concomitant with an apparent increase in lateral movement of the DB .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that levels of the E3-ligase RNF-5 increase specifically during molting , and that RNF-5 acts to ubiquitinate the DB protein UNC-95 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Persistent high levels of RNF-5 driven by a heatshock or unc-95 promoter lead to <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failure</cue> of ecdysis</scope> , and in non-molting worms to a progressive detachment of the cuticle from the hypodermis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These observations <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> increased DB dynamics characterizes the lethargus phase of molting in parallel to decreased levels of DB components and that temporal expression of RNF-5 contributes to an efficient molting process</scope> .</sentence>
