<sentence id="0">Targeted deletion of the Nesp55 DMR defines another Gnas imprinting control region and provides a mouse model of autosomal dominant PHP-Ib .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Approximately 100 genes undergo genomic imprinting .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Mutations in fewer than 10 imprinted genetic loci , including GNAS , are associated with complex human diseases that differ phenotypically based on the parent transmitting the mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Besides the ubiquitously expressed Gsalpha , which is of broad biological importance , GNAS gives rise to an antisense transcript and to several Gsalpha variants that are transcribed from the nonmethylated parental allele .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We previously identified two almost identical GNAS microdeletions extending from exon NESP55 to antisense ( AS ) exon 3 ( delNESP55/delAS3-4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When inherited maternally , both deletions are associated with erasure of all maternal GNAS methylation imprints and autosomal-dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib , a disorder characterized by parathyroid hormone-resistant hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As for other imprinting disorders , the mechanisms resulting in abnormal GNAS methylation are largely unknown , in part because of a paucity of suitable animal models .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We now showed in mice that deletion of the region equivalent to delNESP55/delAS3-4 on the paternal allele ( DeltaNesp55(p) ) leads to healthy animals without Gnas methylation changes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , mice carrying the deletion on the maternal allele ( DeltaNesp55(m) ) showed loss of all maternal Gnas methylation imprints , leading in kidney to increased 1A transcription and decreased Gsalpha mRNA levels , and to associated hypocalcemia , hyperphosphatemia , and secondary hyperparathyroidism .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Besides representing a murine autosomal-dominant pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib model and one of only few animal models for imprinted human disorders , our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that the Nesp55 differentially methylated region is an additional principal imprinting control region , which directs Gnas methylation and thereby affects expression of all maternal Gnas-derived transcripts</scope> .</sentence>
