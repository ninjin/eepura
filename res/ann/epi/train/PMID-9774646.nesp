<sentence id="0">Persistent interactions of core histone tails with nucleosomal DNA following acetylation and transcription factor binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this study , we examined the effect of acetylation of the NH2 tails of core histones on their binding to nucleosomal DNA in the absence or presence of bound transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To do this , we used a novel UV laser-induced protein-DNA cross-linking technique , combined with immunochemical and molecular biology approaches .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Nucleosomes containing one or five GAL4 binding sites were reconstituted with hypoacetylated or hyperacetylated core histones .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Within these reconstituted particles , UV laser-induced histone-DNA cross-linking was found to occur only via the nonstructured histone tails and thus presented a unique tool for studying histone tail interactions with nucleosomal DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Importantly , these studies demonstrated that <scope type="neg" id="0">the NH2 tails were <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> released from nucleosomal DNA upon histone acetylation</scope> , although some weakening of their interactions was observed at elevated ionic strengths .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , the binding of up to five GAL4-AH dimers to nucleosomes occupying the central 90 bp occurred <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> displacement of the histone NH2 tails from DNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">GAL4-AH binding perturbed the interaction of each histone tail with nucleosomal DNA to different degrees .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , in all cases , greater than 50 % of the interactions between the histone tails and DNA was retained upon GAL4-AH binding , even if the tails were highly acetylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data illustrate an interaction of acetylated or nonacetylated histone tails with DNA that persists in the presence of simultaneously bound transcription factors .</sentence>
