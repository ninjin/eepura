<sentence id="0">Inhibition of p97-dependent protein degradation by Eeyarestatin I.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) by ER-associated degradation involves substrate retrotranslocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">For many substrates , retrotranslocation requires the action of ubiquitinating enzymes , which polyubiquitinate substrates emerging from the ER lumen , and of the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 ATPase complex , which hydrolyzes ATP to dislocate polyubiquitinated substrates into the cytosol .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Polypeptides extracted by p97 are eventually transferred to the proteasome for destruction .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In mammalian cells , ERAD can be blocked by <scope type="spec" id="0"> a chemical inhibitor termed Eeyarestatin I , but the mechanism of EerI action is <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we report that EerI can associate with a p97 complex to inhibit ERAD .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The interaction of EerI with the p97 complex <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to negatively influence a deubiquitinating process that is mediated by p97-associated deubiquitinating enzymes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We further show that ataxin-3 , a p97-associated deubiquitinating enzyme previously implicated in ER-associated degradation , is among those affected .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Interestingly , p97-associated deubiquitination is also involved in degradation of a soluble substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our analyses establish a role for a novel deubiquitinating process in proteasome-dependent protein turnover .</sentence>
