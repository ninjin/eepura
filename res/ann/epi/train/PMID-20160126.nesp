<sentence id="0">Distinct alterations in chromatin organization of the two IGF-I promoters precede growth hormone-induced activation of IGF-I gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Many of the physiological actions of GH are mediated by IGF-I , a secreted 70-residue peptide whose gene expression is induced by GH in the liver and other tissues via mechanisms that remain incompletely characterized but depend on the transcription factor Stat5b .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we investigate the chromatin landscape of the IGF-I gene in the liver of pituitary-deficient young adult male rats and assess the impact of a single systemic GH injection .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Despite minimal ongoing transcription in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of GH</scope> , both IGF-I promoters <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to reside in open chromatin environments , at least as inferred from relatively high levels of acetylation of core histones H3 and H4 when compared with adjacent intergenic DNA and from enhanced trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This landscape of open chromatin <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> reflect maturation of the liver</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Surprisingly , in the <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of hormone</scope> , IGF-I promoter 1 appears poised to be activated , as evidenced by the presence of the transcriptional coactivator p300 and recruitment of RNA polymerase ( Pol ) II into a preinitiation complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By contrast , chromatin surrounding IGF-I promoter 2 is devoid of both p300 and RNA Pol II .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Systemic GH treatment causes an approximately 15-fold increase in transcription from each IGF-I promoter within 60 min of hormone administration , leading to a sustained accumulation of IGF-I mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The coordinated induction of both IGF-I promoters by GH is accompanied by hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in promoter-associated chromatin , a decline in monomethylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 , and recruitment of RNA Pol II to IGF-I promoter 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We conclude that GH actions induce rapid and dramatic changes in hepatic chromatin at the IGF-I locus and activate IGF-I gene transcription in the liver by distinct promoter-specific mechanisms : at promoter 1 , GH causes RNA Pol II to be released from a previously recruited paused preinitiation complex , whereas at promoter 2 , hormone treatment facilitates recruitment and then activation of RNA Pol II to initiate transcription .</sentence>
