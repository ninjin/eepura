<sentence id="0">Expression and purification of functionally active hyaluronan-binding domains from human cartilage link protein , aggrecan and versican : formation of ternary complexes with defined hyaluronan oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan aggrecan forms link protein-stabilized complexes with hyaluronan ( HA ) , via its N-terminal G1-domain , that provide cartilage with its load bearing properties .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Similar aggregates ( <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> containing new members of the link protein family</scope> ) , in which other chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( i.e. versican , brevican , and neurocan ) substitute for aggrecan , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> contribute to the structural integrity of many other tissues including skin and brain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , cartilage link protein ( cLP ) and the G1-domains of aggrecan ( AG1 ) and versican ( VG1 ) were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The recombinant human proteins were found to have properties similar to those described for the native molecules ( e.g. cLP was able to form oligomers , and HA decasaccharides were the minimum size that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> compete effectively for their binding to polymeric HA )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Gel filtration and protein cross-linking/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight peptide fingerprinting showed that cLP and AG1 interact in the absence or presence of HA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conversely , cLP and VG1 did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> bind directly to each other in solution yet formed ternary complexes with HA24</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">N-linked glycosylation of AG1 and VG1 was demonstrated to be unnecessary for either HA binding or the formation of ternary complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Surprisingly , the length of HA required to accommodate two G1-domains was found to be significantly larger for aggrecan than versican , which <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> reflect differences in the conformation of HA stabilized on binding these proteins</scope> .</sentence>
