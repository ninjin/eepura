<sentence id="0">HIF prolyl-hydroxylase 2 is the key oxygen sensor setting low steady-state levels of HIF-1alpha in normoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) , a transcriptional complex conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to vertebrates , plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen availability .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In normoxia , the HIF-alpha subunits are targeted for destruction by prolyl hydroxylation , a specific modification that provides recognition for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein ( pVHL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Three HIF prolyl-hydroxylases ( PHD1 , 2 and 3 ) were identified recently in mammals and shown to hydroxylate HIF-alpha subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that specific ' silencing ' of PHD2 with short interfering RNAs is sufficient to stabilize and activate HIF-1alpha in normoxia in all the human cells investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">' Silencing ' of PHD1 and PHD3 has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on the stability of HIF-1alpha either in normoxia or upon re-oxygenation of cells briefly exposed to hypoxia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We therefore conclude that , in vivo , PHDs have distinct assigned functions , PHD2 being the critical oxygen sensor setting the low steady-state levels of HIF-1alpha in normoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , PHD2 is upregulated by hypoxia , providing an HIF-1-dependent auto-regulatory mechanism driven by the oxygen tension .</sentence>
