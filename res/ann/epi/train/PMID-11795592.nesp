<sentence id="0">Regulation of HIF by the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor : implications for cellular oxygen sensing .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is central in coordinating many of the transcriptional adaptations to hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Composed of a heterodimer of alpha and beta subunits , the alpha subunit is rapidly degraded in normoxia , leading to inactivation of the hypoxic response .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Many models for a molecular oxygen sensor regulating this system have been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">proposed</cue> , but an important finding has been the ability to mimic hypoxia by chelation or substitution of iron</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A key insight has been the recognition that HIF-alpha is targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through binding to the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein ( pVHL ) , which forms the recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex leading to ubiquitylation of HIF-alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Importantly , the classical features of regulation by iron and oxygen availability are reflected in regulation of the HIF-alpha/pVHL interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It has recently been shown that HIF-alpha undergoes an iron- and oxygen-dependent modification before it can interact with pVHL , and that this results in hydroxylation of at least one prolyl residue ( HIF-1alpha , Pro 564 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This modification is catalysed by an enzyme termed HIF-prolyl hydroxylase ( HIF-PH ) , and compatible with all previously described prolyl-4-hydroxylases HIF-PH also requires 2-oxoglutarate as a cosubstrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The key position of this hydroxylation in the degradation pathway of HIF-alpha , together with its requirement for molecular dioxygen as a co-substrate , provides the potential for HIF-PH to function directly as a cellular oxygen sensor .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , the ability of these enzyme(s) to account for the full range of physiological regulation displayed by the HIF system remains to be defined .</sentence>
