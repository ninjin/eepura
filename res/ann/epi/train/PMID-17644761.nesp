<sentence id="0">Analysis of dynamic changes in post-translational modifications of human histones during cell cycle by mass spectrometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The N-terminal tails of the four core histones are subject to several types of covalent post-translational modifications that have specific roles in regulating chromatin structure and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we present an extensive analysis of the core histone modifications occurring through the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our MS experiments characterized the modification patterns of histones from HeLa cells arrested in phase G1 , S , and G2/M .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For all core histones , the modifications in the G1 and S phases were largely identical but drastically different during mitosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Modification changes between S and G2/M phases were quantified using the SILAC ( stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture ) approach .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Most striking was the mitotic phosphorylation on histone H3 and H4 , whereas phosphorylation on H2A was constant during the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A loss of acetylation was observed on all histones in G2/M-arrested cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The pattern of cycle-dependent methylation was more complex : during G2/M , H3 Lys27 and Lys36 were decreased , whereas H4 Lys20 was increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results show that mitosis was the period of the cell cycle during which many modifications exhibit dynamic changes .</sentence>
