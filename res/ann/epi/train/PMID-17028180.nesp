<sentence id="0">Transcriptional regulation by Foxp3 is associated with direct promoter occupancy and modulation of histone acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulatory T cells ( T(reg) ) express Foxp3 , a forkhead family member that is necessary and sufficient for T(reg) lineage choice and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in non-T(reg) leads to repression of the interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) and interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) genes , gain of suppressor function , and induction of genes such as CD25 , GITR , and CTLA-4 , but the mode by which Foxp3 enforces this program is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using chromatin immunoprecipitation , we have demonstrated that Foxp3 binds to the endogenous IL-2 and IFNgamma loci in T cells , but only after T cell receptor stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This activation-induced Foxp3 binding was abrogated by cyclosporin A , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> a role for the phosphatase calcineurin in Foxp3 function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have also shown that binding of Foxp3 to the IL-2 and IFNgamma genes induces active deacetylation of histone H3 , a process that inhibits chromatin remodeling and opposes gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conversely , binding of Foxp3 to the GITR , CD25 , and CTLA-4 genes results in increased histone acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> Foxp3 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> regulate transcription through direct chromatin remodeling</scope></scope> and show that Foxp3 function is influenced by signals from the TCR .</sentence>
