<sentence id="0">JFK , a Kelch domain-containing F-box protein , links the SCF complex to p53 regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The p53 tumor suppressor plays a central role in integrating cellular responses to various stresses .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tight regulation of p53 is thus essential for the maintenance of genome integrity and normal cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Currently , several ubiquitin ligases , including the single-subunit RING-finger types--MDM2 , Pirh2 , and COP1--and the HECT-domain type--ARF-BP1--have been reported to target p53 for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report the identification of a human Kelch domain-containing F-box protein , JFK .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We showed that JFK promotes ubiquitination and degradation of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">But unlike MDM2 , Pirh2 , COP1 , and ARF-BP1 , all of which possess an intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity , JFK destabilizes p53 through the assembly of a Skp1-Cul1-F-box complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Significantly , JFK inhibits p53-dependent transcription , and depletion of JFK stabilizes p53 , promotes cell apoptosis , arrests cells in the G(1) phase , and sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation-induced cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> JFK is a critical negative regulator of p53 and represents a pathway for the maintenance of p53 levels in unstressed cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our experiments link the Skp1-Cul1-F-box system to p53 regulation .</sentence>
