<sentence id="1">There is a gap between the initial formation of cells carrying radiation-induced genetic damage and their contribution to cancer development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Herein , we reveal a previously uncharacterized gene FATS through a genome-wide approach and demonstrate its essential role in regulating the abundance of p21 in surveillance of genome integrity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A large exon coding the NH2-terminal domain of FATS , deleted in spontaneous mouse lymphomas , is much more frequently deleted in radiation-induced mouse lymphomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Its human counterpart is a fragile site gene at a previously identified loss of heterozygosity site .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">FATS is essential for maintaining steady-state level of p21 protein and sustaining DNA damage checkpoint .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the NH2-terminal FATS physically interacts with histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1 ) to enhance the acetylation of endogenous p21 , leading to the stabilization of p21 .</sentence>
