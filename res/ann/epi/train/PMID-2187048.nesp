<sentence id="0">Gonadotrophin glycosylation and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">This review emphasizes the heterogeneous structure of the gonadotrophin hormones and the influence of different oligosaccharide structures on the bioactivity of these hormones .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A summary has been made of the changes in biopotency of the gonadotrophins throughout the life-cycle of the human and in different endocrine states in the rat .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In general it <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> that the charge of the gonadotrophin conferred by the acid radicals attached to the terminal groups on the oligosaccharide structures strongly influences biopotency</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Basic structures have a greater potency in in-vitro assays , but a short half-life in the circulation , while acidic isoforms are less potent , but have a longer circulatory time and are thus more active in in-vivo estimations .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">More basic forms are secreted over the adult reproductive years compared with the prepubertal period and old age .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The glycosyl structure of the carbohydrate groups also alters in different endocrine states and is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">probably</cue> also important for the bioactivity and potency of the hormone</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) and gonadal steroids can influence the type of isoform synthesized and released , and therefore affect the function of gonadotrophins .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">GnRH enhances glycosylation , sulphation and biopotency .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Oestradiol potentiates the glycosylation induced by GnRH and reduces sialylation , while testosterone increases sialylation .</sentence>
