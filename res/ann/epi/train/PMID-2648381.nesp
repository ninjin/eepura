<sentence id="0">Purification and analysis of RNA polymerase II transcription factors by using wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We recently found that many RNA polymerase II transcription factors are modified with N-acetylglucosamine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These sugar moieties confer upon transcription factors an ability to bind the lectin wheat germ agglutinin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have taken advantage of this interaction to devise a purification procedure for the " GC-box " binding transcription factor Sp1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Crude nuclear extracts are first subjected to wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography and then subjected to sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The Sp1 protein purified by this procedure is at least 95 % pure , and the overall recovery is greater than 80 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition to yielding larger quantities of Sp1 than conventional schemes , the new purification procedure is also simpler and more rapid .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We show that wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography can also be used to purify the glycosylated forms of the CCAAT-binding transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> aid the purification of other transcription factors that bear N-acetylglucosamine residues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , the ability to separate glycosylated forms of transcription factors from their unglycosylated counterparts by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> facilitate investigations into the role of N-acetylglucosamine residues in the functioning of transcription factor proteins</scope> .</sentence>
