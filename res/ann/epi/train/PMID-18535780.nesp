<sentence id="0">Highly homologous HERC proteins localize to endosomes and exhibit specific interactions with hPLIC and Nm23B .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Small HERC proteins are defined by the presence of one RCC1-like domain and a HECT domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Having evolved out of one common ancestor , the four members of the family exhibit a high degree of homology in genomic organization and amino acid sequence , thus it <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> that they <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> accomplish similar functions</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that small HERC proteins interact with each other and localize to the same cellular structures , which we identify as late endosomes and lysosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We demonstrate interaction of HERC3 with the ubiquitin-like proteins hPLIC-1 and hPLIC-2 and we establish interaction of HERC5 with the metastasis suppressor Nm23B .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While hPLIC proteins are <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> ubiquitinated by HERC3</scope> , HERC5 plays an important role in ubiquitination of Nm23B .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In summary , although small HERC proteins are highly homologous showing the same subcellular distribution , they undergo different molecular interactions .</sentence>
