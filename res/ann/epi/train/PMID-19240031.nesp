<sentence id="0">An endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane complex composed of SPFH1 and SPFH2 mediates the ER-associated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">How endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) proteins that are substrates for the ER-associated degradation ( ERAD ) pathway are recognized for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is largely unresolved .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors ( IP(3)Rs ) form tetrameric calcium channels in ER membranes , whose primary role is to control the release of ER calcium stores , but whose levels are also regulated , in an activation-dependent manner , by the ERAD pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report that the ER membrane protein SPFH1 and its homolog SPFH2 form a heteromeric approximately 2 MDa complex that binds to IP(3)R tetramers immediately after their activation and is required for their processing .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The complex is ring-shaped ( diameter approximately 250A ( ) , ) and RNA interference-mediated depletion of SPFH1 and SPFH2 blocks IP(3)R polyubiquitination and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that this novel SPFH1/2 complex is a recognition factor that targets IP(3)Rs and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">perhaps</cue> other</scope> substrates for ERAD</scope> .</sentence>
