<sentence id="0">Regulatory adaptation of isoprenoid biosynthesis and the LDL receptor pathway in fibroblasts from patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In a search for the pathophysiologic mechanisms , we estimated isoprenoid synthesis and concentration , cellular growth , and the activity of the LDL receptor pathway in fibroblasts from patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency ( MKD ) , a severe multisystemic disorder of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoid biosynthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In response to different concentrations of LDL and non-lipoprotein-bound cholesterol , MKD cells partially counteracted their enzyme defect by increased activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase ( results from earlier studies ) and the LDL receptor pathway , responses similar to the pharmacologic effects seen upon administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Rates of N-linked protein glycosylation , estimated as the amount of [14C]galactose-labeled macromolecules secreted into cell culture medium , were significantly decreased in MKD fibroblasts in comparison with control cells which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate</cue> alterations in the dolichol or dolichol phosphate pool</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In response to exogenous cholesterol , the major feedback inhibitor of isoprenoid biosynthesis , growth velocities of MKD fibroblasts declined in comparison with control cells , further <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> an impairment of non-sterol isoprenoid biosynthesis in MKD</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> an imbalance in the multilevel regulation of the biosynthesis of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoids in MKD , representing an additional causative factor responsible for the pre- and postnatal pathology of MKD</scope> .</sentence>
