<sentence id="0">P16 methylation in serum as a potential marker for the malignancy of colorectal carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The aim of the present study was to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">if</cue> p16 methylation in the serum can serve as a candidate marker for the malignancy of colorectal carcinoma</scope> , real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR ( RTQ-MSP ) was performed for p16 methylation in serum and the relationship between p16 methylation levels and clinicopathological findings of colorectal carcinoma was evaluated .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">RESULTS : The p16 methylation score significantly increased with tumor stage ( stage I=0.94+/-0.47 , stage 11=2.33+/-0.90 , stage 111=8.49+/-2.37 , stage IV=10.03+/-4.30 ) ( p=0.021 ; ANOVA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The p16 methylation score was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastasis ( p=0.001 ) and tumor invasion to the veins ( p=0.020 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The cumulative survival of patient groups according to the p16 methylation score ( more or less than 1 ) was examined .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , the group with a high p16 methylation score showed significantly worse survival rates than the group with a low p16 expression score ( p = 0.006 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CONCLUSION : The p16 methylation score <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> serve as a new parameter for the prognosis of colorectal carcinoma</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , p16 methylation was found in the serum of patients in all clinical stages , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="3"> early colorectal carcinoma <cue type="spec" id="3">could</cue> be detected using the RTQ-MSP method</scope></scope> .</sentence>
