<sentence id="0">The attachment protein of Hendra virus has high structural similarity but limited primary sequence homology compared with viruses in the genus Paramyxovirus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The complete nucleotide sequence of the attachment protein gene of Hendra virus , a new member of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae , has been determined from cDNA clones derived from viral genomic RNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The deduced mRNA is 2565 nucleotides long with one open reading frame encoding a protein of 604 amino acids , which is similar in size to the attachment protein of the members of the subfamily .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the mRNA transcript is > 600 nucleotides longer than others in the subfamily due to the presence of long untranslated regions at both the 5' and 3' ends .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The protein is designated G because it <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> both hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain close to the N terminus , eight <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> N-linked glycosylation sites</scope> , and 18 cysteine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although the HeV G protein had low sequence homology with Paramyxovirinae members , the predicted folding pattern of its extracellular globular head was very similar to that of members of the genus Paramyxovirus , with the location of seven potential pairs of sulfide bonds absolutely conserved .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">On the other hand , among the seven residues known to be critical for neuraminidase activity , only one was conserved in the Hendra virus G protein compared with at least six in HN proteins of paramyxoviruses and rubulaviruses and four in H proteins of morbilliviruses .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The biological significance of this finding is discussed .</sentence>
