<sentence id="0">Deubiquitinase USP9X stabilizes MCL1 and promotes tumour cell survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">MCL1 is essential for the survival of stem and progenitor cells of multiple lineages , and is unique among pro-survival BCL2 family members in that it is rapidly turned over through the action of ubiquitin ligases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">B- and mantle-cell lymphomas , chronic myeloid leukaemia , and multiple myeloma , however , express abnormally high levels of MCL1 , contributing to chemoresistance and disease relapse .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The mechanism of MCL1 overexpression in cancer is not well understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that the deubiquitinase USP9X stabilizes MCL1 and thereby promotes cell survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">USP9X binds MCL1 and removes the Lys 48-linked polyubiquitin chains that normally mark MCL1 for proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Increased USP9X expression correlates with increased MCL1 protein in human follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , patients with multiple myeloma overexpressing USP9X have a poor prognosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Knockdown of USP9X increases MCL1 polyubiquitination , which enhances MCL1 turnover and cell killing by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results identify USP9X as a prognostic and therapeutic target , and they show that deubiquitinases <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> stabilize labile oncoproteins in human malignancies</scope> .</sentence>
