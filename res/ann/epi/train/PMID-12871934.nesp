<sentence id="0">Differential glycosylation regulates processing of lipoprotein receptors by gamma-secretase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) belongs to a growing number of cell surface proteins that undergo regulated proteolytic processing that culminates in the release of their intracellular domain ( ICD ) by the intramembranous protease gamma-secretase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that LRP1 is differentially glycosylated in a tissue-specific manner and that carbohydrate addition reduces proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain and , concomitantly , ICD release .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) receptor-2 ( apoER2 ) , another member of the LDL receptor family with functions in cellular signal transmission , also undergoes sequential proteolytic processing , resulting in intracellular domain release into the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The penultimate processing step also involves cleavage of the apoER2 extracellular domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The rate at which this cleavage step occurs is determined by the glycosylation state of the receptor , which in turn is regulated by the alternative splicing of an exon encoding several O-linked sugar attachment sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> a role for differential and tissue-specific glycosylation as a physiological switch that modulates the diverse biological functions of these receptors in a cell-type specific manner</scope> .</sentence>
