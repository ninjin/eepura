<sentence id="0">The <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> oncogene GASC1</scope> demethylates tri- and dimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histone tails affects chromatin structure and gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tri- and dimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 ( H3K9me3/me2 ) is required for the binding of the repressive protein HP1 and is associated with heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression in a variety of species .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">H3K9me3 has long been regarded as a ' permanent ' epigenetic mark .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In a search for proteins and complexes interacting with H3K9me3 , we identified the protein GASC1 ( gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma 1 ) , which belongs to the JMJD2 ( jumonji domain containing 2 ) subfamily of the jumonji family , and is also known as JMJD2C .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we show that three members of this subfamily of proteins demethylate H3K9me3/me2 in vitro through a hydroxylation reaction requiring iron and alpha-ketoglutarate as cofactors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we demonstrate that ectopic expression of GASC1 or other JMJD2 members markedly decreases H3K9me3/me2 levels , increases H3K9me1 levels , delocalizes HP1 and reduces heterochromatin in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Previously , GASC1 was found to be amplified in several cell lines derived from oesophageal squamous carcinomas , and in agreement with a contribution of GASC1 to tumour development , inhibition of GASC1 expression decreases cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , in addition to identifying GASC1 as a histone trimethyl demethylase , we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> a model for how <scope type="spec" id="2"> this enzyme <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be involved in cancer development</scope></scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> it as a target for anti-cancer therapy</scope> .</sentence>
