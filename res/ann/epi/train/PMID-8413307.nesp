<sentence id="0">Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor expressed in a stably transfected cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Much of the definitive work on G-protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation and its impact on receptor function has been performed with the catecholamine receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Evidence for receptor phosphorylation is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> , however</scope> , for G-protein-coupled receptors that bind larger ligands , such as LH/CG .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using immunoprecipitation techniques and a clonal cell line stably transfected with the LH/CG receptor , we show here for the first time that exposure of cells to hCG induces phosphorylation of its cognate receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The hCG-induced increase in receptor phosphorylation requires receptor activation because it cannot be elicited with a hCG antagonist and is mediated at least in part by the cAMP second messenger system .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the hCG-induced receptor phosphorylation is greatly reduced ( but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> abolished )</scope> in a cell line that overexpresses cAMP phosphodiesterase and that receptor phosphorylation can be induced by activation of endogenous cAMP synthesis with prostaglandin E2 or by addition of 8-bromo-cAMP .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Last , we show that LH/CG receptor phosphorylation can be induced with a phorbol ester , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> with a calcium ionophore</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also examined a potential correlation between LH/CG receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling of the receptor from its effector .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Although <scope type="spec" id="3"> the phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the LH/CG receptor <cue type="spec" id="3">can</cue> be correlated with uncoupling , other experiments</scope> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> hCG-induced uncoupling of the LH/CG receptor can occur under conditions where the cAMP-mediated receptor phosphorylation is greatly reduced ( or abolished )</scope> .</sentence>
