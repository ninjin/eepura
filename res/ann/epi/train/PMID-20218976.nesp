<sentence id="0">Molecular and cellular characterization of Neuregulin-1 type IV isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Numerous genetic studies associated the Neuregulin 1 ( NRG1 ) Icelandic haplotype ( HAP(ice) ) , and its single nucleotide polymorphism SNP8NRG243177 [ T/T ] , with schizophrenia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because SNP8NRG243177 [ T/T ] has characteristics of a functional polymorphism that maps close to NRG1 type IV coding sequences , our initial goal was to map precisely the human type IV transcription initiation site .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We determined that the initiation site is 23 bp upstream of the previously reported type IV exon , and that no other transcripts map to the SNP8NRG243177 region .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Because NRG1 type IV transcripts are specific to human , we isolated full-length NRG1 type IV cDNAs from human hippocampi and expressed them in non-neural cells and dissociated rat hippocampal neurons to study protein expression , processing and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using an antiserum we generated against the NRG1 type IV-specific N-terminus , we found that the protein is targeted to the cell surface where PKC activation promotes its cleavage and release of the extracellular domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conditioned medium derived from type IV expressing cells stimulates ErbB receptor phosphorylation , as well as downstream Akt and Erk signaling , demonstrating that NRG1 type IV possesses biological activity similar to other releasable NRG1 isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">To study the subcellular targeting of distinct isoforms , neurons were transfected with the Ig-domain-containing NRG1 types I and IV , or the cysteine-rich domain type III isoform .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Three dimensional confocal images from transfected neurons <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> , whereas all isoforms are expressed on somato-dendritic membranes , only the type III-cysteine-rich domain isoform is detectable in distal axons</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that NRG1 type IV expression levels associated with SNP8NRG243177 [ T/T ] can selectively modify signaling of NRG1 released from somato-dendritic compartments , in contrast to the type III NRG1 that is also associated with axons</scope> .</sentence>
