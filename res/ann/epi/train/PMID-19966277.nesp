<sentence id="0">Opposing regulatory roles of phosphorylation and acetylation in DNA mispair processing by thymine DNA glycosylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CpG dinucleotides are mutational hotspots associated with cancer and genetic diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Thymine DNA glycosylase ( TDG ) plays an integral role in CpG maintenance by excising mispaired thymine and uracil in a CpG context and also participates in transcriptional regulation via gene-specific CpG demethylation and functional interactions with the transcription machinery .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report that protein kinase C alpha ( PKCalpha ) interacts with TDG and phosphorylates amino-terminal serine residues adjacent to lysines acetylated by CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) and p300 ( CBP/p300 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We establish that acetylation and phosphorylation are mutually exclusive , and their interplay dramatically alters the DNA mispair-processing functions of TDG .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Remarkably , acetylation of the amino-terminal region abrogates high-affinity DNA binding and selectively prevents processing of G:T mispairs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , phosphorylation does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> markedly alter DNA interactions</scope> , but <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> preserve G:T processing in vivo by preventing CBP-mediated acetylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Mutational analysis <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> that the acetyl-acceptor lysines are <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> directly involved in contacting DNA</scope> , but <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> constitute a conformationally sensitive interface that modulates DNA interactions</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings reveal opposing roles of CBP/p300 and PKCalpha in regulating the DNA repair functions of TDG and <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that the interplay of these modifications in vivo <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be critically important in the maintenance of CpG dinucleotides and epigenetic regulation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
