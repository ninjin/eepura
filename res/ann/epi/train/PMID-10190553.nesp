<sentence id="0">Regulation of connexin32 and connexin43 gene expression by DNA methylation in rat liver cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Gap junction proteins ( connexins ) are expressed in a cell-specific manner and expression is often reduced in neoplastic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the mechanisms of connexin32 ( Cx32 ) and connexin43 ( Cx43 ) expression in hepatic cells using MH1C1 rat hepatoma cells and freshly isolated , adult rat hepatocytes that express Cx32 but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> Cx43 and WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells that express Cx43 but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> Cx32</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Southern blotting after DNA restriction with MspI and HpaII <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> two MspI/HpaII restriction sites in the Cx32 promoter ( positions -147 and -847 ) were methylated in WB-F344 cells , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in MH1C1 cells or hepatocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , an MspI/HpaII restriction site in the Cx43 promoter ( position -38 ) was methylated in MH1C1 cells , but <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> in WB-F344 cells or hepatocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transient transfection of the cell lines with connexin promoter-luciferase constructs <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicated that</cue> the Cx32 promoter was 7-fold more active in MH1C1 cells and the Cx43 promoter was 5-fold more active in WB-F344 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that transcription of Cx32 and Cx43 in hepatic cells is controlled by promoter methylation and by cell-specific transcription factors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="7"> Similar mechanisms <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be involved in the reduced expression of these genes frequently observed in neoplastic cells</scope> .</sentence>
