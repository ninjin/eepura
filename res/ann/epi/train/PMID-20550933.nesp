<sentence id="0">ATM-dependent chromatin changes silence transcription in cis to DNA double-strand breaks .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) initiate extensive local and global alterations in chromatin structure , many of which depend on the ATM kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Histone H2A ubiquitylation ( uH2A ) on chromatin surrounding DSBs is one example , <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be important for recruitment of repair proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">uH2A is also implicated in transcriptional repression ; an intriguing yet untested hypothesis is that this function is conserved in the context of DSBs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using a novel reporter that allows for visualization of repair protein recruitment and local transcription in single cells , we describe an ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing program in cis to DSBs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">ATM prevents RNA polymerase II elongation-dependent chromatin decondensation at regions distal to DSBs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Silencing is partially dependent on E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 , whereas reversal of silencing relies on the uH2A deubiquitylating enzyme USP16 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These findings give insight into the role of posttranslational modifications in mediating crosstalk between diverse processes occurring on chromatin .</sentence>
