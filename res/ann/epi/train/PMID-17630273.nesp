<sentence id="0">A unique beta1,3-galactosyltransferase is indispensable for the biosynthesis of N-glycans containing Lewis a structures in Arabidopsis thaliana .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In plants , the only known outer-chain elongation of complex N-glycans is the formation of Lewis a [ Fuc alpha1-4(Gal beta1-3 ) GlcNAc-R ] structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This process involves the sequential attachment of beta1,3-galactose and alpha1,4-fucose residues by beta1,3-galactosyltransferase and alpha1,4-fucosyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the exact mechanism underlying the formation of Lewis a epitopes in plants is poorly understood , largely because one of the involved enzymes , beta1,3-galactosyltransferase , has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> yet been identified</scope> and characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report the identification of an Arabidopsis thaliana beta1,3-galactosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the Lewis a epitope using an expression cloning strategy .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Overexpression of various candidates led to the identification of a single gene ( named GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE1 [ GALT1 ] ) that increased the originally very low Lewis a epitope levels in planta .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Recombinant GALT1 protein produced in insect cells was capable of transferring beta1,3-linked galactose residues to various N-glycan acceptor substrates , and subsequent treatment of the reaction products with alpha1,4-fucosyltransferase resulted in the generation of Lewis a structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , transgenic Arabidopsis plants lacking a functional GALT1 mRNA did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> show any detectable amounts of Lewis a epitopes on endogenous glycoproteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , our results demonstrate that GALT1 is both sufficient and essential for the addition of beta1,3-linked galactose residues to N-glycans and thus is required for the biosynthesis of Lewis a structures in Arabidopsis .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Moreover , cell biological characterization of a transiently expressed GALT1-fluorescent protein fusion using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the exclusive location of GALT1 within the Golgi apparatus , which is in good agreement with the proposed physiological action of the enzyme .</sentence>
