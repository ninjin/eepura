<sentence id="0">Masking of a nuclear signal motif by monoubiquitination leads to mislocalization and degradation of the regulatory enzyme cytidylyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Monoubiquitination aids in the nuclear export and entrance of proteins into the lysosomal degradative pathway , although <scope type="spec" id="0"> the mechanisms are <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Cytidylyltransferase ( CCTalpha ) is a proteolytically sensitive lipogenic enzyme containing an NH(2)-terminal nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show here that CCTalpha is monoubiquitinated at a molecular site ( K(57) ) juxtaposed near its NLS , resulting in disruption of its interaction with importin-alpha , nuclear exclusion , and subsequent degradation within the lysosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Cellular expression of a CCTalpha-ubiquitin fusion protein that mimics the monoubiquitinated enzyme resulted in cytoplasmic retention .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A CCTalpha K(57R) mutant exhibited an extended half-life , was retained in the nucleus , and displayed proteolytic resistance .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Importantly , by using CCTalpha-ubiquitin hybrid constructs that vary in the intermolecular distance between ubiquitin and the NLS , we show that CCTalpha monoubiquitination masks its NLS , resulting in cytoplasmic retention .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results unravel a unique molecular mechanism whereby monoubiquitination governs the trafficking and life span of a critical regulatory enzyme in vivo .</sentence>
