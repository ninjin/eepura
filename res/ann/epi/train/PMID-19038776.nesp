<sentence id="0">APOBEC proteins and intrinsic resistance to HIV-1 infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Members of the APOBEC family of cellular polynucleotide cytidine deaminases , most notably APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F , are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Wild type HIV-1 infections are largely spared from APOBEC3G/F function through the action of the essential viral protein , Vif .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of Vif</scope> , APOBEC3G/F are encapsidated by budding virus particles leading to excessive cytidine ( C ) to uridine ( U ) editing of negative sense reverse transcripts in newly infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This registers as guanosine ( G ) to adenosine ( A ) hypermutations in plus-stranded cDNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition to this profoundly debilitating effect on genetic integrity , APOBEC3G/F also <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to inhibit viral DNA synthesis by impeding the translocation of reverse transcriptase along template RNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Because the functions of Vif and APOBEC3G/F proteins oppose each other , it is <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> that fluctuations in the Vif-APOBEC balance <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> influence the natural history of HIV-1 infection , as well as viral sequence diversification and evolution</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Given Vif 's critical role in suppressing APOBEC3G/F function , it can be argued that pharmacologic strategies aimed at restoring the activity of these intrinsic anti-viral factors in the context of infected cells in vivo have clear therapeutic merit , and therefore deserve aggressive pursuit .</sentence>
