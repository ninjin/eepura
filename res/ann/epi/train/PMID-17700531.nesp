<sentence id="0">Collagen matrix assembly is driven by the interaction of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein with hydroxylated collagen IV alpha 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) tumor suppressor gene predisposes to vascular tumor formation in several organs .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">VHL regulates two evolutionary conserved pathways : the targeting of hydroxylated hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha ( HIF-alpha ) for proteasomal degradation and the remodeling of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The biochemical mechanisms of the ECM assembly pathway remain poorly defined .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we provide evidence supporting a biochemical role for VHL in ECM assembly .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that VHL directly binds to the collagen IV alpha 2 ( COL4A2 ) chain and that this interaction is necessary for its assembly into the ECM .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The VHL-COL4A2 interaction is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated COL4A2 hydroxylation and independent of cytosolic , hypoxia regulated HIF-alpha-modifying enzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We find that the N-terminal tail of COL4A2 protrudes from the ER lumen into the cytosol where it is bound by VHL .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Failure of VHL to interact with COL4A2 correlates with loss of collagen IV network formation in vitro and collagen IV remodeling in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> a HIF-alpha-independent role for the VHL-COL4A2 interaction in suppression of angiogenic tumor formation through collagen IV network assembly</scope> .</sentence>
