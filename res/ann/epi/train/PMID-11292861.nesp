<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In oxygenated and iron replete cells , HIF-alpha subunits are rapidly destroyed by a mechanism that involves ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor ( pVHL ) E3 ligase complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This process is suppressed by hypoxia and iron chelation , allowing transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that the interaction between human pVHL and a specific domain of the HIF-1alpha subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue ( HIF-1alpha P564 ) by an enzyme we have termed HIF-alpha prolyl-hydroxylase ( HIF-PH ) .</sentence>
