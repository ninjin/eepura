<sentence id="0">RAD18 promotes DNA double-strand break repair during G1 phase through chromatin retention of 53BP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recruitment of RAD18 to stalled replication forks facilitates monoubiquitination of PCNA during S-phase , promoting translesion synthesis at sites of UV irradiation-induced DNA damage .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we show that RAD18 is also recruited to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced sites of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) forming foci which are co-localized with 53BP1 , NBS1 , phosphorylated ATM , BRCA1 and gamma-H2AX .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">RAD18 associates with 53BP1 and is recruited to DSB sites in a 53BP1-dependent manner specifically during G1-phase , RAD18 monoubiquitinates KBD domain of 53BP1 at lysine 1268 in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="neg" id="0">A monoubiquitination-resistant 53BP1 mutant harboring a substitution at lysine 1268 is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> retained efficiently at the chromatin in the vicinity of DSBs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In Rad18-null cells , retention of 53BP1 foci , efficiency of DSB repair and post-irradiation viability are impaired compared with wild-type cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that RAD18 promotes 53BP1-directed DSB repair by enhancing retention of 53BP1 , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibly</cue> through an interaction between RAD18 and 53BP1 and the modification of 53BP1</scope></scope> .</sentence>
