<sentence id="0">[ Aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma : is it clinically relevant ? ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During malignant transformation , the malignant cell accumulates epigenetic abnormalities that do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> alter the DNA sequence</scope> but are transmissible during divisions and modify genes expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The methylation of CpG islands in the tumor suppressor genes ( TS genes ) promoters inhibits their transcription ; it is a mecanism of gene inactivation as frequent as allelic deletions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The methylation profile ( or panel of methylated genes in a tumor ) , similarly to allelic deletions , varies with the tumor histology .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Within head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( oral cavity , larynx and oropharynx ) , 19 genes have been analysed , among them 5 are frequently methylated , i.e. : p16 , ECAD , DAPK , MGMT et TIMP3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The method of methylation analysis , based on a bisulfite treatment followed by a PCR amplification , is sensitive and specific enough to allow the detection of abnormalities in biological fluid that drain the tumor or in circulating tumoral DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , correlation between the methylation profile in tumor and paired saliva is excellent ; thus methylation analysis in saliva is a very promising approach for early cancer detection in high risk patients or for the post treatment follow up and rapid diagnosis of relapse .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The methylation signature <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> also reflect the tumor prognosis and complete the histology to define the diagnosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , DNA methylation is reversible with demethylating agents , a new avenue for cancer therapy in association with conventional chemotherapy .</sentence>
