<sentence id="0">Molecular requirements for polyamines binding to the antispermine monoclonal antibody Spm8-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The monoclonal antispermine antibody Spm8-2 was obtained by immunizing mice with a thyroglobulin-spermine conjugate .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The molecular requirements for polyamines binding to this antibody were investigated by ELISA binding and inhibition tests , using a variety of natural polyamines and synthetic polyamine analogs .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Four major structural determinants are important for the binding of polyamines by the antibody : ( 1 ) terminal amino groups : N-alkylation of both terminal amino groups of the polyamines leads to an important drop in the affinity for the antibody ; ( 2 ) number of methylene groups spacing the amino groups : the four carbon chains <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appear</cue> to present the optimum length since the antibody binds polyamines with repeats of the aminobutyl moiety more actively than their homologues with shorter or longer carbon chains ; ( 3 ) number of amino groups : the affinity of Spm8-2 for free homologous polyamines varied in the following order : pentamines > tetramines > triamines > diamines , showing the importance of the number of positive charges of the polyamines in the antibody-antigen reaction</scope> ; the importance of charges is further emphasized by the dependence of antibody binding on the ionic strength of the medium ; ( 4 ) N-acylation of one terminal amino group : the antibody binds more actively N1-acetylspermidine than spermidine or spermine .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The binding properties of Spm8-2 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> the presence of two recognition sequences , one selective for N-acylaminopropyl moieties , the second for the aminobutyl moiety</scope> .</sentence>
