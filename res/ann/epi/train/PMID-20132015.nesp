<sentence id="0">Histone deacetylase inhibitors improve in vitro and in vivo developmental competence of somatic cell nuclear transfer porcine embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Faulty epigenetic reprogramming of somatic nuclei is <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> to be a major cause of low success observed in all mammals produced through somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has been demonstrated that the developmental competence of SCNT embryos in several species were significantly enhanced via treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ) such as trichostatin A ( TSA ) to increase histone acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report that 50 nM TSA for 10 h after activation increased the developmental competence of porcine SCNT embryos constructed from Landrace fetal fibroblast cells ( FFCs ) in vitro and in vivo , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> at higher concentrations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Therefore , we optimized the application of another novel HDACi , Scriptaid , for development of porcine SCNT embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that treatment with 500 nM Scriptaid significantly enhanced the development SCNT embryos to the blastocyst stage when outbred Landrace FFCs and ear fibroblast cells ( EFCs ) were used as donors compared to the untreated group .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Scriptaid increased the overall cloning efficiency from 0.4 % ( untreated group ) to 1.6 % for Landrace FFCs and 0 to 3.7 % for Landrace EFCs .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , treatment of SCNT embryos with Scriptaid improved the histone acetylation on Histone H4 at lysine 8 ( AcH4K8 ) in a pattern similar to that of the in vitro fertilized ( IVF ) embryos .</sentence>
