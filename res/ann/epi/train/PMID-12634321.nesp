<sentence id="0">Complex-type biantennary N-glycans of recombinant human transferrin from Trichoplusia ni insect cells expressing mammalian [beta]-1,4-galactosyltransferase and [beta]-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A novel recombinant baculovirus expression vector was used to produce His-tagged human transferrin in a transformed insect cell line ( Tn5beta4GalT ) that constitutively expresses a mammalian beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This virus encoded the His-tagged human transferrin protein in conventional fashion under the control of the very late polyhedrin promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , to enhance the synthesis of galactosylated biantennary N-glycans , this virus encoded human beta-1,2- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II under the control of an immediate-early ( ie1 ) promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Detailed analyses by MALDI-TOF MS , exoglycosidase digestion , and two-dimensional HPLC revealed that the N-glycans on the purified recombinant human transferrin produced by this virus-host system included four different fully galactosylated , biantennary , complex-type glycans .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thus , this study describes a novel baculovirus-host system , which can be used to produce a recombinant glycoprotein with fully galactosylated , biantennary N-glycans .</sentence>
