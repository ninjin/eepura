<sentence id="0">Acetylation by GCN5 regulates CDC6 phosphorylation in the S phase of the cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In eukaryotic cells , the cell-division cycle (CDC)-6 protein is essential to promote the assembly of pre-replicative complexes in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle , a process requiring tight regulation to ensure that proper origin licensing occurs once per cell cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that , in late G1 and early S phase , CDC6 is found in a complex also containing Cyclin A , cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-2 and the acetyltransferase general control nonderepressible 5 ( GCN5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">GCN5 specifically acetylates CDC6 at three lysine residues flanking its cyclin-docking motif , and this modification is crucial for the subsequent phosphorylation of the protein by Cyclin A-CDKs at a specific residue close to the acetylation site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">GCN5-mediated acetylation and site-specific phosphorylation of CDC6 are both necessary for the relocalization of the protein to the cell cytoplasm in the S phase , as well as to regulate its stability .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="0"> This two-step , intramolecular regulatory program by sequential modification of CDC6 <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> to be essential for proper S-phase progression</scope> .</sentence>
