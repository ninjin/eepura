<sentence id="0">Association of N-glycosylation of apolipoprotein B-100 with plasma cholesterol levels in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously demonstrated the heterogeneity of N-linked sugar chains of apolipoprotein ( apo ) B-100 in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic ( WHHL ) rabbit and fasting Japanese White rabbits ( Arteriosclerosis , 10 ( 1990 ) 386-393 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate further the role of N-linked sugar chains of apo B-100 in lipid metabolism , we examined the correlation between the N-glycosylation of apo B-100 and serum cholesterol levels in WHHL rabbits .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The N-linked sugar chains of apo B-100 were liberated by hydrazinolysis , followed by NaB3H4 reduction and were fractionated by paper electrophoresis and BioGel P-4 column chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These were found to consist of one neutral ( N ) and two acidic fractions ( A1 and A2 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">N contained a high mannose type oligosaccharide consisting of Man5.GlcNAc2 to Man9.GlcNAc2 , while A1 and A2 contained monosialylated and disialylated complex type oligosaccharides , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The molar ratio varied among the 5 WHHL rabbits .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">There was an inverse correlation between the ratio of acidic oligosaccharide fractions ( A1 + A2 ) and serum cholesterol levels ( r = -0.971 , P less than 0.01 ) in the 5 WHHL rabbits .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> the N-glycosylation of apo B-100 is closely related to cholesterol metabolism in WHHL rabbits</scope> .</sentence>
