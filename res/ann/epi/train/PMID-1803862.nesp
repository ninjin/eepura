<sentence id="0">Role of glycosilation in the susceptibility of " acid labile " interferon alpha to acid treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mononuclear cells from blood of healthy donors produce acid-labile interferon ( IFN ) alpha when stimulated with HIV-infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> A large proportion of this IFN <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be glycosilated , as treatment with neuraminidase causes a shift of the isoelectric point ( IP ) from pH = 5.2-5.4 to pH = 5.8-6.2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To assess the role of glycosilation in determining the instability of antiviral activity after exposure to acid ( pH lower than 4 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were induced to produce IFN with HIV-infected cells in the presence of tunicamycin , an inhibitor of glycosilation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The IFN produced under such experimental conditions ( tu-IFN ) was acid-stable .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Tu-IFN was compared to a standard acid-labile IFN by affinity chromatography on Con A-sepharose .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The elution pattern showed that tu-IFN does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> bind to the gel</scope> , whereas the acid-labile IFN is eluted in two fractions , one unbound , which is stable at pH2 , and one bound , which retains the initial acid-lability .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that acid-labile IFN alpha is largely glycosilated , and that the presence of glycosilated molecules contribute to render the IFN molecule unstable at acidic pH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It is to be determined <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> some glycosilated molecule present in the IFN preparation , or glycosilation of the IFN molecule per se , is responsible for acid-lability of the antiviral activity</scope> .</sentence>
