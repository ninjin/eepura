<sentence id="0">Transcription-coupled deposition of histone modifications during MHC class II gene activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Posttranslational histone modifications associated with actively expressed genes are generally <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be introduced primarily by histone-modifying enzymes that are recruited by transcription factors or their associated co-activators</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have performed a comprehensive spatial and temporal analyses of the histone modifications that are deposited upon activation of the MHC class II gene HLA-DRA by the co-activator CIITA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We find that transcription-associated histone modifications are introduced during two sequential phases .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The first phase precedes transcription initiation and is characterized exclusively by a rapid increase in histone H4 acetylation over a large upstream domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">All other modifications examined , including the acetylation and methylation of several residues in histone H3 , are restricted to short regions situated at <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> within the 5' end of the gene</scope> and are established during a second phase that is concomitant with ongoing transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This second phase is completely abrogated when elongation by RNA polymerase II is blocked .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results provide strong evidence that transcription elongation can play a decisive role in the deposition of histone modification patterns associated with inducible gene activation .</sentence>
