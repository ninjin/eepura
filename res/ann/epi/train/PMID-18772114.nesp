<sentence id="0">Dual targeting of HSC70 and HSP72 inhibits HSP90 function and induces tumor-specific apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Heat-shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) isoforms contribute to tumorigenesis through their well-documented antiapoptotic activity and via their role as cochaperones for the HSP90 molecular chaperone .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HSP70 expression is induced following treatment with HSP90 inhibitors , which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> attenuate the cell death effects of this class of inhibitor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that silencing either heat-shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) or HSP72 expression in human cancer cell lines has <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on HSP90 activity or cell proliferation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , simultaneously reducing the expression of both of these isoforms induces proteasome-dependent degradation of HSP90 client proteins , G1 cell-cycle arrest , and extensive tumor-specific apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Importantly , simultaneous silencing of HSP70 isoforms in nontumorigenic cell lines does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> result in comparable growth arrest or induction of apoptosis</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating</cue> a potential therapeutic window</scope> .</sentence>
