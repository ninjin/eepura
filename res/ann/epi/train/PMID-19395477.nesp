<sentence id="0">Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma abrogates Smad-dependent collagen stimulation by targeting the p300 transcriptional coactivator .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPAR-gamma ) abrogate the stimulation of collagen gene transcription induced by transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we delineate the mechanisms underlying this important novel physiological function for PPAR-gamma in connective tissue homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">First , we demonstrated that antagonistic regulation of TGF-beta activity by PPAR-gamma ligands involves cellular PPAR-gamma , since 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) ( 15d-PGJ(2) ) <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to block TGF-beta-induced responses in either primary cultures of PPAR-gamma-null murine embryonic fibroblasts</scope> , or in normal human skin fibroblasts with RNAi-mediated knockdown of PPAR-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Next , we examined the molecular basis underlying the abrogation of TGF-beta signaling by PPAR-gamma in normal human fibroblasts in culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results demonstrated that Smad-dependent transcriptional responses were blocked by PPAR-gamma <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> preventing Smad2/3 activation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , the interaction between activated Smad2/3 and the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase p300 induced by TGF-beta , and the accumulation of p300 on consensus Smad-binding DNA sequences and histone H4 hyperacetylation at the COL1A2 locus , were all prevented by PPAR-gamma .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Wild-type p300 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> a mutant form of p300 lacking functional histone acetyltransferase</scope> , was able to restore TGF-beta-induced stimulation of COL1A2 in the presence of PPAR-gamma ligands .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Collectively , these results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> PPAR-gamma blocked Smad-mediated transcriptional responses by preventing p300 recruitment and histone H4 hyperacetylation , resulting in the inhibition of TGF-beta-induced collagen gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Pharmacological activation of PPAR-gamma thus <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> represent a novel therapeutic approach to target p300-dependent TGF-beta profibrotic responses such as stimulation of collagen gene expression</scope> .</sentence>
