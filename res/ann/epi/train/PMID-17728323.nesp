<sentence id="0">Identification of TRAF6-dependent NEMO polyubiquitination sites through analysis of a new NEMO mutation causing incontinentia pigmenti .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The regulatory subunit NEMO is involved in the mechanism of activation of IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) , the kinase complex that controls the NF-kappaB signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">During this process , NEMO is modified post-translationally through K63-linked polyubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We report the molecular characterization of a new missense mutation of NEMO ( A323P ) which causes a severe form of incontinentia pigmenti ( OMIM#308300 ) , an inherited disease characterized predominantly by skin inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The A323P mutation was found to impair TNF- , IL-1- , LPS- and PMA/ionomycin-induced NF-kappaB activation , as well as to disrupt TRAF6-dependent NEMO polyubiquitination , due to a defective NEMO/TRAF6 interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mutagenesis identified the affected ubiquitination sites as three lysine residues located in the vicinity of A323 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Unexpectedly , these lysines were ubiquitinated together with two previously identified lysines not connected to TRAF6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Mutation of all these ubiquitination sites severely impaired NF-kappaB activation induced by stimulation with IL-1 , LPS , Nod2/RICK or serum/LPA .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , mutation at all of these sites had only a limited effect on stimulation by TNF .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> post-translational modification of NEMO through K63-linked polyubiquitination is a key event in IKK activation and that perturbation of this step <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> cause human pathophysiology</scope></scope> .</sentence>
