<sentence id="0">HSCARG regulates NF-kappaB activation by promoting the ubiquitination of RelA or COMMD1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The redox sensor protein HSCARG translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to decreased cellular NADPH or increased nitric oxide , and is involved in protein regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the regulatory mechanism of HSCARG has remained elusive .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this report , through a yeast two-hybrid screen , HSCARG was found to associate with the copper metabolism gene MURR1 domain containing protein 1 ( COMMD1 ) , an inhibitor of NF-kappaB , and negatively regulate COMMD1 by accelerating its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , we observed that HSCARG also blocked basal and stimulus-coupled NF-kappaB activation by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of the NF-kappaB subunit RelA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further analyses showed that in cells under normal conditions , HSCARG localized mainly in the cytoplasm and acted as a negative regulator of COMMD1 , and was distributed in the nucleus in small quantities to inhibit NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although in response to intracellular redox changes by dehydroepiandrosterone or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine treatment , a large amount of HSCARG translocated to the nucleus , which terminated NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Meanwhile , COMMD1 was restored due to decreased cytoplasmic HSCARG levels and negatively regulated NF-kappaB as well .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , NF-kappaB activation was terminated efficiently .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> HSCARG plays critical roles in regulation of NF-kappaB in response to cellular redox changes by promoting ubiquitination and proteolysis of RelA or COMMD1</scope> .</sentence>
