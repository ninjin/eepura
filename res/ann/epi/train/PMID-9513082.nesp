<sentence id="0">Expression and purification of biologically active porcine follicle-stimulating hormone in insect cells bearing a baculovirus vector .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Biologically active recombinant porcine FSH ( rec-pFSH ) free from the cognate pituitary glycoprotein hormone LH was produced .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It was synthesized by a baculovirus vector-insect cell system using two cDNAs encoding the glycoprotein alpha and FSH beta subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Its antigenicity was the same as that of pFSH prepared from the pituitary .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Glycosylation of rec-pFSH was shown by tunicamycin treatment but the molecular mass of each subunit was lower than that of pituitary-derived FSH , because of the absence of trimming of terminal sugars in insect cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Rec-pFSH was secreted into the culture medium at about 1 mg/l and purified in six fractions , because of the heterogeneity of the sugar group , by S-Sepharose and concanavalin A-Sepharose column chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The biological activity of rec-pFSH was examined by measuring its effect on progesterone secretion from porcine granulosa cells and germinal vesicle breakdown ( GVBD ) of porcine oocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It showed adequate activity with respect to progesterone secretion , although some fractions rich in the sugar group showed lower activity than that of pituitary-derived FSH .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It exhibited higher GVBD activity than that of pituitary-derived FSH at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results demonstrate that the baculovirus vector-insect cell system can provide biologically active rec-pFSH .</sentence>
