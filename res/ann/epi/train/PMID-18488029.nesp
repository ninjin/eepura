<sentence id="0">Gene silencing in cancer by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation independent of promoter DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epigenetic silencing in cancer cells is mediated by at least two distinct histone modifications , polycomb-based histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation ( H3K27triM ) and H3K9 dimethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The relationship between DNA hypermethylation and these histone modifications is not completely understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using chromatin immunoprecipitation microarrays ( ChIP-chip ) in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostate , we found that up to 5 % of promoters ( 16 % CpG islands and 84 % non-CpG islands ) were enriched with H3K27triM .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These genes were silenced specifically in prostate cancer , and those CpG islands affected showed low levels of DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Downregulation of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase restored expression of the H3K27triM target genes alone or in synergy with histone deacetylase inhibition , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> affecting promoter DNA methylation</scope> , and with <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on the expression of genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data establish EZH2-mediated H3K27triM as a mechanism of tumor-suppressor gene silencing in cancer that is <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> independent of promoter DNA methylation</scope> .</sentence>
