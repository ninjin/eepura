<sentence id="0">Prolyl hydroxylation of collagen type I is required for efficient binding to integrin alpha 1 beta 1 and platelet glycoprotein VI but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> to alpha 2 beta 1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Collagen is a potent adhesive substrate for cells , an event essentially mediated by the integrins alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 2 beta 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Collagen fibrils also bind to the integrin alpha 2 beta 1 and the platelet receptor glycoprotein VI to activate and aggregate platelets .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The distinct triple helical recognition motifs for these receptors , GXOGER and (GPO)n , respectively , all contain hydroxyproline .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using unhydroxylated collagen I produced in transgenic plants , we investigated the role of hydroxyproline in the receptor-binding properties of collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that alpha 2 beta 1 but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> alpha 1 beta 1</scope> mediates cell adhesion to unhydroxylated collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Soluble recombinant alpha 1 beta 1 binding to unhydroxylated collagen is considerably reduced compared with bovine collagens , but binding can be restored by prolyl hydroxylation of recombinant collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also show that platelets use alpha 2 beta 1 to adhere to the unhydroxylated recombinant molecules , but the adhesion is weaker than on fully hydroxylated collagen , and the unhydroxylated collagen fibrils <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">fail</cue> to aggregate platelets</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Prolyl hydroxylation is thus required for binding of collagen to platelet glycoprotein VI and to cells by alpha 1 beta 1 .</sentence>
