<sentence id="0">Tip60-dependent acetylation of p53 modulates the decision between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Upon DNA damage and other types of stress , p53 induces either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the cellular context .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the molecular mechanisms that govern the choice between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> well understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that Tip60 is required for both cell growth arrest and apoptosis mediated by p53 and also induces its acetylation specifically at lysine 120 ( K120 ) within the DNA-binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , this modification is crucial for p53-dependent apoptosis but is dispensable for its mediated growth arrest .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">K120 is a recurrent site for p53 mutation in human cancer , and the corresponding acetylation-defective tumor mutant ( K120R ) abrogates p53-mediated apoptosis , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> growth arrest</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , our study demonstrates that Tip60-dependent acetylation of p53 at K120 modulates the decision between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis , and it reveals that the DNA-binding core domain is an important target for p53 regulation by posttranslational modifications .</sentence>
