<sentence id="0">60th residues of ubiquitin and Nedd8 are located out of E2-binding surfaces , but are important for K48 ubiquitin-linkage .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nedd8 , a ubiquitin-like modifier , is covalently attached to various proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although Nedd8 has higher sequence identity ( 57 % ) with ubiquitin , its conserved K48 residue cannot form covalent linkage with ubiquitin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To decipher the reason why Nedd8 cannot be an effective ubiquitin-acceptor , we compared the non-covalent interaction between Nedd8 and ubiquitin for various E2s using cross-saturation NMR technique .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , both Nedd8 and ubiquitin displayed almost identical non-covalent E2-binding properties .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The K60 of Nedd8 was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> present at the E2-binding surface</scope> , but its mutation to Asn converted Nedd8 into a ubiquitin-acceptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The N60 ubiquitin mutants also displayed a decreased ubiquitin-accepting activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> the presence of an uncharacterized determinant for the K48 ubiquitin-linkage that is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> related to non-covalent E2-bindings</scope></scope> .</sentence>
