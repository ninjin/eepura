<sentence id="0">RCS1 , a substrate of APC/C , controls the metaphase to anaphase transition .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ( APC/C ) controls the onset of anaphase by targeting securin for destruction .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report here the identification and characterization of a substrate of APC/C , RCS1 , as a mitotic regulator that controls the metaphase-to-anaphase transition .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We showed that the levels of RCS1 fluctuate in the cell cycle , peaking in mitosis and dropping drastically as cells exit into G(1) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Indeed , RCS1 is efficiently ubiquitinated by APC/C in vitro and degraded during mitotic exit in a Cdh1-dependent manner in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">APC/C recognizes a unique D-box at the N terminus of RCS1 , as mutations of this D-box abolished ubiquitination in vitro and stabilized the mutant protein in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RCS1 controls the timing of the anaphase onset , because the loss of RCS1 resulted in a faster progression from the metaphase to anaphase and accelerated degradation of securin and cyclin B .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Biochemically , mitotic RCS1 associates with the NuRD chromatin-remodeling complex , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> this RCS1 complex is <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> involved in regulating gene expression or chromatin structure , which in turn <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> control anaphase onset</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our study uncovers a complex regulatory network for the metaphase-to-anaphase transition .</sentence>
