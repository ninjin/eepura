<sentence id="0">The HLA-DRalpha chain is modified by polyubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ubiquitination plays a major role in regulating cell surface and intracellular localization of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Two E3 ligases , MARCH I and MARCH VIII , have been shown to polyubiquitinate lysine residue 225 in the cytoplasmic tail of I-Abeta and HLA-DRbeta .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that lysine residue 219 in the cytoplasmic tail of DRalpha is also subject to polyubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Each chain of the HLA-DR heterodimer is independently recognized and ubiquitinated , but DRbeta is more extensively modified .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the cytoplasmic tail of DRbeta lysine , residue 225 is the only residue that is absolutely required for ubiquitination ; all other residues can be deleted or substituted without loss of function .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , although lysine 219 is absolutely required for modification of DRalpha , other features of the DRalpha tail act to limit the extent of ubiquitination .</sentence>
