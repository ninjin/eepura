<sentence id="0">Site-specific ubiquitination exposes a linear motif to promote interferon-alpha receptor endocytosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ligand-induced endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of cognate receptors regulate the extent of cell signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Along with linear endocytic motifs that recruit the adaptin protein complex 2 (AP2)-clathrin molecules , monoubiquitination of receptors has emerged as a major endocytic signal .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">By investigating ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation of the interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta receptor 1 ( IFNAR1 ) subunit of the type I IFN receptor , we reveal that IFNAR1 is polyubiquitinated via both Lys48- and Lys63-linked chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The SCF(betaTrcp) ( Skp1-Cullin1-F-box complex ) E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation in cells can conjugate both types of chains in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although either polyubiquitin linkage suffices for postinternalization sorting , both types of chains are necessary but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> sufficient for robust IFNAR1 turnover and internalization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These processes also depend on the proximity of ubiquitin-acceptor lysines to a linear endocytic motif and on its integrity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , ubiquitination of IFNAR1 promotes its interaction with the AP2 adaptin complex that is required for the robust internalization of IFNAR1 , implicating cooperation between site-specific ubiquitination and the linear endocytic motif in regulating this process .</sentence>
