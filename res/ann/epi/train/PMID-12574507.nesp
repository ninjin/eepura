<sentence id="0">Lysine-79 of histone H3 is hypomethylated at silenced loci in yeast and mammalian cells : a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> mechanism for position-effect variegation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of lysine-79 ( K79 ) within the globular domain of histone H3 by Dot1 methylase is important for transcriptional silencing and for association of the Sir silencing proteins in yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that the level of H3-K79 methylation is low at all Sir-dependent silenced loci but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> at other transcriptionally repressed regions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Hypomethylation of H3-K79 at the telomeric and silent mating-type loci , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> the ribosomal DNA</scope> , requires the Sir proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Overexpression of Sir3 concomitantly extends the domain of Sir protein association and H3-K79 hypomethylation at telomeres .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In mammalian cells , H3-K79 methylation is found at loci that are active for V(D)J recombination , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> at recombinationally inactive loci that are heterochromatic</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that H3-K79 methylation is an evolutionarily conserved marker of active chromatin regions , and that silencing proteins block the ability of Dot1 to methylate histone H3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Further , they <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that Sir proteins preferentially bind chromatin with hypomethylated H3-K79 and then block H3-K79 methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This positive feedback loop , and the reverse loop in which H3-K79 methylation weakens Sir protein association and leads to further methylation , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggests</cue> a model for position-effect variegation</scope> .</sentence>
