<sentence id="0">Expression of histone acetyltransferases was down-regulated in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-deficient murine cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappaB-dependent , as well as human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV-1 ) long terminal repeat (LTR)-dependent , reporter gene expression was significantly impaired in cells derived from poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)-knockout ( PARP-1 -/- ) mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , the level of protein acetylation was markedly lower in PARP-1 -/- cells than control ( PARP-1 +/+ ) cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Surprisingly , the expression levels of histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) , p300 , cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein ( CBP ) , and p300/CBP-associated factor ( PCAF ) , were significantly reduced in PARP-1 -/- cells , as compared with PARP-1 +/+ cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that PARP-1 is required for the proper expression of particular HATs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since p300 and CBP are coactivators of NF-kappaB , we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> here that PARP-1 participates in NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by means of maintaining the expression of HATs</scope> .</sentence>
