<sentence id="0">Functional mapping of the nucleoprotein of Ebola virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">At 739 amino acids , the nucleoprotein ( NP ) of Ebola virus is the largest nucleoprotein of the nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses , and like the NPs of other viruses , it plays a central role in virus replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Huang et al. ( Y. Huang , L. Xu , Y. Sun , and G. J. Nabel , Mol . Cell 10:307-316 , 2002 ) previously demonstrated that NP , together with the minor matrix protein VP24 and polymerase cofactor VP35 , is necessary and sufficient for the formation of nucleocapsid-like structures that are morphologically indistinguishable from those seen in Ebola virus-infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">They further showed that NP is O glycosylated and sialylated and that these modifications are important for interaction between NP and VP35 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , little is known about the structure-function relationship of Ebola virus NP .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we examined the glycosylation of Ebola virus NP and further investigated its properties by generating deletion mutants to define the region(s) involved in NP-NP interaction ( self-assembly ) , in the formation of nucleocapsid-like structures , and in the replication of the viral genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to identify the types of glycosylation and sialylation</scope> , although we did confirm that Ebola virus NP was glycosylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also determined that the region from amino acids 1 to 450 is important for NP-NP interaction ( self-assembly ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We further demonstrated that these amino-terminal 450 residues and the following 150 residues are required for the formation of nucleocapsid-like structures and for viral genome replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">advance</cue> our understanding of the functional region(s) of Ebola virus NP , which in turn <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">should</cue> improve our knowledge of the Ebola virus life cycle and its extreme pathogenicity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
