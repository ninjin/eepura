<sentence id="0">The acetylation state of human fetal hemoglobin modulates the strength of its subunit interactions : long-range effects and implications for histone interactions in the nucleosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The source of the 70-fold increased tetramer strength of liganded fetal hemoglobin relative to that of adult hemoglobin between pH 6.0 and 7.5 reported earlier [ Dumoulin et al. ( 1997 ) J. Biol. Chem. 272 , 31326 ] has been identified as the N-terminal Gly residue of the gamma-chain , which is replaced by Val in adult hemoglobin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This was revealed by extending the study of the pH dependence of the tetramer-dimer equilibrium of these hemoglobins into the alkaline range as far as pH 9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">From pH 7.5 to 9.0 , the 70-fold difference in the association equilibrium constant between hemoglobins F and A lessened progressively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This behavior was attributed to the difference in the pK(a) 8.1 of Gly-1(gamma) compared to the pK(a) 7.1 value of Val-1(beta) of hemoglobins F and A , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Evidence for this conclusion was obtained by demonstrating that natural hemoglobin F(1) , which is specifically acetylated at Gly-1(gamma) and hence <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to be protonated</scope> , behaves like HbA and not HbF in its tetramer-dimer association properties over the pH range studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="1"> An increased degree of protonation of the gamma-chain N-terminus of hemoglobin F from pH 9.0 to 8.0 is therefore <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> as responsible for its increased tetramer strength representing an example of transmission of a signal from its positively charged N-terminal tail to the distant subunit allosteric interface where the equilibrium constant is measured</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">An analogy is made between the effects of acetylation of the fetal hemoglobin tetramer on the strength of its subunit interactions and acetylation of some internal Lys residues within the N-terminal segments of the histone octamer around which DNA is wrapped in the nucleosome .</sentence>
