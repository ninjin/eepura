<sentence id="1">Pt compounds still represent the mainstay of the treatment of ovarian carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular bases of resistance to Pt drugs using an oxaliplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell model IGROV-1/OHP .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These cells exhibited high levels of resistance to oxaliplatin , cross-resistance to cisplatin and topotecan and displayed a marked accumulation defect of Pt drugs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This feature was associated with increased expression and altered N-linked glycosylation of ATP binding cassette transporters MRP1 and MRP4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Pre-treatment with tunicamycin , which inhibits the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides , decreased the accumulation of Pt in sensitive cells exposed to oxaliplatin or cisplatin and increased the electrophoretic mobility of MRP1 and MRP4 , reproducing the association between decreased glycosylation of MRP1 and MRP4 and decreased Pt accumulation observed in the resistant IGROV-1/OHP cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The observed N-glycosylation defect of oxaliplatin-resistant cells was linked to reduced levels of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase ( GNPTG ) and mannosyl (alpha-1,6-)-glycoprotein beta-1,6-N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase ( MGAT5 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This feature , observed in IGROV-1/OHP cells , was associated with decreased retention of Pt drugs .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , the overexpression of fully glycosylated MRP1 or MRP4 in tumor cell line of ovarian origin was associated with resistance to oxaliplatin and cisplatin .</sentence>
