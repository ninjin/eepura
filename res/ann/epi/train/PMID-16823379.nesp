<sentence id="0">Probing long-distance regulatory interactions in the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex using Dam identification .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A cis-regulatory region of nearly 300 kb controls the expression of the three bithorax complex ( BX-C ) homeotic genes : Ubx , abd-A and Abd-B .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Interspersed between the numerous enhancers and silencers within the complex are elements called domain boundaries .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , many pieces of evidence have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that boundaries function to create autonomous domains by interacting among themselves and forming chromatin loops</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In order to test this hypothesis , we used Dam identification to probe for interactions between the Fab-7 boundary and other regions in the BX-C .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We were surprised to find that the targeting of Dam methyltransferase ( Dam ) to the Fab-7 boundary results in a strong methylation signal at the Abd-Bm promoter , approximately 35 kb away .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , this methylation pattern is found primarily in the tissues where <scope type="neg" id="1">Abd-B is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> expressed</scope> and requires an intact Fab-7 boundary .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Overall , our work provides the first documented example of a dynamic , long-distance physical interaction between distal regulatory elements within a living , multicellular organism .</sentence>
