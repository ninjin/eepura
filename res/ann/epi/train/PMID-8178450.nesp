<sentence id="0">Sequence-specific methylation inhibits the activity of the Epstein-Barr virus LMP 1 and BCR2 enhancer-promoter regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We reported earlier that variable expression of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) encoded membrane protein LMP 1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and the host-cell-phenotype-dependent activity of the BCR2 promoter ( one of the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> initiator sites for transcripts of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens ) in Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) lines</scope> can be related to the methylation status of the 5'-flanking regulatory regions of the BNLF 1 and BCR2 promoter , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we report that clones of the BL line Mutu that differ in expression of LMP 1 also show a differential methylation pattern of the LMP 1 regulatory sequences : this region is hypomethylated in an LMP 1 expressing ( group III ) clone but methylated in a group I clone that does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> express LMP 1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We introduced in vitro methylated reporter plasmids carrying BNLF 1 and BCR2 enhancer-promoter sequences into the BL line Raji and found that overall methylation of 5'-CG-3 ' sequences by the Spiroplasma methylase Sssl significantly reduced their activity compared to unmethylated or mock-methylated controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Methylation of 5-CCGG-3 ' sequences by Hpall methyltransferase gave similar results .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">On the contrary , methylation of 5'GCGC-3 ' sequences by Hhall methyltransferase gave similar results .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the contrary , methylation of 5'-GCGC-3 ' sequences by Hpal methyltransferase resulted only in a moderate reduction of BNLF 1 enhancer-promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data support the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">notion</cue> that methylation at discrete sites within control regions of latent , growth-transformation associated EBV genes <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> contribute to silencing their expression</scope></scope> .</sentence>
