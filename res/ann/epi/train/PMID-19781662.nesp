<sentence id="0">Role of DNA methylation and methyl-DNA binding proteins in the repression of 5-lipoxygenase promoter activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) is the key enzyme in the formation of inflammatory leukotrienes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">5-LO gene expression is mainly restricted to B cells and cells of myeloid origin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It is known that basal 5-lipoxygenase promoter activity is regulated by DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study we investigated the impact of the DNA methylation status of the 5-LO promoter on its activity and the role of methyl DNA binding proteins ( MBDs ) in transcriptional silencing of the 5-LO promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using ChIP assays , we found that the methyl-DNA binding proteins MBD1 , MBD2 and MeCP2 bind to the methylated 5-LO core promoter in U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Knock down of each of the MBDs upregulates 5-LO mRNA expression in U937 cells <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> these proteins are involved in silencing of the 5-LO gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In reporter gene assays with in vitro methylated 5-LO promoter constructs , the extent of 5-LO promoter methylation inversely correlated with its activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , we found that MBD1 overexpression repressed 5-LO promoter activity when the CpG sites at the Sp1 binding site close to the transcriptional start site ( GC4 ) were methylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Gel shift data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> recruitment of Sp1 to this binding site is prevented by methylation</scope> .</sentence>
