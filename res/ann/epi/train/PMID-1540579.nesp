<sentence id="0">Arginine residues as stabilizing elements in proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Site-specific substitutions of arginine for lysine in the thermostable D-xylose isomerase ( XI ) from Actinoplanes missouriensis are shown to impart significant heat stability enhancement in the presence of sugar substrates most <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">probably</cue> by interfering with nonenzymatic glycation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The same substitutions are also found to increase heat stability in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of any sugar derivatives</scope> , where a mechanism based on prevention of glycation can <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no longer</cue> be invoked</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This rather conservative substitution is moreover shown to improve thermostability in two other structurally unrelated proteins , human copper , zinc-superoxide dismutase ( CuZnSOD ) and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) from Bacillus subtilis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The stabilizing effect of Lys----Arg substitutions is rationalized on the basis of a detailed analysis of the crystal structures of wild-type XI and of engineered variants with Lys----Arg substitution at four distinct locations , residues 253 , 309 , 319 , and 323 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Molecular model building analysis of the structures of wild-type and mutant CuZnSOD ( K9R ) and GAPDH ( G281K and G281R ) is used to explain the observed stability enhancement in these proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition to demonstrating that even thermostable proteins can lend themselves to further stability improvement , our findings provide direct evidence that arginine residues are important stabilizing elements in proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , the stabilizing role of electrostatic interactions , particularly between subunits in oligomeric proteins , is documented .</sentence>
