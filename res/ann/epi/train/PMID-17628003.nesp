<sentence id="0">Activation of endoproteolytic processing of insulin-like growth factor-II in fetal , early postnatal , and pregnant rats and persistence of circulating levels in postnatal life .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The process of posttranslational modifications of IGF-II <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> has important physiological consequences</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition to mature IGF-II , glycosylated proIGF-II(156-amino acid peptide ) and two glycosylated big IGF-II forms , IGF-II(1-104) and IGF-II(1-87) , have been identified in the human circulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Due to <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of an appropriate methodology</scope> , different IGF-II isoforms have <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> been demonstrated and characterized in the rat circulation</scope> , thus preventing a better understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of IGF-II .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study , we characterized each IGF-II form and assessed its content in the rat circulation throughout life time by using a highly sensitive Western blot analysis , which is void of the IGF binding protein interference and distinguished all IGF-II forms .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">For the first time , we demonstrated the presence of IGF-II variants , including proIGF-II , IGF-II(1-87) , and mature IGF-II , in the rat circulation during postnatal life , challenging the current impression that IGF-II is absent from sera of adult rats .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">ProIGF-II is glycosylated and is the predominant form in the rat circulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Endoproteolytic processing of proIGF-II was clearly activated in fetal , neonatal , and pregnant rats , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">likely</cue> reflecting its involvement in fetal development through the generation of specific forms of IGF-II ( e.g. mature IGF-II ) that are required for their distinct biological functions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Taken together , our data also <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that serum IGF-II profiles <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> reflect underlying physiological conditions</scope></scope> .</sentence>
