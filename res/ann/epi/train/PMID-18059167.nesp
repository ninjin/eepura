<sentence id="0">Inhibition of Stat3 activity by YC-1 enhances chemo-sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The present study investigated the effect of YC-1 , a novel anti-cancer agent , on the chemo-sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">YC-1 was administered with chemo-cytotoxic drug , cisplatin , both in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">YC-1 alone downregulated the expression of phosphorylated form of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 ( P-Stat3 [ 705 ] ) , a key mediator in chemo-resistance .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When combined with cisplatin , YC-1 further promoted tumor cell apoptosis , decreased the expression of P-Stat3(705) , Bcl-xL , CyclinD1 and survivin , and induced the cleavage of caspase 9 and PARP .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Overexpression of Stat3 reversed YC-1 induced cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">YC-1 inhibited Stat3 activity by enhancing the polyubiquitination of P-Stat3(705) induced by cisplatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the in vivo setting , YC-1 combined with cisplatin remarkably suppressed tumor growth in a HCC xenograft model , and this effect was also accompanied by YC-1 mediated downregulation of P-Stat3(705) , Bcl-xL , Cyclin D1 and survivin , and induction of cleaved caspase 9 and PARP in the tumor tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In conclusion , the present study demonstrated a novel anti-cancer effect of YC-1 in enhancing chemo-sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin through a Stat3 dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This finding provides insight into design of a new therapeutic strategy to improve efficacy of chemotherapy in HCC patients .</sentence>
