<sentence id="0">TACI induces cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of NIK by TRAF2 and TANK to limit non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family ( BAFF ) is a critical factor for B-cell survival and maturation through non-canonical nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) pathway , a NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK)-dependent pathway for the processing of NF-kappaB2 p100 to generate p52 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While BAFF acts primarily through BAFF receptor ( BAFF-R ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the transmembrane activator and CAML interactor ( TACI ) , the other receptor for BAFF , is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to serve as a negative regulator for B-cell responses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , how TACI regulates NF-kappaB2 activity is largely unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we showed that constitutive activation of TACI signaling suppressed BAFF-R-mediated NF-kappaB2 p100 processing with the up-regulation of cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 ( cIAP1 ) and TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF)-associated NF-kappaB activator ( TANK ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The ubiquitination of NIK by cIAP1 was inhibited by the expression of TRAF2 with physical binding to cIAP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">TANK deficiency by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) impaired TACI-dependent inhibition of NF-kappaB2 p100 processing .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">TANK also inhibited TRAF2-mediated cIAP1 inactivation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , the recruitment of TRAF2 to TACI induced the ubiquitination of NIK .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , the regulation of NIK by TACI through the interaction of TANK/TRAF2/cIAP1 plays a pivotal role in the suppression of non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling .</sentence>
