<sentence id="0">Modification by single ubiquitin moieties <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> polyubiquitination</scope> is sufficient for proteasomal processing of the p105 NF-kappaB precursor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Activation of NF-kappaB is regulated via numerous ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated steps ; an important one is processing of the precursor p105 to the p50 active subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mechanisms involved are largely unknown , because this is an exceptional case where the ubiquitin system does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> destroy its substrate completely</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we demonstrate that proteasomal processing of p105 requires ubiquitin but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> generation of polyubiquitin chains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In vitro , ubiquitin species that cannot polymerize mediate processing .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In yeasts that express nonpolymerizable ubiquitins , processing proceeds normally , whereas degradation of substrates that are dependent on polyubiquitination is inhibited .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Similar results were obtained in mammalian cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , processing requires multiple monoubiquitinations , because progressive elimination of lysines in p105 is accompanied by gradual inhibition of p50 generation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , the proteasome recognizes the multiply monoubiquitinated p105 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that a proteolytic signal can be composed of a cluster of single ubiquitins , not necessarily a chain</scope> .</sentence>
