<sentence id="0">Reprogramming towards pluripotency requires AID-dependent DNA demethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei to yield induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells makes <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> derivation of patient-specific stem cells for regenerative medicine</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , iPS cell generation is asynchronous and slow ( 2-3 weeks ) , the frequency is low ( < 0.1 % ) , and DNA demethylation constitutes a bottleneck .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine regulatory mechanisms involved in reprogramming , we generated interspecies heterokaryons ( fused mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and human fibroblasts ) that induce reprogramming synchronously , frequently and fast .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that reprogramming towards pluripotency in single heterokaryons is initiated <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> cell division or DNA replication</scope> , rapidly ( 1 day ) and efficiently ( 70 % ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown showed that activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID , also known as AICDA ) is required for promoter demethylation and induction of OCT4 ( also known as POU5F1 ) and NANOG gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">AID protein bound silent methylated OCT4 and NANOG promoters in fibroblasts , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> active demethylated promoters in ES cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data provide new evidence that mammalian AID is required for active DNA demethylation and initiation of nuclear reprogramming towards pluripotency in human somatic cells .</sentence>
