<sentence id="0">Polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen by HLTF and SHPRH prevents genomic instability from stalled replication forks .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chronic stalling of DNA replication forks caused by DNA damage <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> lead to genomic instability</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Cells have evolved lesion bypass pathways such as postreplication repair ( PRR ) to resolve these arrested forks .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In yeast , one branch of PRR involves proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) polyubiquitination mediated by the Rad5-Ubc13-Mms2 complex that allows bypass of DNA lesion by a template-switching mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Previously , we identified human SHPRH as a functional homologue of yeast Rad5 and revealed the existence of RAD5-like pathway in human cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we report the identification of HLTF as a second RAD5 homologue in human cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">HLTF , like SHPRH , shares a unique domain architecture with Rad5 and promotes lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similar to yeast Rad5 , HLTF is able to interact with UBC13 and PCNA , as well as SHPRH ; and the reduction of either SHPRH or HLTF expression enhances spontaneous mutagenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , Hltf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts show elevated chromosome breaks and fusions after methyl methane sulfonate treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that HLTF and SHPRH are functional homologues of yeast Rad5 that cooperatively mediate PCNA polyubiquitination and maintain genomic stability</scope> .</sentence>
