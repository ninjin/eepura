<sentence id="0">Structural and functional implications of phosphorylation and acetylation in the regulation of the AAA+ protein p97 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">p97 , also known as VCP ( valosin-containing protein ) , is a hexameric AAA+ ATPase that participates in a variety of cellular processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is believed that p97 mediates these processes through the binding of various adaptor proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Many factors govern adaptor binding and the regulatory mechanisms are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> yet well understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sites of phosphorylation and acetylation on p97 have been identified and such post-translational modifications <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be involved in regulating p97 function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Phosphorylation and , to a lesser extent , acetylation of p97 have been shown to modify its properties - for example , by modulating adaptor binding and directing subcellular localization .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These modifications have been implicated in a number of p97-mediated processes , including misfolded protein degradation , membrane fusion , and transcription factor activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This review describes the known phosphorylation and acetylation sites on p97 and discusses their <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> structural and functional implications</scope> .</sentence>
