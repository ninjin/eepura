<sentence id="0">Bre1 is required for Notch signaling and histone modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Notch signaling controls numerous cell fate decisions during animal development .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These typically involve a Notch-mediated switch in transcription of target genes , although the details of this molecular mechanism are poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we identify dBre1 as a nuclear component required cell autonomously for the expression of Notch target genes in Drosophila development .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">dBre1 affects the levels of Su(H) in imaginal disc cells , and it stimulates the Su(H)-mediated transcription of a Notch-specific reporter in transfected Drosophila cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Strikingly , dBre1 mutant clones show much reduced levels of methylated lysine 4 on histone 3 ( H3K4m ) , a chromatin mark that has been implicated in transcriptional activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , dBre1 is the functional homolog of yeast Bre1p , an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for the monoubiquitination of histone H2B and , indirectly , for H3K4 methylation .</sentence>
