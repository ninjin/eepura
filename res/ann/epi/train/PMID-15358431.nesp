<sentence id="0">Widespread activation of antibiotic biosynthesis by S-adenosylmethionine in streptomycetes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The effect of S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) on the production of various antibiotics was investigated to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> SAM-dependent methylation is required in biosynthetic pathways of antibiotics</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Pristinamycin II(B) and granaticin do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> require SAM-dependent methylation in their biosynthesis pathways</scope> , and production of these two antibiotics was increased about 2-fold when a low concentration ( 50 and 10 microM , respectively ) of SAM was treated ; in contrast , oleandomycin and avermectin B1a require SAM as a methyl donor in their biosynthesis , and production of these two antibiotics was increased 5-fold and 6-fold , depending on the SAM concentration within a certain range .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We also found that the transcription of a pathway-specific regulator , gra-ORF9 , was activated by exogenous SAM treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Production of oleandomycin and avermectin B1a was decreased by using a methyltransferase inhibitor , sinefungin , but the production levels of these antibiotics were restored to the control level by simultaneously adding SAM and sinefungin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , we have found a similar stimulatory effect of S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) , the methylation product of SAM , on antibiotic production in the four strains .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our results clearly demonstrate the widespread activation of antibiotic production using SAM in streptomycetes .</sentence>
