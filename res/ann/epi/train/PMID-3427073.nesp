<sentence id="1">Kinetic and equilibrium studies of the binding of modified beta-D-galactoside sugars to the lac repressor were carried out to generate thermodynamic data for protein-inducer interactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The energetic contributions of the galactosyl hydroxyl groups to binding were assessed by using a series of methyl deoxyfluoro-beta-D-galactosides .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The C-3 and C-6 hydroxyls contributed less than or equal to -2.3 and -1.7 +/- 0.3 kcal/mol to the binding free energy change , respectively , whereas the C-4 hydroxyl provided only a nominal contribution ( -0.1 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Favorable contributions to the total binding free energy change were observed for replacement of O-methyl by S-methyl at the beta-anomeric position and for S-methyl by S-isopropyl .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Negative delta H degrees values characteristic of protein-sugar complexes [ Quiocho , F. A. ( 1986 ) Annu . Rev. Biochem. 55 , 287-315 ] were observed for a series of beta-D-galactosides differing at the beta-glycosidic position .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A decrease in delta H degrees of approximately 6 kcal/mol upon replacement of the O-methyl substituent by S-methyl <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates</cue> a substantial increase in van der Waals ' interactions and/or hydrogen bonding in this region of the ligand binding site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The more favorable free energy change for the binding of the S-isopropyl vs S-methyl compound is due mainly to more positive entropic contributions , consistent with an increase in apolar interactions .</sentence>
