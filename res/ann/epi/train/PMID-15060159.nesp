<sentence id="0">Mbd1 is recruited to both methylated and nonmethylated CpGs via distinct DNA binding domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">MBD1 is a vertebrate methyl-CpG binding domain protein ( MBD ) that can bring about repression of methylated promoter DNA sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Like other MBD proteins , MBD1 localizes to nuclear foci that in mice are rich in methyl-CpG .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In methyl-CpG-deficient mouse cells , however , Mbd1 remains localized to heterochromatic foci whereas other MBD proteins become dispersed in the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We find that Mbd1a , a major mouse isoform , contains a CXXC domain ( CXXC-3 ) that binds specifically to nonmethylated CpG , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> an explanation for methylation-independent localization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transfection studies demonstrate that the CXXC-3 domain indeed targets nonmethylated CpG sites in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Repression of nonmethylated reporter genes depends on the CXXC-3 domain , whereas repression of methylated reporters requires the MBD .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> MBD1 can interpret the CpG dinucleotide as a repressive signal in vivo regardless of its methylation status</scope> .</sentence>
