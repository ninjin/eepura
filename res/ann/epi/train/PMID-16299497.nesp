<sentence id="0">Prevention of early flowering by expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C requires methylation of histone H3 K36 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Flowering represents a crucial transition from a vegetative to a reproductive phase of the plant life cycle .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Despite extensive studies , the molecular mechanisms controlling flowering remain elusive .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although <scope type="spec" id="0"> the enzymes involved are <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> , methylation of histone H3 K9 and K27 correlates with repression of FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) , an essential transcriptional repressor involved in flowering time control in Arabidopsis thaliana ; in contrast , methylation of H3K4 correlates with FLC activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that loss-of-function of SET DOMAIN GROUP 8 ( SDG 8 ) , which encodes a homologue of the yeast SET2 histone methyltransferase , results in reduced dimethylation of histone H3K36 , particularly in chromatin associated with the FLC promoter and the first intron , regions that contain essential cis-elements for transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">sdg8 mutants display reduced FLC expression and flower early , establishing SDG8-mediated H3K36 methylation as a novel epigenetic memory code required for FLC expression in preventing early flowering .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This is the first demonstrated role of H3K36 methylation in eukaryote development .</sentence>
