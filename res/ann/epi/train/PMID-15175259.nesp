<sentence id="1">The covalent modification of nucleosomal histones has emerged as a major determinant of chromatin structure and gene activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To understand the interplay between various histone modifications , including acetylation and methylation , we performed a genome-wide chromatin structure analysis in a higher eukaryote .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found a binary pattern of histone modifications among euchromatic genes , with active genes being hyperacetylated for H3 and H4 and hypermethylated at Lys 4 and Lys 79 of H3 , and inactive genes being hypomethylated and deacetylated at the same residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , the degree of modification correlates with the level of transcription , and modifications are largely restricted to transcribed regions , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that their regulation is tightly linked to polymerase activity</scope> .</sentence>
