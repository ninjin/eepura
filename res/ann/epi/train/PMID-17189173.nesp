<sentence id="0">Glycosylation variant analysis of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator produced in urea-cycle-enzyme-expressing Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) was produced in ornithine transcarbamoylase ( OTC ) cells by introducing the tPA gene into OTC cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">OTC cells were originally derived from Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells and express the first two enzymes of the urea cycle , carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I ( CPS I ) and OTC .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate glycosylation variants , tPA variants produced in serum-supplemented culture medium of OTC-tPA cells were separated by lysine-Sepharose 4B chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Unlike in previous studies that used lysine-Sepharose chromatography , two peaks were identified to correspond to eluted glycosylation variants type I and II and type II and the percentages of the type I and type II variants were found to be 23 % and 77 % , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The biological activities of the type I and II and type II variants were twofold that of the Third International tPA Standard ( 98/714 ) produced in the CHO cell line , and the activity of type II variant was 12.6 % higher than that of the type I and II variants .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results demonstrate that tPA produced in urea-cycle-enzyme-producing OTC cells have a very high biological activity and the percentage of type II variant which is very valuable for the biopharmaceutical industry is higher than that of any report using CHO cells .</sentence>
