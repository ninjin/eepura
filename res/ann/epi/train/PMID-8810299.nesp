<sentence id="0">The related molecular chaperones calnexin and calreticulin differentially associate with nascent T cell antigen receptor proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Assembly of the multisubunit T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) complex is an intricate process requiring coordinated regulation of at least six different gene products ( alpha , beta , gamma , delta , epsilon , and zeta ) and the ordered pairing of partner chains within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To date , two proteins have been implicated as functioning as molecular chaperones in the assembly of nascent TCR proteins : calnexin , a resident ER transmembrane protein , which associates with all TCR components except zeta , and T cell receptor-associated protein , which selectively associates with CD3gammaepsilon pairs .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we examined the association of calreticulin , a soluble protein with significant sequence homology to calnexin , with newly synthesized TCR proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analogous to calnexin , processing of glycan chains by glucosidase enzymes was required for initial association of TCRalpha and -beta proteins with calreticulin ; however , several major differences were noted regarding interaction of calnexin and calreticulin chaperones with TCR proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">First , TCRalpha and -beta proteins showed prolonged association with calnexin molecules compared with calreticulin ; interaction of TCRalpha proteins with calreticulin was particularly transient , with most calreticulin-TCRalpha protein complexes dissociating within 15 min of their initial assembly .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Second , we found that , unlike calnexin , which associated with clonotypic TCRalpha and -beta proteins and invariant CD3delta and -epsilon polypeptides , calreticulin associated specifically with clonotypic TCRalpha and -beta proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These studies identify calreticulin as a molecular chaperone for nascent clonotypic TCRalpha and -beta proteins and demonstrate that calreticulin and calnexin differentially associate with newly synthesized TCR proteins within the ER .</sentence>
