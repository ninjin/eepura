<sentence id="0">The antigenic structure of the HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 establishes persistent infections in humans which lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins , gp120 and gp41 , are assembled into a trimeric complex that mediates virus entry into target cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">HIV-1 entry depends on the sequential interaction of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein with the receptors on the cell , CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The gp120 glycoprotein , which can be shed from the envelope complex , elicits both virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies during natural infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Antibodies that <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> neutralizing activity</scope> are often directed against the gp120 regions that are occluded on the assembled trimer and which are exposed only upon shedding .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Neutralizing antibodies , by contrast , must access the functional envelope glycoprotein complex and typically recognize conserved or variable epitopes near the receptor-binding regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Here we describe the spatial organization of conserved neutralization epitopes on gp120 , using epitope maps in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex that includes a gp120 core , CD4 and a neutralizing antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A large fraction of the predicted accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer is composed of variable , heavily glycosylated core and loop structures that surround the receptor-binding regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Understanding the structural basis for the ability of HIV-1 to evade the humoral immune response <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> assist in the design of a vaccine</scope> .</sentence>
