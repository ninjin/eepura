<sentence id="1">Methylation of histones at specific residues plays an important role in transcriptional regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Chromatin immunoprecipitation of dimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 across 53 kilobases of the chicken beta-globin locus during erythropoiesis shows an almost complete anticorrelation between regions of elevated lysine 9 methylation and acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Lysine 9 is methylated most over constitutive condensed chromatin and developmentally inactive globin genes .</sentence>
