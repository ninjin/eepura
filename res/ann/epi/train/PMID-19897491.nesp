<sentence id="3">This study examines a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> role for acetylation in the regulation of FoxA chromatin binding and remodeling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using in silico analysis , we have identified 11 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> p300 acetylation sites within FoxA1 , five of which</scope> are located within wings 1 and 2 of its winged-helix DNA-binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These polypeptide structures stabilize FoxA DNA and chromatin binding , and we have demonstrated that acetylation attenuates FoxA binding to DNA and diminishes its ability to remodel chromatin .</sentence>
