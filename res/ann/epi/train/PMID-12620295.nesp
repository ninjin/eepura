<sentence id="0">Preclinical evaluation of antineoplastic activity of inhibitors of DNA methylation ( 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ) and histone deacetylation ( trichostatin A , depsipeptide ) in combination against myeloid leukemic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">During the development of leukemia , genes that suppress growth and induce differentiation can be silenced by aberrant DNA methylation and by changes in chromatin structure that involve histone deacetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has been reported that a positive interaction between DNA methylation and histone deacetylation takes place to inhibit transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Based on this observation , our working hypothesis was that a combination of inhibitors of these processes <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">should</cue> produce an enhancement of their antineoplastic activity on leukemic cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The cytosine nucleoside analog , 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5AZA ) , is a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation , which can activate tumor suppressor genes in leukemic cells that have been silenced by aberrant methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In clinical trials , 5AZA was demonstrated to be an active antileukemic agent .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDI ) can also activate gene expression in leukemic cell lines by producing changes in chromatin configuration , and show antineoplastic activity in preclinical studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In this report , we investigated the in vitro antineoplastic activity of 5AZA , alone and in combination with the HDI , trichostatin A ( TSA ) and depsipeptide ( FR901228 , depsi ) , on the human myeloid leukemic cell lines , HL-60 and KG1a .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The results showed that the combination of 5AZA with TSA or depsi produced a greater inhibition of growth and DNA synthesis and a greater loss of clonogenicity than either agent alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that 5AZA used in combination with HDI <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be an interesting chemotherapeutic regimen to investigate in patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is resistant to conventional chemotherapy</scope></scope> .</sentence>
