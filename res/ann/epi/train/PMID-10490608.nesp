<sentence id="0">Roles of cell division and gene transcription in the methylation of CpG islands .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">De novo methylation of CpG islands within the promoters of eukaryotic genes is often associated with their transcriptional repression , yet the methylation of CpG islands located downstream of promoters does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> block transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the kinetics of mRNA induction , demethylation , and remethylation of the p16 promoter and second-exon CpG islands in T24 cells after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) treatment to explore the relationship between CpG island methylation and gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The rates of remethylation of both CpG islands were associated with time but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> with the rate of cell division</scope> , and remethylation of the p16 exon 2 CpG island occurred at a higher rate than that of the p16 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also examined the relationship between the remethylation of coding sequence CpG islands and gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The kinetics of remethylation of the p16 exon 2 , PAX-6 exon 5 , c-ABL exon 11 , and MYF-3 exon 3 loci were examined following 5-Aza-CdR treatment because these genes contain exonic CpG islands which are hypermethylated in T24 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Remethylation occurred most rapidly in the p16 , PAX-6 , and c-ABL genes , shown to be transcribed prior to drug treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These regions also exhibited higher levels of remethylation in single-cell clones and subclones derived from 5-Aza-CdR-treated T24 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that de novo methylation is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle</scope> and that transcription through CpG islands does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> inhibit their remethylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
