<sentence id="0">Chromatin compaction at the mononucleosome level .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using a previously described FRET technique , we measured the distance between the ends of DNA fragments on which nucleosomes were reconstituted from recombinant and native histones .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This distance was analyzed in its dependence on the DNA fragment length , concentration of mono- and divalent counterions , presence of linker histone H1 , and histone modifications .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that the linker DNA arms do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> cross under all conditions studied</scope> but diverge slightly as they leave the histone core surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Histone H1 leads to a global approach of the linker DNA arms , confirming the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">notion</cue> of a " stem structure "</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Increasing salt concentration also leads to an approach of the linker DNAs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To study the effect of acetylation , we compared chemically acetylated recombinant histones with histones prepared from HeLa cells , characterizing the sites of acetylation by mass spectroscopy .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Nucleosomes from chemically acetylated histones have few modifications in the core domain and form nucleosomes normally .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Acetylating all histones or selectively only H3 causes an opening of the nucleosome structure , indicated by the larger distances between the linker DNA ends .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Selective acetylation of H4 distances the linker ends for short fragments but causes them to approach each other for fragments longer than 180 bp .</sentence>
