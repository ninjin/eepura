<sentence id="0">Parkin , PINK1 , and DJ-1 form a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex promoting unfolded protein degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mutations in PARKIN , pten-induced putative kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) , and DJ-1 are individually linked to autosomal recessive early-onset familial forms of Parkinson disease ( PD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although mutations in these genes lead to the same disease state , the functional relationships between them and how their respective disease-associated mutations cause PD are largely unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that Parkin , PINK1 , and DJ-1 formed a complex ( termed PPD complex ) to promote ubiquitination and degradation of Parkin substrates , including Parkin itself and Synphilin-1 in neuroblastoma cells and human brain lysates .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Genetic ablation of either Pink1 or Dj-1 resulted in reduced ubiquitination of endogenous Parkin as well as decreased degradation and increased accumulation of aberrantly expressed Parkin substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expression of PINK1 enhanced Parkin-mediated degradation of heat shock-induced misfolded protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , PD-pathogenic Parkin and PINK1 mutations showed reduced ability to promote degradation of Parkin substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This study identified a functional ubiquitin E3 ligase complex consisting of PD-associated Parkin , PINK1 , and DJ-1 to promote degradation of un-/misfolded proteins and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that their PD-pathogenic mutations impair E3 ligase activity of the complex , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> constitute a mechanism underlying PD pathogenesis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
