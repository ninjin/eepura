<sentence id="0">Benzyl-alpha-GalNAc inhibits sialylation of O-glycosidic sugar chains on CD44 and enhances experimental metastatic capacity in B16BL6 melanoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We examined the effect of benzyl-alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine ( benzyl-alpha-GalNAc ) , which specifically inhibits the synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides , on the expression of the peanut agglutinin (PNA)-binding sugar chains ( Gal beta 1-3GalNAc ) of CD44 and on its experimental metastatic ability in B16BL6 melanoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Benzyl-alpha-GalNAc increased the PNA-binding , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> Concanavalin A ( Con A )</scope> , wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) , and leukoagglutinating phytohemaagglutinin (L-PHA)-binding to the cell surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Benzyl-alpha-GalNAc markedly increased the PNA-binding to CD44 by decreasing the sialylation of these sugar chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The experimental metastatic ability of B16BL6 cells was enhanced in association with this modulation of the sugar chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that unsialylated Gal beta 1-3GalNAc sugar chains on the cell surface and/or CD44 are involved in the metastatic process of B16BL6 melanoma cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">On the other hand , <scope type="neg" id="2">the known functions of CD44 , such as adhesion to hyaluronate , fibronectin , collagen , and endothelial cells , as well as homotypic aggregation , were <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected by benzyl-alpha-GalNAc regardless of the enhancement of metastatic ability induced by this glycosylation inhibitor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">CD44 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> have other metastasis related functions that remain to be elucidated</scope> .</sentence>
