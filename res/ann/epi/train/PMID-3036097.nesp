<sentence id="0">The role of insulin in the modulation of glucagon-dependent control of phenylalanine hydroxylation in isolated liver cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The stimulation of phenylalanine hydroxylation in isolated liver cells by sub-maximally effective concentrations of glucagon ( less than 0.1 microM ) is antagonized by insulin ( 0.1 nM-0.1 microM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This phenomenon is a consequence of a decrease in the glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation of phenylalanine hydroxylase from liver cells incubated in the presence of insulin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The impact of insulin on the phosphorylation state and activity of the hydroxylase is mimicked by incubation of liver cells in the presence of orthovanadate ( 10 microM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A series of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP analogues enhanced phenylalanine hydroxylation : in each case insulin diminished the stimulation of flux .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results are discussed in the light of the characteristics of insulin action on other metabolic processes .</sentence>
