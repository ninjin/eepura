<sentence id="0">Alpha4 is an essential regulator of PP2A phosphatase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The activity and specificity of serine/threonine phosphatases are governed largely by their associated proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">alpha4 is an evolutionarily conserved noncatalytic subunit for PP2A-like phosphatases .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Though alpha4 binds to only a minority of PP2A-related catalytic subunits , alpha4 deletion leads to progressive loss of all PP2A , PP4 , and PP6 phosphatase complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In healthy cells , association with alpha4 renders catalytic ( C ) subunits enzymatically inactive while protecting them from proteasomal degradation until they are assembled into a functional phosphatase complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">During cellular stress , existing PP2A complexes can become unstable .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Under such conditions , alpha4 sequesters released C subunits and is required for the adaptive increase in targeted PP2A activity that can dephosphorylate stress-induced phosphorylated substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with this , overexpression of alpha4 protects cells from a variety of stress stimuli , including DNA damage and nutrient limitation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings demonstrate that alpha4 plays a required role in regulating the assembly and maintenance of adaptive PP2A phosphatase complexes .</sentence>
