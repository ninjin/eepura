<sentence id="0">Cotranscription of two genes necessary for ribosomal protein L11 methylation ( prmA ) and pantothenate transport ( panF ) in Escherichia coli K-12 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Genetic complementation and enzyme assays have shown that the DNA region between panF , which encodes pantothenate permease , and orf1 , the first gene of the fis operon , encodes prmA , the genetic determinant for the ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Sequencing of this region identified one long open reading frame that encodes a protein of 31,830 Da and corresponds to the prmA gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found , both in vivo and in vitro , that prmA is expressed from promoters located upstream of panF and thus that the panF and prmA genes constitute a bifunctional operon .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We located the major 3' end of prmA transcripts 90 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon of prmA in the DNA region upstream of the fis operon , a region implicated in the control of the expression of the fis operon .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> promoter activity was detected immediately upstream of prmA , S1 mapping detected 5' ends of mRNA in this region</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">implying</cue> that some mRNA processing occurs within the bicistronic panF-prmA mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
