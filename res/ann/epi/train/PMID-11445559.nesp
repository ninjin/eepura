<sentence id="0">Linking global histone acetylation to the transcription enhancement of X-chromosomal genes in Drosophila males .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It has become well established for several genes that targeting of histone acetylation to promoters is required for the activation of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In contrast , global patterns of acetylation have <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been ascribed to any particular regulatory function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In Drosophila , a specific modification of H4 , acetylation at lysine 16 , is enriched at hundreds of sites on the male X chromosome due to the activity of the male-specific lethal ( MSL ) dosage compensation complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation , we have determined that H4Ac16 is present along the entire length of X-linked genes targeted by the MSL complex with relatively modest levels of acetylation at the promoter regions and high levels in the middle and/or 3' end of the transcription units .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> that global acetylation by the MSL complex increases the expression of X-linked genes by facilitating transcription elongation <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> by enhancing promoter accessibility</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have also determined that H4Ac16 is absent from a region of the X chromosome that includes a gene known to be dosage-compensated by a MSL-independent mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This study represents the first biochemical interpretation of the very large body of cytological observations on the chromosomal distribution of the MSL complex .</sentence>
