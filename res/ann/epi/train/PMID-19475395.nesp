<sentence id="1">Cell cycle transitions are controlled , in part , by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In mitosis , the metaphase to anaphase transition is governed by an E3 ubiquitin ligase called the cyclosome or Anaphase-Promoting Complex ( APC ) , and a WD40-repeat protein co-factor called Cdc20 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In vitro Cdc20-dependent APC ( APC(Cdc20) ) assays have been useful in the identification and validation of target substrates , and in the study of APC enzymology and regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Many aspects of the regulation of cell cycle progression have been discovered in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and proteins purified from this model organism have been employed in a wide variety of in vitro assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we outline a quantitative in vitro mitotic APC(Cdc20) assay that makes use of a highly active form of the APC that is purified from budding yeast cells arrested in mitosis .</sentence>
