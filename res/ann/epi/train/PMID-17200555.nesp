<sentence id="0">An in vivo assay to quantify stable protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) heterotrimeric species .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) regulates a broad spectrum of cellular processes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The enzyme is , in fact , largely a collection of varied heterotrimeric species composed of a catalytic ( C ) subunit and regulatory ( B-type ) subunit bound together by a structural ( A ) subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">One important feature of the C subunit is that its carboxy-terminus can be modified by phosphorylation and methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The mechanisms that trigger such posttranslational modifications , as well as their consequences , are still under investigation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , data collected thus far <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> these modifications alter the binding to B subunits for an AC dimer , thereby affecting the makeup of the PP2A species in the cell</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In this chapter , we describe an in vivo assay for assessing stable PP2A heterotrimer formation that is based on specific subcellular localizations of PP2A heterotrimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This assay can be used to study the impact of a wide variety of alterations ( such as mutations and covalent modifications ) on PP2A heterotrimer formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We specifically describe the use of this assay to quantify the effects of methylation on the stable formation of PP2ARts1p and PP2ACdc55p heterotrimers .</sentence>
