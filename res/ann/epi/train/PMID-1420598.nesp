<sentence id="0">Glycosylation of the interleukin-1 receptor type I is required for optimal binding of interleukin-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The two types of cell surface receptors for interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) are glycoproteins that contain N-glycosidic chains on their extracellular portions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine the role of glycosylation of the IL-1 receptor type I ( IL-1RtI ) in the binding and function of IL-1 , we used four plant lectins and glycosidase treatment on two different T-cell lines ( EL4-6.1 and D10S ) and expressing high number of binding sites for IL-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The lectins wheat germ agglutinin , phytohemagglutinin , and concanavalin A inhibited in a dose-response manner the IL-1-induced proliferation of D10S cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Binding of IL-1 was blocked and radioactive IL-1 was displaced from these cells by these lectins .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Specific sugars ( GlcNAc , NeuAc , Gal-GlcNAc-Man , Man , or alpha-MeMan ) did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> themselves affect IL-1 binding</scope> but reversed the blocking effects of the lectins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The two cell lines differed in their responses to the lectin-mediated inhibition of IL-1 binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Digestion by N-glycosidase significantly decreased the capacity of cells to bind IL-1 , and reduced by approximately 20,000 D the M(r) of the IL-1RtI .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Neuraminidase and O-glycanase treatment did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> alter the binding of IL-1 to D10S or EL4-6.1 cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This study demonstrates that glycosylation of the extracellular domain of the IL-1RtI is due to N-linked carbohydrates , that the degree of glycosylation can vary in cells of different lineage , and that <scope type="spec" id="2"> this N-linked glycosylation <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to be essential for optimal binding and activity of IL-1 to its type I receptor</scope> .</sentence>
