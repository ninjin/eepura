<sentence id="0">Mechanism of hypoxia-induced GCM1 degradation : implications for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Preeclampsia is a major pregnancy-specific disorder affecting 5-7 % of pregnancies worldwide .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although <scope type="spec" id="0"> hypoxia caused by incomplete trophoblast invasion and impaired spiral arterial remodeling is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be a major cause of preeclampsia</scope> , how hypoxia affects placental development remains uncertain .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">GCM1 ( glial cells missing homolog 1 ) is a transcription factor critical for placental development .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In preeclampsia , GCM1 and its target genes syncytin 1 and placental growth factor , important for syncytiotrophoblast formation and placental vasculogenesis , are all decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we present evidence that GCM1 is a major target of hypoxia associated with preeclampsia .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that hypoxia triggers GCM1 degradation by suppressing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway , leading to GSK-3beta activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Activated GSK-3beta phosphorylates GCM1 on Ser322 , which in turn recruits the F-box protein FBW2 , leading to GCM1 ubiquitination and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Importantly , the GSK-3beta inhibitor LiCl prevented hypoxia-induced GCM1 degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our study identifies a molecular basis for the disrupted GCM1 transcription network in preeclampsia and provides a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention .</sentence>
