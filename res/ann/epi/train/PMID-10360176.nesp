<sentence id="0">Novel roles for classical factors at the interface between translation termination and initiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The pathway of bacterial ribosome recycling following translation termination has remained obscure .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we elucidate two essential steps and describe the roles played by the three translation factors EF-G , RRF , and IF3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Release factor RF3 is known to catalyze the dissociation of RF1 or RF2 from ribosomes after polypeptide release .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that the next step is dissociation of 50S subunits from the 70S posttermination complex and that it is catalyzed by RRF and EF-G and requires GTP hydrolysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Removal of deacylated tRNA from the resulting 30S:mRNA:tRNA posttermination complex is then necessary to permit rapid 30S subunit recycling .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show that this step requires initiation factor IF3 , whose role was previously <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to be restricted to promoting specific 30S initiation complex formation from free 30S subunits</scope> .</sentence>
