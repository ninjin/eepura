<sentence id="0">PCNA mono-ubiquitination and activation of translesion DNA polymerases by DNA polymerase { alpha } .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Translesion DNA synthesis ( TLS ) involves PCNA mono-ubiquitination and TLS DNA polymerases ( pols ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recent evidence has shown that the mono-ubiquitination is induced <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> only by DNA damage but also by other factors that induce stalling of the DNA replication fork</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We studied the effect of spontaneous DNA replication errors on PCNA mono-ubiquitination and TLS induction .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the pol1L868F strain , which expressed an error-prone pol alpha , PCNA was spontaneously mono-ubiquitinated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Pol alpha L868F had a rate-limiting step at the extension from mismatched primer termini .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Electron microscopic observation showed the accumulation of a single-stranded region at the DNA replication fork in yeast cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">For pol alpha errors , pol zeta participated in a generation of +1 frameshifts .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , in the pol1L868F strain , UV-induced mutations were lower than in the wild-type and a pol delta mutant strain ( pol3-5DV ) , and deletion of the RAD30 gene ( pol eta ) suppressed this defect .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that nucleotide misincorporation by pol alpha induces exposure of single-stranded DNA , PCNA mono-ubiquitination and activates TLS pols</scope> .</sentence>
