<sentence id="0">Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) induces the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 to facilitate NEMO binding and the activation of IkappaBalpha kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) has been reported to stimulate the polyubiquitination and disappearance of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 ( IRAK1 ) within minutes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> that the polyubiquitin chains attached to IRAK1 are linked via Lys48 of ubiquitin , leading to its destruction by the proteasome and explaining the rapid IL-1-induced disappearance of IRAK1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this paper , we demonstrate that IL-1 stimulates the formation of K63-pUb-IRAK1 and not K48-pUb-IRAK1 and that the IL-1-induced disappearance of IRAK1 is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> blocked by inhibition of the proteasome</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also show that IL-1 triggers the interaction of K63-pUb-IRAK1 with NEMO , a regulatory subunit of the IkappaBalpha kinase ( IKK ) complex , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> with the NEMO[D311N ] mutant that cannot bind K63-pUb chains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , unlike wild-type NEMO , the NEMO[D311N ] mutant was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">unable</cue> to restore IL-1-stimulated NF-kappaB-dependent gene transcription to NEMO-deficient cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> a model in which the recruitment of the NEMO-IKK complex to K63-pUb-IRAK1 and the recruitment of the TAK1 complex to TRAF6 facilitate the TAK1-catalyzed activation of IKK by the TRAF6-IRAK1 complex</scope> .</sentence>
