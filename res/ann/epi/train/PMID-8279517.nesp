<sentence id="0">Characterization of the beta-subunit of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase using an inhibitory monoclonal antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The gastric proton pump , H(+)-K(+)-ATPase , is composed of alpha- and beta-subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The 95-kDa alpha-subunit has been referred to as the catalytic subunit containing sites for ATP binding and phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The beta-subunit is a glycoprotein with a 34-kDa core peptide that has a single transmembrane segment , a small cytoplasmic NH2-terminal , and a large extracellular COOH-terminal domain with seven <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> N-linked glycosylation sites</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To further study the beta-subunit , we developed monoclonal antibodies that identified a 52-kDa mannose-rich glycoprotein that was deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H such that six transient intermediates were identified , as well as a 34-kDa beta-subunit core peptide .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These observations <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the beta-subunit is synthesized as a 52-kDa glycoprotein with seven N-linked precursor high-mannose oligosaccharides that mature into complex oligosaccharides</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">One antibody , 2G11 , inhibits the K(+)-stimulated ATP hydrolysis as well as K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase ( pNPPase ) activity of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Kinetic studies revealed that 2G11 inhibited maximum velocity ( Vmax ) of ATP hydrolysis by approximately 50 % with <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> change in the Km for K+</scope> , whereas , for pNPPase both Vmax and Km were altered .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These studies demonstrate a functional role for the beta-subunit in the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity , especially the K(+)-induced conformational states .</sentence>
