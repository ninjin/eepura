<sentence id="0">COP1-mediated ubiquitination of CONSTANS is implicated in cryptochrome regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In Arabidopsis thaliana , the blue light photoreceptor cryptochromes ( CRY ) act to promote photomorphogenic development and the transition from vegetative to floral development in long days ( LDs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">proposed</cue> that one of the mechanisms by which CRY regulates light responses is via its physical interaction with COP1 , a RING motif-containing E3 ligase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Under LDs , the transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) is activated by CONSTANS ( CO ) in leaf , and the FT protein moves to the shoot apex to induce flowering .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">CO protein is degraded in darkness , whereas it is stabilized by the CRY-mediated signal .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the mechanism underlying this process is unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We show in this report that CO acts genetically downstream of COP1 and CRY to regulate flowering time .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , COP1 physically interacts with CO and functions as an E3 ligase , ubiquitinating CO in vitro and reducing CO levels in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that COP1 acts as a repressor of flowering by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of CO in darkness and that CRY-mediated signal <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> negatively regulate COP1 , thereby stabilizing CO , activating FT transcription , and inducing flowering</scope></scope> .</sentence>
