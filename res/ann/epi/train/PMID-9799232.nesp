<sentence id="0">CpG-DNA-specific activation of antigen-presenting cells requires stress kinase activity and is preceded by non-specific endocytosis and endosomal maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA , plasmid DNA and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG ODN ) activate dendritic cells ( DC ) and macrophages in a CD40-CD40 ligand-independent fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To understand the molecular mechanisms involved we focused on the cellular uptake of CpG ODN , the need for endosomal maturation and the role of the stress kinase pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we demonstrate that CpG-DNA induces phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase kinase 1 ( JNKK1/SEK/MKK4 ) and subsequent activation of the stress kinases JNK1/2 and p38 in murine macrophages and dendritic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This leads to activation of the transcription factor activating protein-1 ( AP-1 ) via phosphorylation of its constituents c-Jun and ATF2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , stress kinase activation is essential for CpG-DNA-induced cytokine release of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) and interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , as inhibition of p38 results in severe impairment of this biological response .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We further demonstrate that cellular uptake via endocytosis and subsequent endosomal maturation is essential for signalling , since competition by non-CpG-DNA or compounds blocking endosomal maturation such as chloroquine or bafilomycin A prevent all aspects of cellular activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that endosomal maturation is required for translation of intraendosomal CpG ODN sequences into signalling via the stress kinase pathway , where p38 kinase activation represents an essential step in CpG-ODN-triggered activation of antigen-presenting cells</scope> .</sentence>
