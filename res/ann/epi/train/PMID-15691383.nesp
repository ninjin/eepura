<sentence id="0"><scope type="neg" id="0">The loss of NKX3.1 expression in testicular--and prostate--cancers is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> caused by promoter hypermethylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Recent studies have demonstrated that the NKX3.1 protein is commonly down-regulated in testicular germ cell tumors ( TGCTs ) and prostate carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The homeobox gene NKX3.1 maps to chromosome band 8p21 , which is a region frequently lost in prostate cancer , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in TGCT</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Mutations have <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> been reported in the NKX3.1 sequence</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="3"> the gene is <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesized</cue> to be epigenetically inactivated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study we examined the methylation status of the NKX3.1 promoter in relevant primary tumors and cell lines : primary TGCTs ( n = 55 ) , intratubular germ cell neoplasias ( n = 7 ) , germ cell tumor cell lines ( n = 3 ) , primary prostate adenocarcinomas ( n = 20 ) , and prostate cancer cell lines ( n = 3 ) by methylation-specific PCR and bisulphite sequencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="4">RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : Down-regulation of NKX3.1 expression was generally <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> caused by promoter hypermethylation</scope> , which was only found in one TGCT .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , other epigenetic mechanisms , such as modulation of chromatin <scope type="spec" id="6"> structure <cue type="spec" id="6">or</cue> modifications of histones</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> explain the <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">lack</cue> of NKX3.1 expression</scope> , which is seen in most TGCTs and prostate cancer specimens</scope> .</sentence>
