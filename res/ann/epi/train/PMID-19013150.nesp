<sentence id="0">The trafficking and regulation of membrane receptors by the RING-CH ubiquitin E3 ligases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ubiquitylation of membrane receptors is recognised as a critical post-translational modification , governing their regulation and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Following ubiquitylation , <scope type="spec" id="0"> membrane proteins <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be internalised , recycled or degraded via lysosomal or proteasomal pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Viruses have appropriated these cellular pathways as a mechanism of immune evasion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RING ( really interesting new gene ) -CH ubiquitin E3 ligases were initially identified from the Kaposi 's associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) and their founding members , K3 and K5 , downregulate several critical immunoreceptors to prevent detection by the host immune system .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">K3 promotes formation of lysine-63 linked polyubiquitin chains on MHC Class I , signalling Class I internalisation and endolysosomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">K5 targets multiple immunoreceptors , including MHC Class I , CD86 , intracellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) 1 and MHC Class I-related chain (MIC)-A/B , thereby preventing detection from cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) and natural killer ( NK ) cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The cellular homologues of K3 and K5 , the Membrane Associated RING-CH ( MARCH ) genes , represent eleven proteins that also <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to be important in the downregulation of membrane receptors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">While overexpression of several MARCH genes downregulate cell surface receptors such as MHC Class I , MHC Class II , CD86 and ICAM 1 , determining their physiological roles has proved difficult .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Elucidating the transcriptional regulation , localisation and trafficking of MARCH genes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> provide insights into their cellular functions</scope> .</sentence>
