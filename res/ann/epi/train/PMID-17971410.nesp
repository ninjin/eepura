<sentence id="0">NCAM is ubiquitylated , endocytosed and recycled in neurons .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM plays an important role during neural development and in the adult brain .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To study the intracellular trafficking of NCAM in neurons , two major isoforms , NCAM140 or NCAM180 , were expressed in primary cortical neurons and in the rat B35 neuroblastoma cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">NCAM was endocytosed and subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane , whereas only a minor fraction was degraded in lysosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In cortical neurons , endocytosis of NCAM was detected in the soma , neurites and growth cones in a developmentally regulated fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , we found that NCAM is mono-ubiquitylated at the plasma membrane and endocytosis was significantly increased in cells overexpressing ubiquitin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that ubiquitylation represents an endocytosis signal for NCAM</scope> .</sentence>
