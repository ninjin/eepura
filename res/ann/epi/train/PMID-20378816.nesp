<sentence id="0">Arsenic trioxide controls the fate of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein by directly binding PML .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Arsenic , an ancient drug used in traditional Chinese medicine , has attracted worldwide interest because it shows substantial anticancer activity in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Arsenic trioxide ( As2O3 ) exerts its therapeutic effect by promoting degradation of an oncogenic protein that drives the growth of APL cells , PML-RARalpha ( a fusion protein containing sequences from the PML zinc finger protein and retinoic acid receptor alpha ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">PML and PML-RARalpha degradation is triggered by their SUMOylation , but <scope type="spec" id="0"> the mechanism by which As2O3 induces this posttranslational modification is <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that arsenic binds directly to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located within the RBCC domain of PML-RARalpha and PML .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Arsenic binding induces PML oligomerization , which increases its interaction with the small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme UBC9 , resulting in enhanced SUMOylation and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The identification of PML as a direct target of As2O3 provides new insights into the drug 's mechanism of action and its specificity for APL .</sentence>
