<sentence id="0">RBBP6 interacts with multifunctional protein YB-1 through its RING finger domain , leading to ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of YB-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">RBBP6 ( retinoblastoma binding protein 6 ) is a 250-kDa multifunctional protein that interacts with both p53 and pRb and has been implicated in mRNA processing .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has also been identified as a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> E3 ubiquitin ligase due to the presence of a RING finger domain</scope> , although no substrate has been identified up to now .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using the RING finger domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen , we identified YB-1 ( Y-box binding protein 1 ) as a binding partner of RBBP6 , localising the interaction to the last 62 residues of YB-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We showed , furthermore , that both full-length RBBP6 and the isolated RING finger domain were able to ubiquitinate YB-1 , resulting in its degradation in the proteosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">As a result , RBBP6 was able to suppress the levels of YB-1 in vivo and to reduce its transactivational ability .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the light of the important role that <scope type="spec" id="1"> YB-1 <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to play in tumourigenesis</scope> , our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that RBBP6 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be a relevant target for therapeutic drugs aimed at modifying the activity of YB-1</scope></scope> .</sentence>
