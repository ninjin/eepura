<sentence id="0">Monoclonal antibody-based screening assay for factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor ( FIH ) hydroxylates the asparagine 803 ( Asn803 ) residue of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) , and the modification abrogates the transcriptional activity of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because FIH is more active on HIF-1alpha than prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins under hypoxic conditions , its inhibitors have potential to be developed as anti-ischemic drugs targeting normal cells stressed by hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , the authors developed the first monoclonal antibody , SHN-HIF1alpha , specifically to Asn803 hydroxylated HIF-1alpha and a sensitive assay system for FIH inhibitors using the monoclonal antibody ( Mab ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">SHN-HIF1alpha showed 740 times higher affinity to the Asn803 hydroxylated HIF-1alpha peptide than the unmodified one .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based system using SHN-HIF1alpha displayed at least 30 times more sensitivity than previous methods for screening FIH inhibitors and was easily applicable to develop a high-throughput screening system .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">SHN-HIF1alpha also showed an Asn803 hydroxylation-dependent specificity to HIF-1alpha in cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , the results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that it <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be used to analyze the in vivo and in vitro activities of FIH inhibitors</scope></scope> .</sentence>
