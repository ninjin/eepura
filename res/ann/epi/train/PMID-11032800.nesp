<sentence id="1">The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are characterized by conversion of a host protein , PrP(C) ( cellular prion protein ) , to a protease-resistant isoform , PrP(Sc) ( prion protein scrapie isoform ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The importance of the highly flexible , N-terminal region of PrP has recently become more widely appreciated , particularly the biological activities associated with its metal ion-binding domain and its potential to form a poly(L-proline) II ( PPII ) helix .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Circular dichroism spectroscopy of an N-terminal peptide , PrP(37-53) , showed that the PPII helix is formed in aqueous buffer ; as it also contains an Xaa-Pro-Gly consensus sequence , it <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> act as a substrate for the collagen-modifying enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase</scope> .</sentence>
