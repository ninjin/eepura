<sentence id="0">Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , using a monoclonal antibody against alpha2-macroglobulin , for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVES : To develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using a monoclonal antibody ( mab ) directed against abnormally glycosylated serum alpha2-macroglobulin ( alpha2-M ) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">DESIGN AND METHODS : Serum alpha2-M purified by HPLC from patients with SLE was injected in a Balb/c , CB6 F1 female mouse and hybrid cell lines were screened using alpha2-M Glu-C fragments derived from SLE and normal donors ( NHS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A mab was selected and used to develop an ELISA by which sera from NHS ( n = 14 ) , SLE ( n = 34 ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( n = 15 ) , Sjogren 's syndrome ( n = 11 ) , mixed connective tissue diseases ( n = 12 ) , and liver diseases ( n = 11 ) were analyzed .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RESULTS : The affinity of the mab for alpha2-M from SLE , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> from the other diseases</scope> , was higher compared to NHS , as demonstrated by immunoblotting and ELISA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">CONCLUSIONS : The ELISA was capable of recognizing changes of glycosylation of alpha2-M in SLE and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be useful for its differential diagnosis</scope> .</sentence>
