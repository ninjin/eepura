<sentence id="0">Proteomics-based identification of novel factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor ( FIH ) substrates <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates</cue> widespread asparaginyl hydroxylation of ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Post-translational hydroxylation has been considered an unusual modification on intracellular proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , following the recognition that oxygen-sensitive prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation are central to the regulation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) , interest has centered on the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibility</cue> that these enzymes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> have other substrates in the proteome</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In support of this certain ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins , including members of the IkappaB and Notch families , have been identified as alternative substrates of the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although these findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">imply</cue> a <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">potentially</cue> broad</scope> range of substrates for FIH</scope> , the precise extent of this range has been difficult to determine because of the difficulty of capturing transient enzyme-substrate interactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we describe the use of pharmacological " substrate trapping " together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) technology to stabilize and identify potential FIH-substrate interactions by mass spectrometry .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To pursue these potential FIH substrates we used conventional data-directed tandem MS together with alternating low/high collision energy tandem MS to assign and quantitate hydroxylation at target asparaginyl residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Overall the work has defined 13 new FIH-dependent hydroxylation sites with a degenerate consensus corresponding to that of the ankyrin repeat and a range of ARD-containing proteins as actual and potential substrates for FIH .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Several ARD-containing proteins were multiply hydroxylated , and detailed studies of one , Tankyrase-2 , revealed eight sites that were differentially sensitive to FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> asparaginyl hydroxylation is <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">likely</cue> to be widespread among the approximately 300 ARD-containing species in the human proteome</scope></scope> .</sentence>
