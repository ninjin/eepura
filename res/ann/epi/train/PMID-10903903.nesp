<sentence id="0">Hsl7p , the yeast homologue of human JBP1 , is a protein methyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The yeast protein Hsl7p is a homologue of Janus kinase binding protein 1 , JBP1 , a newly characterized protein methyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this report , Hsl7p also is shown to be a methyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It can be crosslinked to [ ( 3)H]S-adenosylmethionine and exhibits in vitro protein methylation activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Calf histones H2A and H4 and bovine myelin basic protein were methylated by Hsl7p , whereas histones H1 , H2B , and H3 and bovine cytochrome c were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrated that JBP1 can complement Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a disrupted HSL7 gene as judged by a reduction of the elongated bud phenotype , and a point mutation in the JBP1 S-adenosylmethionine consensus binding sequence eliminated all complementation by JBP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , we conclude the yeast protein Hsl7p is a sequence and functional homologue of JBP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data provide evidence for an intricate link between protein methylation and macroscopic changes in yeast morphology .</sentence>
