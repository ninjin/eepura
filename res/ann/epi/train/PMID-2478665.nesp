<sentence id="0">Kinetics of carboxylmethylation of the charge isoforms of myelin basic protein by protein methyltransferase II .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The charge isoforms ( C1-C5 ) of bovine myelin basic protein ( MBP ) were used as substrates for the rat brain enzyme protein carboxylmethyltransferase ( PM II ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The objective of these experiments was to ascertain <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the kinetic behavior of the MBP isoforms reflected differences in the structures of this molecular family</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Initial velocity plots as a function of the MBP-isoform concentration showed significant differences ( p less than 0.05 ) among the assayed isoforms except for isoforms C2 and C4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Under the conditions of our experiment all the curves exhibited a consistent sigmoidicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The kinetic data were best fitted by a model , previously described for the enzyme D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase , in which two independent sites must be randomly occupied before any catalytic activity can occur .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This mechanism is substantially different from that proposed by other investigators for similar PM II enzymes and other substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The differences in the rates of isoform carboxylmethylation are largely accounted for by the different apparent dissociation constants Ks and is explained on the basis of inherent structural differences among the charge isoforms .</sentence>
