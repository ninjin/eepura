<sentence id="0">The Sts proteins target tyrosine phosphorylated , ubiquitinated proteins within TCR signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The T cell receptor ( TCR ) detects the presence of infectious pathogens and activates numerous intracellular signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Protein tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination serve as key regulatory mechanisms downstream of the TCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Negative regulation of TCR signaling pathways is important in controlling the immune response , and the Suppressor of TCR Signaling proteins ( Sts-1 and Sts-2 ) have been shown to function as critical negative regulators of TCR signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although their mechanism of action has yet to be fully uncovered , it is known that the Sts proteins possess intrinsic phosphatase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here , we demonstrate that Sts-1 and Sts-2 are instrumental in down-modulating proteins that are dually modified by both protein tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Specifically , both naive and activated T cells derived from genetically engineered mice that <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> the Sts proteins</scope> display strikingly elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylated , ubiquitinated proteins following TCR stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The accumulation of the dually modified proteins is transient , and in activated T cells but not naive T cells is significantly enhanced by co-receptor engagement .</sentence>
