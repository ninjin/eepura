<sentence id="3">We report here that the parkin Ubl binds SH3 domains from endocytic BAR proteins such as endophilin-A with an affinity comparable to proline-rich domains ( PRDs ) from well-established SH3 partners .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The NMR structure of the Ubl-SH3 complex identifies the PaRK extension , a unique C-terminal motif in the parkin Ubl required for SH3 binding and for parkin-mediated ubiquitination of endophilin-A in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In nerve terminals , conditions that promote phosphorylation enhance the interaction between parkin and endophilin-A and increase the levels of ubiquitinated proteins within PRD-associated synaptic protein complexes in wild-type but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> parkin knockout brain</scope> .</sentence>
