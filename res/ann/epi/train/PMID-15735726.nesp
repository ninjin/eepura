<sentence id="0">Analysis of methylation-sensitive transcriptome identifies GADD45a as a frequently methylated gene in breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Treatment of the breast cancer cell line , MDAMB468 with the DNA methylation inhibitor , 5-azacytidine ( 5-AzaC ) results in growth arrest , whereas the growth of the normal breast epithelial line DU99 ( telomerase immortalized ) is relatively unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Comparing gene expression profiles of these two lines after 5-AzaC treatment , we identified 36 genes that had relatively low basal levels in MDAMB468 cells compared to the DU99 line and were induced in the cancer cell line but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in the normal breast epithelial line</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Of these genes , 33 have associated CpG islands greater than 300 bp in length but only three have been previously described as targets for aberrant methylation in human cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Northern blotting for five of these genes ( alpha-Catenin , DTR , FYN , GADD45a , and Zyxin ) verified the array results .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further analysis of one of these genes , GADD45a , showed that 5-AzaC induced expression in five additional breast cancer cell lines with little or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> induction in three additional lines derived from normal breast epithelial cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The CpG island associated with GADD45a was analysed by bisulfite sequencing , sampling over 100 CpG dinucleotides .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We found that four CpG 's , located approximately 700 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site are methylated in the majority of breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in DNA from normal breast epithelia or matched lymphocytes from cancer patients</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , this simple method of dynamic transcriptional profiling yielded a series of novel methylation-sensitive genes in breast cancer including the BRCA1 and p53 responsive gene , GADD45a .</sentence>
