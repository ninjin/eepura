<sentence id="0">Histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 reactivates silenced estrogen receptor alpha ( ER ) gene expression without loss of DNA hypermethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Our previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) by trichostatin A reactivates estrogen receptor alpha ( ER ) gene expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we use the clinically relevant HDAC inhibitor , LBH589 ( LBH ) to explore the roles of HDAC in ER gene silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the ER-negative human breast cancer lines , MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 , treatment with LBH for 24 hours restored ER mRNA and protein expression without a concomitant demethylation of the CpG island at the ER promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The expression of ER mRNA was sustained at least 96 hours after withdrawal of LBH treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Restoration of ER expression by LBH enhanced 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The molecular mechanisms by which LBH reactivated silenced ER gene in MDA-MB-231 cells were examined with emphasis on chromatin structure reorganization .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">By chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis , LBH treatment released DNMT1 , HDAC1 , and the H3 lysine 9 ( H3-K9 ) methyltransferase SUV39H 1 from the ER promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Such changes were associated with an active chromatin formation manifested as accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 , a decrease in methylated H3-K9 , and an impaired binding of heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 alpha ) at the promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that HDAC inhibitors could restore expression of the silenced ER gene by reorganizing the heterochromatin-associated proteins without alteration in promoter DNA hypermethylation</scope> .</sentence>
