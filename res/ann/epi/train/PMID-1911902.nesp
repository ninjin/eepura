<sentence id="0">Methylation status of cKi-ras and MHC genes in rat pituitary glands during aging and tumorigenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation patterns of MHC ( major histocompatibility complex ) class I and vKi-ras ( viral Kirsten-ras ) homologous sequences in normal and adenomatous rat pituitary glands were studied as a function of age by Southern hybridization analysis using the isoschizomers Hpa II and Msp I. Both MHC class I and vKi-ras homologous sequences were found to be hypomethylated in a number of tumors , compared to normal pituitary gland tissue .</sentence>
