<sentence id="0">A Bre1-associated protein , large 1 ( Lge1 ) , promotes H2B ubiquitylation during the early stages of transcription elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcription activation has been proposed to require both ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of histone H2B .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that Lge1 ( Large 1 ) is found in a complex containing Rad6.Bre1 and that it controls the recruitment of Bre1 , a ubiquitin ligase , and Ubp8 , a deubiquitylase , to promote ubiquitylation during the early steps in elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Lge1 associates with promoter and coding regions of actively transcribed genes in a transcription-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Disruption of Lge1 abolished ubiquitylation of histone H2B on lysine 123 and H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 and resulted in significant sensitivity to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In particular , in Lge1-deficient cells , Bre1 recruitment was attenuated , whereas recruitment of Ubp8 was facilitated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These alterations were coincident with changes in the interaction between Bre1.Ubp8 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine 5 of the C-terminal domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that Lge1 has a novel function in disrupting the balance between the recruitment of Bre1 and Ubp8 , thus promoting transcription elongation</scope> .</sentence>
