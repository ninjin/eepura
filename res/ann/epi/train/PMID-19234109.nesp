<sentence id="0">Induction of SOX4 by DNA damage is critical for p53 stabilization and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">DNA damage response ( DDR ) acts as a tumorigenesis barrier , and any defects in the DDR machinery <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> lead to cancer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">SOX4 expression is elevated in many types of tumors ; however , its role in DDR is still largely unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we show that SOX4 , a new DNA damage sensor , is required for the activation of p53 tumor suppressor in response to DNA damage .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Notably , SOX4 interacts with and stabilizes p53 protein by blocking Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , SOX4 enhances p53 acetylation by interacting with p300/CBP and facilitating p300/CBP/p53 complex formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In concert with these results , SOX4 promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , and it inhibits tumorigenesis in a p53-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore , these findings highlight SOX4 as a potential key factor in regulating DDR-associated cancer .</sentence>
