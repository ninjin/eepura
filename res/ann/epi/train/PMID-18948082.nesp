<sentence id="0">Galphaq reduces cAMP production by decreasing Galphas protein abundance .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein Galphaq transduces signals from heptahelical transmembrane receptors ( e.g. , alpha(1)-adrenergic , endothelin 1A , and angiotensin II ) to stimulate generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , Galphaq decreases cAMP production , through <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> mechanisms</scope> , and thus affects physiological responsiveness of cardiac myocytes and other cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we provide evidence that Galphaq expression increases Galphas ubiquitination , decreases Galphas protein content , and impairs basal and beta(1)-adrenergic receptor-stimulated cAMP production .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These biochemical and functional changes are associated with Akt activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expression of constitutively active Akt also decreases Galphas protein content and inhibits basal and beta(1)-adrenergic receptor-stimulated cAMP production .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Akt knockdown inhibits Galphaq-induced reduction of Galphas protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , MDM2 , an E3 ubiquitin ligase , binds Galphas and promotes its degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Therefore , increased expression of Galphaq decreases cAMP production through Akt-mediated Galphas protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
