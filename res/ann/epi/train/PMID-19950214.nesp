<sentence id="0">PKB/Akt activation inhibits p53-mediated HIF1A degradation that is independent of MDM2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cross-talk between the two transcription factors , p53 and hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha ( HIF1A ) , is important in different pathophysiological conditions ( Hammond and Giaccia , 2006 , Clin Cancer Res 12:5007-5009 ) such as in the transition from myocardial hypertrophy to cardiac dilatation and heart <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failure</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In that context , p53 induces HIF1A degradation which in turn provokes the transition from compensatory hypertrophy to myocardial thinning and chamber dilatation ( Sano et al. , 2007 , Nature 446:444-448 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to investigate the mechanism of p53-induced HIF1A degradation , we used the established in vitro model of deferroxamine (DFX)-induced HIF1A accumulation in H9c2 cardiac cells ( Sano et al. , 2007 , Nature 446:444-448 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report that opposite to HIF1A accumulation following exposure to DFX , prolonged DFX-induced p53 activation and HIF1A protein decrease , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> any change in Hif1a mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">HIF1A protein decrease accompanied upregulated HIF1A ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">MDM2 , an ubiquitin E3 ligase target gene of p53 , was upregulated following prolonged DFX , but using p53/Mdm2 double-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts , we found that p53 upregulated HIF1A ubiquitination and degradation independently of MDM2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , with prolonged DFX treatment , an enhanced interaction between MDM2 and HIF1A was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacking</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Instead , phospho-Akt(ser473) was decreased during the phase coinciding with HIF1A degradation , and inhibition of PKB/Akt phosphorylation using PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002 ) upregulated HIF1A ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In summary , we <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">propose</cue> that p53-induced HIF1A degradation is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> exclusively MDM2-mediated</scope> , but reversible by PKB/Akt phosphorylation</scope> .</sentence>
