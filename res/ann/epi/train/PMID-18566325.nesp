<sentence id="0">Antibody fucosylation differentially impacts cytotoxicity mediated by NK and PMN effector cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glycosylation of the antibody Fc fragment is essential for Fc receptor-mediated activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Carbohydrate heterogeneity is known to modulate the activity of effector cells in the blood , in which fucosylation particularly affects NK cell-mediated killing .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we investigated how the glycosylation profile of 2F8 , a human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor in clinical development , impacted effector function .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Various 2F8 batches differing in fucosylation , galactosylation , and sialylation of the complex-type oligosaccharides in the Fc fragment were investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our results confirmed that low fucose levels enhance mononuclear cell-mediated antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , polymorphonuclear cells were found to preferentially kill via high-fucosylated antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Whole blood ADCC assays , containing both types of effector cells , revealed little differences in tumor cell killing between both batches .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Significantly , however , high-fucose antibody induced superior ADCC in blood from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-primed donors containing higher numbers of activated polymorphonuclear cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In conclusion , our data demonstrated for the first time that lack of fucose does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> generally increase the ADCC activity of therapeutic antibodies</scope> and that the impact of Fc glycosylation on ADCC is critically dependent on the recruited effector cell type .</sentence>
