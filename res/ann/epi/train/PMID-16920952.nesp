<sentence id="0">Human cytomegalovirus-encoded UL16 discriminates MIC molecules by their alpha2 domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human CMV infection results in MHC class I down-regulation and induction of NKG2D ligand expression favoring NK recognition of infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , human CMV-encoded UL16 counteracts surface expression of several NKG2D ligands by intracellular retention .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Interestingly , UL16 interacts with MICB , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> with the closely related MICA</scope> , and with UL16-binding proteins ( ULBP ) ULBP1 and ULBP2 , which are only distantly related to MICB , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> with ULPB3 or ULBP4</scope> , although all constitute ligands for NKG2D .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we dissected the molecular basis of MICA-MICB discrimination by UL16 to elucidate its puzzling binding behavior .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We report that the UL16-MICB interaction is independent of glycosylation and demonstrate that selective MICB recognition by UL16 is governed by helical structures of the MICB alpha2 domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transplantation of the MICB alpha2 domain confers UL16 binding capacity to MICA , and thus , <scope type="spec" id="2"> diversification of the MICA alpha2 domain <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> have been driven by the selective pressure exerted by UL16</scope> .</sentence>
