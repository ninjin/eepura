<sentence id="0">Posttranslational hydroxylation of ankyrin repeats in IkappaB proteins by the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) asparaginyl hydroxylase , factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Studies on hypoxia-sensitive pathways have revealed a series of Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases that regulate hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) by prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The recognition of these unprecedented signaling processes has led to a search for other substrates of the HIF hydroxylases .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that the human HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase , factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) , also efficiently hydroxylates specific asparaginyl (Asn)-residues within proteins of the IkappaB family .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After the identification of a series of ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins in a screen for proteins interacting with FIH , the ARDs of p105 ( NFKB1 ) and IkappaBalpha were shown to be efficiently hydroxylated by FIH at specific Asn residues in the hairpin loops linking particular ankyrin repeats .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The target Asn residue is highly conserved as part of the ankyrin consensus , and peptides derived from a diverse range of ARD-containing proteins supported FIH enzyme activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These findings demonstrate that <scope type="neg" id="0">this type of protein hydroxylation is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> restricted to HIF</scope> and strongly <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that FIH-dependent ARD hydroxylation is a common occurrence , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> providing an oxygen-sensitive signal to a diverse range of processes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
