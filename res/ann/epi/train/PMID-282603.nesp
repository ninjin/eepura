<sentence id="0">Displacement and aberrant methylation in vitro of H-1 histone in rat liver nuclei after half-saturation of chromatin with polycations .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Radiomethyl incorporation in vitro into Nepsilon-methyllysine of histones from rat liver nuclei incubated in the presence of S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine is stimulated if the polycations polylysines , protamines , or histones are added to the incubation mixture .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Maximal stimulation occurs at a cation/nucleotide ratio of 0.5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Past this point stimulation drops , except in the case of very lysine-rich histone H-1 , for which the maximal level of incorporation remains constant upon further addition of this histone .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography , differential precipitation , and gel electrophoresis of radiomethylated histones <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> although <scope type="neg" id="0">the usual incorporation of radiomethyl into histone H-3 is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affected</scope> , active methylation of H-1 occurs in the presence of polycations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Column chromatographic amino acid analysis reveals that the methylation of H-1 will specifically generate Nepsilon-monomethyllysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Except for this condition , H-1 is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">never</cue> methylated in vivo or in incubated cell nuclei</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Because H-1 is the weakest bound histone in chromatin , the above phenomena <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be explained by assuming that , within the chromatin , polycations displace the lysine-rich histone towards the nucleosome , which results in its abberant methylation</scope> , assuming that the native nucleosome is the seat of the histone lysine methyltransferase .</sentence>
