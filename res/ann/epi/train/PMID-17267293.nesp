<sentence id="0">Methylation of histone H3 lysine-79 by Dot1p plays multiple roles in the response to UV damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Various proteins have been found to play roles in both the repair of UV damaged DNA and heterochromatin-mediated silencing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In particular , factors that are involved in the methylation of lysine-79 of histone H3 by Dot1p have been implicated in both processes , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> a bipartite function for this modification</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We find that a dot1 null mutation and a histone H3 point mutation at lysine-79 cause increased sensitivity to UV radiation , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that lysine-79 methylation is important for efficient repair of UV damage</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Epistasis analysis between dot1 and various UV repair genes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates that</cue> lysine-79 methylation plays overlapping roles within the nucleotide excision , post-replication and recombination repair pathways , as well as RAD9-mediated checkpoint function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , epistasis analysis with the H3 lysine-79 point mutation <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicates that</cue> the lysine-to-glutamic acid substitution exerts specific effects within the nucleotide excision repair and post-replication repair pathways , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that this allele only disrupts a subset of the functions of lysine-79 methylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The overall results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate</cue> the existence of distinct and separable roles of histone H3 lysine-79 methylation in the response to UV damage , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">potentially</cue> serving to coordinate the various repair processes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
