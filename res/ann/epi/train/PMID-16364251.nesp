<sentence id="0">Transcriptional silencing of EphB6 receptor tyrosine kinase in invasive breast carcinoma cells and detection of methylated promoter by methylation specific PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The receptor tyrosine kinase EphB6 is expressed at reasonable levels in normal breast cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It shows decreased abundance in non-invasive breast carcinoma cells and is transcriptionally silenced in invasive breast carcinoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have characterized EphB6 promoter and correlated the expression of EphB6 transcript to differential methylation of the promoter region .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The demethylation of promoter sequence in vivo by growth in media containing 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restores the expression of EphB6 to normal levels in breast carcinoma cells , and the ability of the promoter to initiate transcription of a reporter gene is lost after methylation of the promoter sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The promoter region has binding sites for various factors such as SP1 and p300 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The specific methylation of CpG dinucleotides has allowed us to design primers that can selectively amplify the methylated promoter and thus facilitate identification of normal , non-invasive , and invasive breast cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The potential significance of EphB6 to serve as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator is discussed .</sentence>
