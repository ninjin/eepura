<sentence id="0">Defective ubiquitin-mediated degradation of antiapoptotic Bfl-1 predisposes to lymphoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bfl-1 is up-regulated in many human tumors in which nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is implicated and contributes significantly to tumor cell survival and chemoresistance .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously found that NF-kappaB induces transcription of bfl-1 and that the Bfl-1 protein is also regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the role that dysregulation of Bfl-1 turnover plays in cancer is <cue type="spec" id="0">not known</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that ubiquitination-resistant mutants of Bfl-1 display increased stability and greatly accelerated tumor formation in a mouse model of leukemia/lymphoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also show that tyrosine kinase Lck is up-regulated and activated in these tumors and leads to activation of the IkappaB kinase , Akt , and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signaling pathways , which are key mediators in cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Coexpression of Bfl-1 and constitutively active Lck promoted tumor formation , whereas Lck knockdown in tumor-derived cells suppressed leukemia/lymphomagenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data demonstrate that ubiquitination is a critical tumor suppression mechanism regulating Bfl-1 function and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that mutations in bfl-1 or in the signaling pathways that control its ubiquitination <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> predispose one to cancer</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , because bfl-1 is up-regulated in many human hematopoietic tumors , this finding <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> that strategies to promote Bfl-1 ubiquitination <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> improve therapy</scope></scope> .</sentence>
