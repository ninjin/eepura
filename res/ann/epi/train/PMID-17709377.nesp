<sentence id="0">T-cell ubiquitin ligand affects cell death through a functional interaction with apoptosis-inducing factor , a key factor of caspase-independent apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The lymphoid protein T-cell ubiquitin ligand (TULA)/suppressor of T-cell receptor signaling (Sts)-2 is associated with c-Cbl and ubiquitylated proteins and has been implicated in the regulation of signaling mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The results presented in this report <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> TULA facilitates T-cell apoptosis independent of either T-cell receptor/CD3-mediated signaling or caspase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Mass spectrometry-based analysis of protein-protein interactions of TULA demonstrates that TULA binds to the apoptosis-inducing protein AIF , which has previously been shown to function as a key factor of caspase-independent apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using RNA interference , we demonstrate that AIF is essential for the apoptotic effect of TULA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Analysis of the subcellular localization of TULA and AIF together with the functional analysis of TULA mutants is consistent with the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">idea</cue> that TULA enhances the apoptotic effect of AIF by facilitating the interactions of AIF with its apoptotic co-factors , which remain to be identified</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Overall , our results shed new light on the biological functions of TULA , a recently discovered protein , describing its role as one of very few known functional interactors of AIF .</sentence>
