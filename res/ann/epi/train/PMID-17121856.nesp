<sentence id="0">Site-specific acetylation of p53 directs selective transcription complex assembly .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors are being investigated as possible adjuvant therapies for a number of diseases , including cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition to stabilization of acetylated histones , HDAC inhibitors stabilize the acetylation of a number of transcription factors , including p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This study investigates the action of two HDAC inhibitors , CG-1521 and trichostatin A , which stabilize Ac-Lys-373 p53 and Ac-Lys-382 p53 , respectively , in LNCaP prostate cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Real-time PCR demonstrates that CG-1521 induces p21 transcription whereas trichostatin A does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> alter the steady state level of p21 mRNA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that the selective acetylation of p53 directs the recruitment of mutually exclusive coactivator complexes on the p53 response elements in the p21 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the co-activator complexes initiate the recruitment of the components of the basal transcription apparatus to the basal promoter with markedly different outcomes because only Ac-Lys-373 p53 promotes the assembly of the basal transcriptional apparatus on the p21 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data highlight the profound effects of post-translational modification , including acetylation , on the function of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The data also <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> a novel and critically important role for protein acetylation/deacetylation in the assembly of active transcription processes that <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be as important as classical phosphorylation/dephosphorylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
