<sentence id="0">Distinct dynamics and distribution of histone methyl-lysine derivatives in mouse development .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone methylation acts as an epigenetic regulator of chromatin activity through the modification of arginine and lysine residues on histones H3 and H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the case of lysine , this includes the formation of mono- , di- , or trimethyl groups , <scope type="spec" id="0"> each of which is <cue type="spec" id="0">presumed</cue> to represent a distinct functional state at the cellular level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To examine the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> developmental roles of these modifications</scope> , we determined the global patterns of lysine methylation involving K9 on histone H3 and K20 on histone H4 in midgestation mouse embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For each lysine target site , we observed distinct subnuclear distributions of the mono- and trimethyl versions in 10T1/2 cells that were conserved within primary cultures and within the 3D-tissue architecture of the embryo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , three of these modifications , histone H3 trimethyl K9 , histone H4 monomethyl K20 , and histone H4 trimethyl K20 exhibited marked differences in their distribution within the neuroepithelium .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Specifically , both histone H3 trimethyl K9 and H4 monomethyl K20 were elevated in proliferating cells of the neural tube , which in the case of the K9 modification was limited to mitotic cells on the luminal surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast , histone H4 trimethyl K20 was progressively lost from these medial regions and became enriched in differentiating neurons in the ventrolateral neural tube .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The inverse relationship of histone H4 K20 methyl derivatives is even more striking during skeletal and cardiac myogenesis where the accumulation of the trimethyl modification in pericentromeric heterochromatin <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> a role in gene silencing in postmitotic muscle cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Importantly , our results establish that histone lysine methylation occurs in a highly dynamic manner that is consistent with their function in an epigenetic program for cell division and differentiation .</sentence>
