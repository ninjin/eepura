<sentence id="1">Prolyl 4-hydroxylase , an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer , catalyses the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The beta subunit is known to be identical with the enzyme protein disulphide-isomerase and to possess disulphide-isomerase activity even when present in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We here report that lysyl hydroxylase , a homodimer , and algal prolyl 4-hydroxylase , a monomer , do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> contain detectable protein disulphide-isomerase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Since the hydroxylase reaction mechanisms are similar , the data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="3"> the protein disulphide-isomerase activity of the vertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta subunit is <cue type="spec" id="3">unlikely</cue> to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the hydroxylation reaction</scope></scope> .</sentence>
