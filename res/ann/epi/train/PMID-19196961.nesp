<sentence id="0">CHIP regulates leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 ubiquitination , degradation , and toxicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 ( LRRK2 ) is the most common cause of late-onset Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although most cases of PD are sporadic , some are inherited , including those caused by LRRK2 mutations .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Because <scope type="spec" id="0"> these mutations <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be associated with a toxic gain of function</scope> , controlling the expression of LRRK2 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> decrease its cytotoxicity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that the carboxyl terminus of HSP70-interacting protein ( CHIP ) binds , ubiquitinates , and promotes the ubiquitin proteasomal degradation of LRRK2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Overexpression of CHIP protects against and knockdown of CHIP exacerbates toxicity mediated by mutant LRRK2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , HSP90 forms a complex with LRRK2 , and inhibition of HSP90 chaperone activity by 17AAG leads to proteasomal degradation of LRRK2 , resulting in increased cell viability .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , increasing CHIP E3 ligase activity and blocking HSP90 chaperone activity can prevent the deleterious effects of LRRK2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings point to potential treatment options for LRRK2-associated PD .</sentence>
