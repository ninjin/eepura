<sentence id="0">Aberrant methylation of DAP-kinase in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Death-associated protein kinase ( DAP-kinase ) , a proapoptotic serine/threonine kinase , is a candidate tumor suppressor gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We studied the methylation status of DAP-kinase of 194 bone marrow samples from 160 patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and 34 with a myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) at the time of initial diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Hypermethylation of DAP-kinase was present in 27.5 % ( 44 of 160 ) of AML and in 47 % ( 16 of 34 ) of MDS specimens and significantly correlated to loss of DAP-kinase expression ( P = .008 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It was significantly more frequent in AML secondary to therapy for other malignancies ( s-AML ; 14 of 29 , 48.3 % ) , as compared to de novo AML ( 30 of 131 , 22.9 % , P = .01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">DAP-kinase hypermethylation in AML was associated with myelodysplastic changes in the bone marrow at the time of the initial diagnosis ( P = .002 ) and with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities ( P = .02 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Alteration in the apoptotic response due to the loss of DAP-kinase function <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be an early event in the transformation pathway to secondary leukemia via myelodysplasia</scope> .</sentence>
