<sentence id="0">In vitro differentiation of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In addition to long-term self-renewal capability , human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) possess versatile differentiation potential ranging from mesenchyme-related multipotency to neuroectodermal and endodermal competency .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Of particular concern is hepatogenic potential that can be used for liver-directed stem cell therapy and transplantation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we have investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived MSCs are also able to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">MSCs isolated from UCB were cultured under the pro-hepatogenic condition similar to that for bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Expression of a variety of hepatic lineage markers was analyzed by flow cytometry , RT-PCR , Western blot , and immunofluorescence .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The functionality of differentiated cells was assessed by their ability to incorporate DiI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein ( DiI-Ac-LDL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">As the cells were morphologically transformed into hepatocyte-like cells , they expressed Thy-1 , c-Kit , and Flt-3 at the cell surface , as well as albumin , alpha-fetoprotein , and cytokeratin-18 and 19 in the interior .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , about a half of the cells were found to acquire the capability to transport DiI-Ac-LDL .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Based on these observations , and taking into account immense advantages of UCB over other stem cell sources , we conclude that UCB-derived MSCs retain hepatogenic potential suitable for cell therapy and transplantation against intractable liver diseases .</sentence>
