<sentence id="0">Synergistic induction of nuclear factor-kappaB by transforming growth factor-beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha is mediated by protein kinase A-dependent RelA acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The TGF-beta ( transforming growth factor-beta ) pathway represents an important signalling pathway involved in regulating diverse biological processes , including cell proliferation , differentiation and inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Despite the critical role for TGF-beta in inflammatory responses , <scope type="spec" id="0"> its role in regulating NF-kappaB ( nuclear factor-kappaB ) -dependent inflammatory responses still remains <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study we show that TGF-beta1 synergizes with proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha ( tumour necrosis factor-alpha ) to induce NF-kappaB activation and the resultant inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TGF-beta1 synergistically enhances TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding activity via induction of RelA acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , synergistic enhancement of TNF-alpha-induced RelA acetylation and DNA-binding activity by TGF-beta1 is mediated by PKA ( protein kinase A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus the present study reveals a novel role for TGF-beta in inflammatory responses and provides new insight into the regulation of NF-kappaB by TGF-beta signalling .</sentence>
