<sentence id="0">Astrocyte- and hepatocyte-specific expression of genes from the distal serpin subcluster at 14q32.1 associates with tissue-specific chromatin structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The distal serpin subcluster contains genes encoding alpha1-antichymotrypsin ( ACT ) , protein C inhibitor ( PCI ) , kallistatin ( KAL ) and the KAL-like protein , which are expressed in hepatocytes , but only the act gene is expressed in astrocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show here that the tissue-specific expression of these genes associates with astrocyte- and hepatocyte-specific chromatin structures .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In hepatocytes , we identified 12 Dnase I-hypersensitive sites ( DHSs ) that were distributed throughout the entire subcluster , with the promoters of expressed genes accessible to restriction enzyme digestion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In astrocytes , only six DHSs were located exclusively in the 5' flanking region of the act gene , with its promoter also accessible to restriction enzyme digestion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The acetylation of histone H3 and H4 was found throughout the subcluster in both cell types but this acetylation did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> correlate with the expression pattern of these serpin genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Analysis of histone modifications at the promoters of the act and pci genes revealed that methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 correlated with their expression pattern in both cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , inhibition of methyltransferase activity resulted in suppression of ACT and PCI mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that lysine 4 methylation of histone H3 correlates with the tissue-specific expression pattern of these serpin genes</scope> .</sentence>
