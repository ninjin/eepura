<sentence id="0">Epigenetic switch from posttranscriptional to transcriptional silencing is correlated with promoter hypermethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Changes in the distribution of methylcytosine residues along a transgene locus of tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) in relation to the type of gene silencing were studied in parental plant leaves , calli , and regenerated plants derived thereof .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Parental-silenced HeLo1 ( hemizygous for locus 1 ) plants show posttranscriptional silencing of the residing nptII ( neomycin phosphotransferase II ) transgene and cytosine methylation restricted to the 3' end and center part of the transcribed region .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report that with an increasing number of cell cycles , DNA methylation changes gradually , and methylation is introduced into the promoter during cell culture and more slowly in vegetatively propagated plants .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After 24 months of callus in vitro cultivation , an epigenetic variant , designated locus 1E , was obtained in which cytosine methylation of symmetrical ( CG and CNG ) sites was almost complete within the 5' end of the nptII-transcribed region and the 35S promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Further , methylation of nonsymmetrical sites appeared de novo in the promoter , whereas this type of methylation was significantly reduced in the 3' end of the transcribed region when compared with locus 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The newly established epigenetic patterns were stably transmitted from calli into regenerated plants and their progeny .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The protein and steady-state RNA levels remained low in locus 1E , whereas with nuclear run-on assays , no detectable amounts of primary transcripts were found along the nptII gene , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the methylated promoter became inactivated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that a switch between posttranscriptional and transcriptional gene silencing <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> be a mechanism leading to irrevocable shut down of gene expression within a finite number of generations</scope></scope> .</sentence>
