<sentence id="0">Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation is mediated by Set1 and promotes maintenance of active chromatin states in fission yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 ( H3 Lys-4 ) or lysine 9 ( H3 Lys-9 ) is known to define active and silent chromosomal domains respectively from fission yeast to humans .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , in budding yeast , H3 Lys-4 methylation is also necessary for silent chromatin assembly at telomeres and ribosomal DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we demonstrate that deletion of set1 , which encodes a protein containing an RNA recognition motif at its amino terminus and a SET domain at the carboxy terminus , abolishes H3 Lys-4 methylation in fission yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Unlike in budding yeast , <scope type="neg" id="0">Set1-mediated H3 Lys-4 methylation is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for heterochromatin assembly at the silent mating-type region</scope> and centromeres in fission yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our analysis <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that H3 Lys-4 methylation is a stable histone modification present throughout the cell cycle , including mitosis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The loss of H3 Lys-4 methylation in set1Delta cells is correlated with a decrease in histone H3 acetylation levels , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a mechanistic link between H3 Lys-4 methylation and acetylation of the H3 tail</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that methylation of H3 Lys-4 primarily acts in the maintenance of transcriptionally poised euchromatic domains , and that this modification is dispensable for heterochromatin formation in fission yeast , which instead utilizes H3 Lys-9 methylation</scope> .</sentence>
