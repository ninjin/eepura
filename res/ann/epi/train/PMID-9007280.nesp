<sentence id="0">Analysis of the binding specificities of oligomannoside-binding proteins using methylated monosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The binding specificities of the closely related lectins from Canavalia ensiformis and Dioclea grandiflora were examined using specifically O-alkylated mono- and disaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Both lectins accept any substitution at the monosaccharide C2 hydroxyl group .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The binding energy of C2-alkylated ligands-concanavalin A complexes increases by 1 kcal mol-1 for the C2-O-ethyl ligand , while the binding energies of the corresponding complexes with the Dioclea lectin are identical .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both lectins accept methyl , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> ethyl</scope> , substitution of the C3 hydroxyl , in contrast to earlier reports .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The results are interpreted in terms of existing models of the concanavalin A binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">While the results are consistent with a model of the concanavalin A extended binding site that places the non-reducing terminus of all disaccharides in the monosaccharide binding site , they point to the dangers of interpreting the binding behavior of unnatural saccharide ligands on the basis of crystallographic data obtained with native ligands .</sentence>
