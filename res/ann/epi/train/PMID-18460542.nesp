<sentence id="0">Cooperation between EZH2 , NSPc1-mediated histone H2A ubiquitination and Dnmt1 in HOX gene silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An intricate interplay between DNA methylation and polycomb-mediated gene silencing has been highlighted recently .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we provided evidence that Nervous System Polycomb 1 ( NSPc1 ) , a BMI1 homologous polycomb protein , plays important roles in promoting H2A ubiquitination and cooperates with DNA methylation in HOX gene silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We showed that NSPc1 stimulates H2A ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro through direct interaction with both RING2 and H2A .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RT-PCR analysis revealed that loss of NSPc1 , EZH2 or DNA methyltransferase 1 ( Dnmt1 ) , or inhibition of DNA methylation in HeLa cells de-represses the expression of HOXA7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays demonstrated that NSPc1 , EZH2 and Dnmt1 bind to the promoter of HOXA7 , which is frequently hypermethylated in tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Knockdown of NSPc1 results in significant reduction of H2A ubiquitination and DNA demethylation as well as Dnmt1 dissociation in the HOXA7 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Meanwhile Dnmt1 deficiency affects NSPc1 recruitment and H2A ubiquitination , whereas on both cases EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation remains unaffected .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">When EZH2 was depleted , however , NSPc1 and Dnmt1 enrichment was abolished concomitant with local reduction of H3K27 trimethylation , H2A ubiquitination and DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> NSPc1-mediated H2A ubiquitination and DNA methylation , both being directed by EZH2 , are interdependent in long-term target gene silencing within cancer cells</scope> .</sentence>
