<sentence id="0">A methyltransferase-independent function for Rmt3 in ribosomal subunit homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rmt3 is a member of the protein-arginine methyltransferase ( PRMT ) family and is the homolog of human PRMT3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously characterized Rmt3 as a ribosomal protein methyltransferase based on the identification of the 40 S Rps2 ( ribosomal protein S2 ) as a substrate of Rmt3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">RMT3-null cells produce nonmethylated Rps2 and show mis-regulation of the 40 S/60 S ribosomal subunit ratio due to a small subunit deficit .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For this study , we have generated a series of RMT3 alleles that express various amino acid substitutions to characterize the functional domains of Rmt3 in Rps2 binding , Rps2 arginine methylation , and small ribosomal subunit production .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Notably , catalytically inactive versions of Rmt3 restored the ribosomal subunit imbalance detected in RMT3-null cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Consistent with a methyltransferase-independent function for Rmt3 in small ribosomal subunit production , the expression of an Rps2 variant in which the identified methylarginine residues were substituted with lysines showed normal levels of 40 S subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Importantly , substitutions within the zinc finger domain of Rmt3 that abolished Rps2 binding did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> rescue the 40 S ribosomal subunit deficit of RMT3-null cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the Rmt3-Rps2 interaction , <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> Rps2 methylation</scope> , is important for the function of Rmt3 in the regulation of small ribosomal subunit production</scope> .</sentence>
