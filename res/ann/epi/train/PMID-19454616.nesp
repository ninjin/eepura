<sentence id="0">Novel fucosylated biomarkers for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Changes in glycosylation , most notably fucosylation , have been associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this report , the levels of fucosylated kininogen ( Fc-Kin ) and fucosylated alpha-1-antitrypsin were analyzed individually and in combination with the currently used marker , alpha-fetoprotein , and a previously identified biomarker , Golgi protein 73 ( GP73 ) , for the ability to distinguish between a diagnosis of cirrhosis and HCC .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This analysis was done on serum from 113 patients with cirrhosis and 164 serum samples from patients with cirrhosis plus HCC .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The levels of Fc-Kin and fucosylated alpha-1-antitrypsin were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared with those with cirrhosis ( P < 0.0001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Greatest performance was achieved through the combination of Fc-Kin , alpha-fetoprotein , and GP73 , giving an optimal sensitivity of 95 % , a specificity of 70 % , and an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.94 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In conclusion , the altered glycosylation of serum glycoproteins can act as potential biomarkers of primary HCC when used independently or in combination with other markers of HCC .</sentence>
