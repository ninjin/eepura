<sentence id="0">Disorder of collagen metabolism in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta ( lethal type ) : increased degree of hydroxylation of lysine in collagen types I and III .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Types I , II and III collagen were isolated from calvarium , skin and cartilage from a patient with recessive lethal osteogenesis imperfecta .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">the distribution of the various collagen types was normal in all three tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The alpha-chains were purified by molecular sieve and ion-exchange chromatography and were found to differ from the corresponding alpha-chains of age-matched controls only in that the alpha 1(I) , alpha 2 and alpha 1(III) chains contained higher amounts of hydroxylysine with proportionally less lysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">alpha 1(II) was normal .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The excess hydroxylysine residues were all glycosylated in the case of alpha 1(I) chains , but only partly so for the alpha 2 chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Similar observations were made with collagen from fetuses at various stages of development .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In these fetuses , however , the increase in the degree of hydroxylation of lysine in alpha 1(I) , alpha 2 and alpha 1(III) varied with age , being highest in the youngest fetus .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Seen in the context of embryonic development , the collagen of the patient <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">would</cue> correspond to that of a fetus younger than 18 weeks</scope> , and one could <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">speculate</cue> that the defect seen in this patient is the result of a disturbed process of maturation of connective tissue</scope> .</sentence>
