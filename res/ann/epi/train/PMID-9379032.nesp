<sentence id="0">Alteration of glycosylation renders HIV sensitive to inactivation by normal human serum .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Retroviruses from various mammalian species , excluding humans , are effectively inactivated in normal human serum ( NHS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recent studies have shown that NHS inactivation of retroviruses occurs through natural Ab recognition of a terminal glycosidic moiety on the viral envelope that is acquired during replication in the host cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This carbohydrate structure ( the alpha-galactosyl epitope ) is expressed on the cells of most mammals , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">with the</cue> exception of humans and other Old World primates</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , NHS sensitivity of HIV was assessed following viral propagation in human cells that were manipulated to express the alpha-galactosyl epitope .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">HUT-78 cells were transduced with an exogenous alpha1-3-galactosyl transferase gene , which codes for the terminal glycosyl transferase responsible for generation of the alpha-galactosyl epitope .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The transduced HUT-78 cells expressed high levels of the alpha-galactosyl epitope on their membrane surface , rendering them sensitive to killing in NHS .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similarly , HIV passaged through these cells acquired the alpha-galactosyl epitope in association with the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and was also effectively inactivated in NHS .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Viral inactivation was abolished by the addition of a synthetic disaccharide that contains the alpha-galactosyl epitope , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> virolysis is mediated by anti-alpha-galactosyl natural Ab. These results demonstrate that , like other retroviruses bearing the alpha-galactosyl epitope , HIV modified to express this epitope is inactivated in NHS</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , these data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that expression of the alpha-galactosyl epitope on the surface of viruses <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> have implications in the interspecies transmission of such viruses to humans</scope></scope> .</sentence>
