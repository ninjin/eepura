<sentence id="1">Corticosteroids are by far the most effective treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Inflammation in asthma is characterized by the increased expression of multiple inflammatory genes , including those that encode cytokines , chemokines , adhesion molecules , and inflammatory enzymes and receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Increased expression of inflammatory genes is regulated by pro-inflammatory transcription factors , such as nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These bind to , and activate , co-activator molecules that then acetylate core histones resulting in elevated gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Corticosteroids reverse histone acetylation at the site of inflammatory gene transcription , either by direct binding of the activated glucocorticoid receptor to NF-kappa B-associated co-activators or by recruitment of histone deacetylases to the activated transcription complex .</sentence>
