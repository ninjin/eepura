<sentence id="0">Type XIII collagen forms homotrimers with three triple helical collagenous domains and its association into disulfide-bonded trimers is enhanced by prolyl 4-hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Type XIII collagen is a type II transmembrane protein predicted to consist of a short cytosolic domain , a single transmembrane domain , and three collagenous domains flanked by noncollagenous sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies on mRNAs <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> the structures of the collagenous domain closest to the cell membrane , COL1 , the adjacent noncollagenous domain , NC2 , and the C-terminal domains COL3 and NC4 are subject to alternative splicing</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to extend studies of type XIII collagen from cDNAs to the protein level we have produced it in insect cells by means of baculoviruses .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Type XIII collagen alpha chains were found to associate into disulfide-bonded trimers , and hydroxylation of proline residues dramatically enhanced this association .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This protein contains altogether eight cysteine residues , and interchain disulfide bonds could be located in the NC1 domain and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> at the junction of COL1 and NC2</scope> , while <scope type="spec" id="2"> the two cysteine residues in NC4 are <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to form intrachain bonds</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Pepsin and trypsin/chymotrypsin digestions <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> the type XIII collagen alpha chains form homotrimers whose three collagenous domains are in triple helical conformation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The thermal stabilities ( T(m) ) of the COL1 , COL2 , and COL3 domains were 38 , 49 and 40 degrees C , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The T(m) of the central collagenous domain is unusually high , which in the light of this domain being invariant in terms of alternative splicing <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> that the central portion of the molecule <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> have an important role in the stability of the molecule</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">All in all , most of the type XIII collagen ectodomain <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">appears</cue> to be present in triple helical conformation , which is in clear contrast to <scope type="spec" id="7"> the short <cue type="spec" id="7">or</cue></scope> highly interrupted triple helical domains of the other known collagenous transmembrane proteins</scope> .</sentence>
