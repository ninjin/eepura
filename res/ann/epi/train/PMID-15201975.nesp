<sentence id="0">Less frequent promoter hypermethylation of DLC-1 gene in primary breast cancers .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Absence or low expression of DLC-1 , a tumor suppressor gene , in breast cancers has been shown recently .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">LOH of 8p12-p22 , on which DLC-1 is located , is frequent in breast cancers , but <scope type="neg" id="0">the correlation between low expression of DLC-1 and LOH has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been confirmed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine the implication of aberrant methylation , one of the most frequent mechanisms of silencing the tumor suppressor or cancer-related genes , we examined the methylation status of DLC-1 promoter region in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The hypermethylation status was examined by MSP and 25 % of cell lines harbored a methylated allele .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The gene silencing by methylation was also confirmed by the re-expression of DLC-1 by the 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment in DLC-1 hypermethylated cell line .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">But the methylation of DLC-1 gene was less frequently shown in primary breast cancers ( 10 % ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that hypermethylation is responsible for silencing of DLC-1 gene in a limited portion of breast cancers</scope> .</sentence>
