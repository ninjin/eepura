<sentence id="0">Down-regulation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V induces ER stress by changing glycosylation and function of GLUT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V ( GnT-V ) is a key enzyme in the processing of N-glycans during synthesis of glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have reported that down-regulating GnT-V <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> induce endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ER stress ) in 7721 cells , a human hepatocarcinoma cell line</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In a search for mechanisms of ER stress , we found that there was a prominent decline of glucose uptake in antisense GnT-V transfectant , furthermore , a decrease of tri- or tetra-antannary sugar chain of glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , <scope type="neg" id="1">distribution of GLUT1 in antisense GnT-V transfectant was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Glucose deprivation has been known to activate ER stress in tumor cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , the data presented in this study <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> the glycosylation change and decrease of transport activity of GLUT1 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be one <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> mechanism of ER stress induced by down-regulating GnT-V</scope></scope></scope> , and GnT-V <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> contribute to the regulation of glucose uptake by modifying glycosylation of GLUT1 in some tumor cells</scope> .</sentence>
