<sentence id="0">Cyclosporin A slows collagen triple-helix formation in vivo : indirect evidence for a physiologic role of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase accelerates otherwise slow , rate-limiting isomerization steps during folding of proteins in vitro , but is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">not</cue> yet securely identified with any specific physiologic role</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase and the cyclosporin A (CsA)-binding protein cyclophilin are identical , and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug CsA in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To establish a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> physiologic role of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase</scope> , we have studied the folding of procollagen I in suspended chick embryo tendon fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Folding of procollagen I is slowed by CsA : the time needed for 50 % of the molecules to reach a completely helical confirmation is 8.5 min in the absence and 13.5 min in the presence of 5 microM CsA ; and the calculated products , k x K , of the rate constant ( k ) and the equilibrium constant ( K ) of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization are 2.10 and 1.30 s-1 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , folding of purified collagen III in vitro is unaffected by CsA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In cultured human fibroblasts , CsA caused posttranslational overmodification ( hydroxylation of lysine 32.1 versus 22.1 % ) and increased intracellular degradation ( 18.7 versus 12.5 % ) , and hence decreased production ( 10.2 versus 13.2 % of total protein synthesis ) of collagens I and III , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> procollagen folding is slowed by CsA also in human fibroblasts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We conclude that peptidyl-prolyl cis-transisomerase ( and hence cyclophilin ) accelerates protein folding in living cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , the CsA-induced changes in collagen metabolism are reminiscent of those observed in several variants of osteogenesis imperfecta caused by structural abnormalities in the pro-collagen chains which impair helix formation .</sentence>
