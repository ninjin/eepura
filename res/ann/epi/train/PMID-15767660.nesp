<sentence id="0">Relationship between histone H3 lysine 9 methylation , transcription repression , and heterochromatin protein 1 recruitment .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3-K9 ) methylation has been shown to correlate with transcriptional repression and serve as a specific binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study , we investigated the relationship between H3-K9 methylation , transcriptional repression , and HP1 recruitment by comparing the effects of tethering two H3-K9-specific histone methyltransferases , SUV39H1 and G9a , to chromatin on transcription and HP1 recruitment .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although both SUV39H1 and G9a induced H3-K9 methylation and repressed transcription , only SUV39H1 was able to recruit HP1 to chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Targeting HP1 to chromatin required not only K9 methylation but also a direct protein-protein interaction between SUV39H1 and HP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Targeting methyl-K9 or a HP1-interacting region of SUV39H1 alone to chromatin was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> sufficient to recruit HP1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also demonstrate that methyl-K9 can suppress transcription independently of HP1 through a mechanism involving histone deacetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In an effort to understand how H3-K9 methylation led to histone deacetylation in both H3 and H4 , we found that H3-K9 methylation inhibited histone acetylation by p300 but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> its association with chromatin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Collectively , these data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> H3-K9 methylation alone can suppress transcription but is insufficient for HP1 recruitment in the context of chromatin exemplifying the importance of chromatin-associated factors in reading the histone code</scope> .</sentence>
