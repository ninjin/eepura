<sentence id="3">The unglycosylated human protein was stable when expressed in bacteria or in Spodoptera frugiperda cells in the presence of tunicamycin but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacked</cue> catalytic activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Deglycosylation of purified acid beta-glucosidase from human placenta with N-Glycanase under native conditions resulted in the removal of an accessible oligosaccharide chain from a single site with <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect on activity</scope> , whereas complete deglycosylation resulted in proportionate loss of activity .</sentence>
