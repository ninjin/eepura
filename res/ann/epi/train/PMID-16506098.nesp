<sentence id="0">Heterochromatin assembly : a new twist on an old model .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The organization of eukaryotic genomes requires a harmony between efficient compaction and accessibility .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This is achieved through its packaging into chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Chromatin can be subdivided into two general structural and functional compartments : euchromatin and heterochromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Euchromatin comprises most of the expressed genome , while heterochromatin participates intimately in the production of structures such as centromeres and telomeres essential for chromosome function .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have begun to highlight the genetic pathways critical for the assembly and epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin , including key roles played by the RNAi machinery , H3 lysine 9 methylation and heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Recent studies have also identified a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase universally required for H3 K9 methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Here we outline these studies and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> several models for the role of this E3 ligase in heterochromatin assembly</scope> .</sentence>
