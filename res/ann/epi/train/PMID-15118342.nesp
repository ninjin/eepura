<sentence id="0">Transferrin microheterogeneity in fetal blood .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVES : To investigate the distribution of microheterogeneous subfractions of transferrin in fetal blood and the influence of highly sialylated transferrins on fetal growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">STUDY METHOD : Serum transferrin concentrations were determined by a standard turbidimetric assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Microheterogeneous transferrin subfractions were assessed by crossed immunoisoelectric focusing .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RESULTS : In normal term infants , total serum transferrin concentrations and percent distribution of highly sialylated transferrins ( > or = 5-sialo-transferrins ) were markedly lower ; the percent distributions of hyposialylated transferrins ( 0- and 1-sialo-transferrins ) were apparently higher than those in non-pregnant and pregnant women .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">There was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> significant positive correlation</scope> between the serum concentrations of total transferrin or highly sialylated transferrins in infants ' blood and birth weights ( r = 0.187 , p = 0.582 ; r = 0.374 , p = 0.257 , respectively ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CONCLUSION : The transferrin microheterogeneity pattern shifted towards reduced glycosylation and sialylation in addition to a decrease in total transferrin concentration in fetal blood compared to that of non-pregnant and pregnant women .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The concentrations of serum total transferrin and the highly sialylated transferrins in fetal blood , if higher than a certain level , did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">seem</cue> to have any influence on normal fetal growth</scope></scope> .</sentence>
