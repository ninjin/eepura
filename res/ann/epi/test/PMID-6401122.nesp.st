E1000	Speculation:T1000 Scope:T1001
T1001	Span 626 879	proposed that the beta-turn conformation at the Pro-Gly segments in the nascent procollagen molecule are the sites of the enzymatic hydroxylation and that this conformation changes over to the collagen-like helix as a result of the hydroxylation process
T1002	Speculation 298 311	indicate that
E1001	Speculation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 298 445	indicate that Hyp is necessary for the normal secretion of the protein after its synthesis and for the integrity of the triple-helical conformation
T1004	Speculation 1589 1596	believe
E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1589 1819	believe that our observations on proline hydroxylation in collagen should also be applicable to C1q and acetylcholineesterase both of which share the general structural and functional properties of collagen in their "tail" regions
T1006	Speculation 947 955	proposal
E1003	Speculation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 947 1385	proposal by a) synthesizing specific beta-turn oligopeptides containing the Pro-Gly as well as Pro-Ala and Pro-DAla sequences and showing that these act as inhibitors of the enzymatic hydroxylation of a synthetic substrate and b) demonstrating, by circular dichroism spectroscopy, the occurrence of a conformational change leading to the triple-helix as a direct consequence of proline hydroxylation in a non-helical polypeptide substrate
T1008	Speculation 1876 1882	should
E1004	Speculation:T1008 Scope:T1009
T1009	Span 1876 1996	should be able to assess the role of hydroxyproline in the folding, structural stabilities and functions of C1q and AChE
T1010	Speculation 1656 1662	should
E1005	Speculation:T1010 Scope:T1011
T1011	Span 1656 1819	should also be applicable to C1q and acetylcholineesterase both of which share the general structural and functional properties of collagen in their "tail" regions
T1012	Speculation 2106 2109	may
E1006	Speculation:T1012 Scope:T1013
T1013	Span 2106 2175	may share common structural features with their collagen counterparts

E1007	Speculation:T1014 Scope:T1015
T1015	Span 2003 2175	would also involve the study of the unhydroxylated and hydroxylated precursors of these proteins which may share common structural features with their collagen counterparts
