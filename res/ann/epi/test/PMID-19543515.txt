Differential methylation pattern of ID4, SFRP1, and SHP1 between acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. 
To gain insight into the differential mechanism of gene promoter hypermethylation in acute and chronic leukemia, we identified the methylation status on one part of 5'CpG rich region of 8 genes, DAB2IP, DLC-1, H-cadherin, ID4, Integrin alpha4, RUNX3, SFRP1, and SHP1 in bone marrows from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Also, we compared the methylation status of genes in AML and CML using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The frequencies of DNA methylation of ID4, SFRP1, and SHP1 were higher in AML patients compared to those in CML patients. In contrast, no statistical difference between AML and CML was detected for other genes such as DLC-1, DAB2IP, H-cadherin, Integrin alpha4, and RUNX3. Taken together, these results suggest that these methylation-controlled genes may have different roles in AML and CML, and thus, may act as a biological marker of AML.
