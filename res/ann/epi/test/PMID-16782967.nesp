<sentence id="0">Isolation and characterization of low sulfated heparan sulfate sequences with affinity for lipoprotein lipase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) , which is an important enzyme in lipid metabolism , binds to heparan sulfate ( HS ) proteoglycans .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This interaction is crucial for several aspects of LPL function , such as intracellular/extracellular transport and high capacity attachment to cell surfaces .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Retention of LPL on the capillary walls , and elsewhere , via HS chains is most <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> affected by the quality and quantity of HS present</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Earlier studies have demonstrated that LPL interacts with highly sulfated HS and heparin oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Since such structures are relatively rare in endothelial HS , we have re-addressed the question of physiological ligand structures for LPL by affinity purification of end-labeled oligosaccharides originating from heparin and HS on immobilized LPL .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By a combination of chemical modification and fragmentation of the bound material we identified that the bound fraction contained modestly sulfated oligosaccharides with an average sulfation of one O-sulfate per disaccharide unit and tolerates N-acetylated glucosamine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore LPL , containing several clusters of positive charges on each subunit , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> constitute an ideal structure for a protein that needs to bind with reasonable affinity to a variety of modestly sulfated sequences of the type that is abundant in HS chains</scope> .</sentence>
