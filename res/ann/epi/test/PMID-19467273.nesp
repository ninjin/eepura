<sentence id="0">Hepatitis C virus-core protein facilitates the degradation of Ku70 and reduces DNA-PK activity in hepatocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have established monoclonal antibodies ( MoAbs ) that are directed against hepatitis C virus (HCV)-expressing cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">They showed enhanced tumorigenicity after passage in culture for more than 44 days ( RzM6-44d cells ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To address the mechanism underlying this phenomenon , we characterized the MoAbs , and found that one of the clones recognized a molecule that was down-regulated in the RzM6-44d cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This molecule was purified and identified as the 70-kDa thyroid autoantigen Ku70 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , expression of the full-length HCV genome or HCV-core protein sequence in WRL68 human embryonic liver cells reduced the level of Ku70 protein , enhanced the ubiquitination of Ku70 , and decreased the activity of DNA-activated protein kinase ( DNA-PK ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , it <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> that the HCV-core protein facilitates the degradation of Ku70 and reduces DNA-PK activity in noncancerous liver cells</scope> .</sentence>
