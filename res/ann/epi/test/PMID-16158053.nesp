<sentence id="0">E2F-HDAC complexes negatively regulate the tumor suppressor gene ARHI in breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">ARHI is a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene whose expression is markedly downregulated in breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Reactivation of ARHI expression in breast cancer cells is associated with increased histone H3 acetylation and decreased lysine 9 methylation of histone H3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">An ARHI promoter segment that spanned bases -420 to +58 ( designated the P2 region ) exhibits significantly higher promoter activity in normal cells than in cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To better understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to this differential transcriptional activity , we sought to identify transcription factors that bind to the P2 region of the ARHI promoter and regulate its activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sequence analysis and oligonucleotide competition in electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified an A2 fragment containing an E2F-binding site .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using specific antibodies in supershift assays , we have shown that anti-E2F1 and 4 antibodies can supershift the A2-protein complexes , whereas anti-E2F2 and 6 antibodies cannot , demonstrating that the A2 fragment interacts with specific members of the E2F family proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">When compared with normal breast epithelial cells , breast cancer cells have significantly elevated expression of E2F1 , 4 and increased E2F DNA-binding activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both E2F1 and 4 bind to the ARHI promoter in breast cancer cells in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This binding was reduced when the cells were treated with the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor--trichostatin A ( TSA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">When SKBr3 cells were cotransfected with an ARHI/luciferase reporter and E2F-expression vectors , E2F1 and 4 reduced ARHI promoter activity 2-3-fold , and this reduction could be reversed by TSA treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The negative regulation by E2F-HDAC complexes <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> also be reduced by small interfering RNA of E2F1 and 4</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">While the retinoblastoma protein , pRB , alone had <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> effect on ARHI promoter activity</scope> , repression by E2F1 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> E2F4</scope> , was enhanced by the coexpression of pRB .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Taken together , our results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that E2F1 , 4 and their complexes with HDAC play an important role in downregulating the expression of the tumor suppressor gene ARHI in breast cancer cells</scope> .</sentence>
