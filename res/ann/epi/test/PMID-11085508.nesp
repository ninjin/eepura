<sentence id="0">Fluorescent methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for DNA-based detection of prostate cancer in bodily fluids .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Promoter hypermethylation of the glutathione S-transferase P1 gene ( GSTP1 ) is the most frequent DNA alteration in prostatic carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because this epigenetic DNA alteration can be reliably detected by methylation-specific PCR ( MSP ) , we applied this new technique for molecular detection of prostate cancer in various human bodily fluids .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We investigated GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation in DNA isolated from plasma , serum , ejaculate , and urine after prostate massage and from prostate carcinoma tissues from 33 patients with prostate cancer and 26 control patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Fluorescently labeled MSP products were analyzed on an automated gene sequencer .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Whereas GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> detectable by MSP in prostate tissue and bodily fluids from patients with BPH</scope> , we found it in 94 % of tumors ( 16 of 17 ) , 72 % of plasma or serum samples ( 23 of 32 ) , 50 % of ejaculate ( 4 of 8 ) and 36 % of urine ( 4 of 11 ) from patients with prostate cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , MSP identified circulating tumor cells in 30 % ( 10 of 33 ) of prostate cancer patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Analysis of GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation by MSP thus provides a specific tool for molecular diagnosis of prostate cancer in bodily fluids .</sentence>
