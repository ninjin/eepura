<sentence id="0">The effect of oxygen partial pressure on protein synthesis and collagen hydroxylation by mature periodontal tissues maintained in organ cultures .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mature periodontal tissues from adult-mouse first mandibular molars were cultured in a continuous-flow organ-culture system which allowed the regulation of both ascorbic acid concentration and pO(2) ( oxygen partial pressure ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Protein synthesis was measured by analysing the incorporation of [ ( 3)H]proline into collagenous and non-collagenous proteins during the last 24h of a 2-day culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">At low pO(2) [ 16.0kPa ( approx .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">120mmHg ) ] approx .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">60 % of protein-incorporated [ ( 3)H]proline was found in collagenous proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , it was evident that this collagen was considerably underhydroxylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">At high pO(2) [ 56.0kPa ( approx .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">420mmHg ) ] , both the amount of collagen deposited in the tissues and the degree of hydroxylation were increased considerably .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> significant effect on non-collagenous protein was observed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Tissues cultured at low pO(2) for the first 48h were <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">unable</cue> to respond to a subsequent increase in pO(2) during the last 24h</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Analysis of pepsin-solubilized collagen alpha-chains labelled with [ ( 14)C]glycine demonstrated the synthesis of both type-I and type-III collagens by explants cultured for 48h at high pO(2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Type-III collagen comprised 20-30 % of the radioactivity in alpha-chains in both the periodontal ligament and the tissues of the alveolar process .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The pattern of protein synthesis in the alveolar tissues at high pO(2) was similar to that observed in these tissues in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">However , in the cultured periodontal ligament the proportions of non-collagenous proteins and type-III collagens were increased in comparison with the tissue in vivo .</sentence>
