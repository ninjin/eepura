<sentence id="0">Acetylation of the HIV-1 Tat protein : an in vitro study .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In the last few years , the understanding of lysine acetylation as a regulatory post-translational modification of proteins in cell signalling cascades has increased .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is now known that not only histones but also non-histone factors can serve as substrates of different acetyltransferase enzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Acetylated lysine residues in non-histone factors are often identified using radioactive labelling experiments and immunochemical analysis of synthetic peptides .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat protein , we demonstrate the benefits of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry , proteolytic digestion and Edman sequencing for the mapping of acetylation sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We confirmed that the HIV-1 Tat protein is acetylated in vitro by the acetyltransferase p300 at a specific lysine residue at position 50 in its RNA binding region .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we showed that the Tat cysteine-rich region is acetylated at multiple cysteine residues in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of enzyme</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Since this non-enzymatic cysteine acetylation occurs independently from the surrounding peptide sequence , we consider the presence of cysteine residues in acetylated peptides an important factor for the interpretation of in vitro acetylation assays in general .</sentence>
