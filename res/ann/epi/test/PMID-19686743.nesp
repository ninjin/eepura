<sentence id="0">SKP2 and CKS1 promote degradation of cell cycle regulators and are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND & AIMS : The cell cycle regulators P21(WAF1) , P27(KIP1) , P57(KIP2) , P130 , RASSF1A , and FOXO1 are down-regulated during hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) pathogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the role of the ubiquitin ligase subunits CKS1 and SKP2 , which regulate proteasome degradation of cell cycle regulators , in HCC progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : Human HCC tissues from patients with better ( HCCB , > 3 years survival ) and poorer prognosis ( HCCP , < 3 years survival ) and HCC cell lines were analyzed .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RESULTS : The promoters of P21(WAF1) , P27(KIP1) , and P57(KIP2) were more frequently hypermethylated in HCCP than HCCB .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Messenger RNA levels of these genes were up-regulated in samples in which these genes were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> methylated</scope> ; protein levels increased only in HCCB because of CKS1- and SKP2-dependent ubiquitination of these proteins in HCCP .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The level of SKP2 expression correlated with rate of HCC cell proliferation and level of microvascularization of samples and was inversely correlated with apoptosis and survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In HCCB , SKP2 activity was balanced by degradation by the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-CDH1 and up-regulation of SKP2 suppressor histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 ( HINT1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In HCCP , however , <scope type="neg" id="1">SKP2 was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> degraded because of down-regulation of the phosphatase CDC14B , CDK2-dependent serine phosphorylation ( which inhibits interaction between CDH1 and SKP2 ) , and HINT1 inactivation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In HCC cells , small interfering RNA knockdown of SKP2 reduced proliferation and ubiquitination of the cell cycle regulators , whereas SKP2 increased proliferation and reduced expression of cell cycle regulators .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSIONS : Ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of P21WAF1 , P27KIP1 , P57KIP2 , P130 , RASSF1A , and FOXO1 and mechanisms that prevent degradation of SKP2 by APC/C-CDH1 contribute to HCC progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="11"><scope type="spec" id="2"> CKS1-SKP2 ligase <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> be developed as a therapeutic target or diagnostic marker</scope> .</sentence>
