<sentence id="0">HIV-1 acute infection env glycomutants designed from 3D model : effects on processing , antigenicity , and neutralization sensitivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) envelope protein ( Env ) has evolved to limit its overall immunogenicity by extensive glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Only a few studies dealing with glycosylation sites have taken into account available 3D data in a global approach .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We compared primary env sequences from patients with acute HIV-1 infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Conserved N-glycosylation sites were placed on the gp120-3D model .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Based on vicinity , we defined glycosylation clusters .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">According to these clusters , we engineered plasmids encoding deglycosylated gp160 mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also constructed mutants corresponding to nonclustered glycans or to the full deglycosylation of the V1 or V2 loop .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">After in vitro expression , mutants were tested for functionality .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We also compared the inhibition of pseudotyped particles infection by human-neutralizing sera .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Generally , clustered and nonclustered mutants were affected similarly .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Silencing of more than one glycan had deleterious effects , independently of the type of sugar removed .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">However , some mutants were moderately affected by glycans removal <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> a distinct role for these N-glycans</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Additionally , compared to the wild-type pseudovirus , two of these mutants were neutralized at higher sera dilutions strengthening the importance of the location of specific N-glycans in limiting the neutralizing response .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">These results could guide the selection of env mutants with the fewest antigenic and functional alterations but with enhanced neutralization sensitivity .</sentence>
