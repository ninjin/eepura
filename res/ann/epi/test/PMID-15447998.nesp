<sentence id="0">Value of p16INK4a and RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation in prognosis of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The p16INK4a and RASSF1A are tumor suppressor genes frequently inactivated by de novo promoter hypermethylation in non-small cell lung cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We studied 119 patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( 70 stage I/II and 49 stage IIIA ) who had undergone surgery with curative intent .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The p16INK4a and RASSF1A promoter methylation statuses were determined by methylation-specific PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Statistical analyses , all two-sided , were performed to determine the prognostic effect of hypermethylation on various clinical parameters .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hypermethylation of the p16INK4a and RASSF1A promoters was found in 58 ( 49 % ) and 46 ( 39 % ) tumors , respectively , and 30 tumors ( 25 % ) exhibited hypermethylation of both gene promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In patients with stage I/II tumors , only p16INK4a promoter hypermethylation was associated with a poor 5-year overall survival rate ( P=0.002 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In patients with stage IIIA disease , however , RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation was a stronger predictor of a poor 5-year overall survival rate ( P < 0.0001 ) than p16INK4a promoter hypermethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Among the 49 patients with stage IIIA tumors , 16 ( 89 % ) of the 18 patients whose tumors showed RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation died within 3 years after surgery , as compared with only 12 ( 39 % ) of the 31 patients whose tumors had no RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation ( P < 0.0001 ) .</sentence>
