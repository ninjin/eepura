<sentence id="1">The acetylation of specific lysine residues in the histone H4 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> play a role in regulating various genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ Grunstein ( 1990 ) Annu . Rev. Cell Biol. 6 , 643-678 ]</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The detailed consideration of this <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibility</cue> has been hampered by the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of information</scope> on the frequency with which different H4 lysine residues are acetylated in yeast</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this paper , we use Western blotting from acid/urea/Triton gels and immunostaining with antisera specific for H4 molecules acetylated at particular lysine residues to show that 70-80 % of H4 molecules in S. cerevisiae contain one or more acetylated lysines , and that lysines-5 , -8 , -12 and -16 are acetylated in an ordered , non-random fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The monoacetylated isoform ( H4Ac1 ) is acetylated predominantly at lysine-16 ( rarely at lysine-12 ) , H4Ac2 is acetylated at lysine-16 and at either lysine-12 or at -8 , while lysine-5 is acetylated frequently only in H4Ac3 and in H4Ac4 .</sentence>
