<sentence id="0">Epigenetic status and aberrant expression of the maspin gene in human hepato-biliary tract carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We examined expression of maspin and the epigenetic status of its gene in 40 primary hepato-biliary tract carcinomas and 11 cell lines originating from hepato-pancreatico-biliary tract carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Aberrant maspin expression was frequently observed immunohistochemically in biliary tract carcinomas ( 22/25 , 88 % ) but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCCs ) ( 0/15 , 0 %</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Aberrant maspin expression by five pancreatico-biliary tract carcinoma cell lines was closely associated with demethylation at the maspin promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Five of six HCC cell lines were maspin-negative and exhibited extensive hypomethylation and hypoacetylation at the maspin promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> activate maspin expression in these five maspin-negative HCC cell lines</scope> , whereas treatment with Trichostatin A ( TSA ) activated maspin expression in two of them .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Treatment with TSA increased histone acetylation in some HCC cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that aberrant maspin expression in biliary tract carcinomas is closely associated with demethylation at the promoter region , but that some HCC cell lines additionally require histone acetylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , the fact that maspin-negative HCC cell lines remain after treatment with TSA <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> the existence of other repressive factors controlling maspin expression</scope> .</sentence>
