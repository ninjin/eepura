<sentence id="0">Acetylation of TAF(I)68 , a subunit of TIF-IB/SL1 , activates RNA polymerase I transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mammalian rRNA genes are preceded by a terminator element that is recognized by the transcription termination factor TTF-I .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In exploring the functional significance of the promoter-proximal terminator , we found that TTF-I associates with the p300/CBP-associated factor PCAF , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that TTF-I <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> target histone acetyltransferase to the rDNA promoter</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We demonstrate that PCAF acetylates TAF(I)68 , the second largest subunit of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP)-containing factor TIF-IB/SL1 , and acetylation enhances binding of TAF(I)68 to the rDNA promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , PCAF stimulates RNA polymerase I ( Pol I ) transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistent with acetylation of TIF-IB/SL1 being required for rDNA transcription , the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase mSir2a deacetylates TAF(I)68 and represses Pol I transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results demonstrate that acetylation of the basal Pol I transcription machinery has functional consequences and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that reversible acetylation of TIF-IB/SL1 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be an effective means to regulate rDNA transcription in response to external signals</scope></scope> .</sentence>
