<sentence id="0">Transposable elements : targets for early nutritional effects on epigenetic gene regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Early nutrition affects adult metabolism in humans and other mammals , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> via persistent alterations in DNA methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">With viable yellow agouti ( A(vy) ) mice , which harbor a transposable element in the agouti gene , we tested the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that the metastable methylation status of specific transposable element insertion sites renders them epigenetically labile to early methyl donor nutrition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our results show that dietary methyl supplementation of a/a dams with extra folic acid , vitamin B(12) , choline , and betaine alter the phenotype of their A(vy)/a offspring via increased CpG methylation at the A(vy) locus and that the epigenetic metastability which confers this lability is due to the A(vy) transposable element .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that dietary supplementation , long presumed to be purely beneficial , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> have unintended deleterious influences on the establishment of epigenetic gene regulation in humans</scope></scope> .</sentence>
