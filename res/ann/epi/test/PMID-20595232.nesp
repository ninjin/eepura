<sentence id="0">Conserved role of SIRT1 orthologs in fasting-dependent inhibition of the lipid/cholesterol regulator SREBP .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP ) transcription factor family is a critical regulator of lipid and sterol homeostasis in eukaryotes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In mammals , SREBPs are highly active in the fed state to promote the expression of lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes and facilitate fat storage .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">During fasting , SREBP-dependent lipid/cholesterol synthesis is rapidly diminished in the mouse liver ; however , the mechanism has remained incompletely understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , the evolutionary conservation of fasting regulation of SREBP-dependent programs of gene expression and control of lipid homeostasis has been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We demonstrate here a conserved role for orthologs of the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 in metazoans in down-regulation of SREBP orthologs during fasting , resulting in inhibition of lipid synthesis and fat storage .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our data reveal that SIRT1 can directly deacetylate SREBP , and modulation of SIRT1 activity results in changes in SREBP ubiquitination , protein stability , and target gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , chemical activators of SIRT1 inhibit SREBP target gene expression in vitro and in vivo , correlating with decreased hepatic lipid and cholesterol levels and attenuated liver steatosis in diet-induced and genetically obese mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that SIRT1 orthologs play a critical role in controlling SREBP-dependent gene regulation governing lipid/cholesterol homeostasis in metazoans in response to fasting cues .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> have important biomedical implications for the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with aberrant lipid/cholesterol homeostasis , including metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis</scope> .</sentence>
