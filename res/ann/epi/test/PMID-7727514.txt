Enhanced tropoelastin-degrading activity during cell passages in cultured smooth muscle cells. 
Tropoelastin expression in vascular smooth muscle cells during serial cell passages from the primary to the tertiary culture was studied. The level of tropoelastin was found to be greatly reduced as the number of cell passages increased. The translational activity and level of elastin mRNA were essentially unchanged throughout the cell passages. The reduction in tropoelastin expression was not due to the repetitive trypsin treatment nor to the prolyl hydroxylation level of the newly-synthesized elastin. A comparable decline in tropoelastin expression was also found with increasing cell division in the primary cultures plated at different cell densities. A pulse-chase experiment revealed that the newly-synthesized elastin in the tertiary culture degraded more rapidly than that in the primary culture. The culture medium harvested from the tertiary culture exhibited a higher tropoelastin-degrading activity than that from the primary culture in the test-tube. The degrading activity of the tertiary culture was inhibited by the addition of 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, but not by 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that the reduction in tropoelastin expression during the cell passages from the primary to the tertiary culture is due to the enhanced tropoelastin-degrading activity of the tertiary culture. The transition to tropoelastin-degrading phenotype during cell passages may explain the biological mechanisms of smooth muscle cell migration from the media to the intima observed in the pathological conditions.
