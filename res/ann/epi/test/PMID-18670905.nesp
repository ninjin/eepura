<sentence id="0">Post-synthetic acetylation of HMGB1 protein modulates its interactions with supercoiled DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">High mobility group box ( HMGB ) proteins 1 and 2 are abundant non-histone nuclear proteins that regulate chromatin structure because of their structure-specific binding to DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we have investigated how the post-synthetic acetylation of HMGB1 affects its interaction with negatively supercoiled DNA by employing monoacetylated at Lys2 protein , isolated from butyrate-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our data reveal that this modification enhances three reaction parameters : binding affinity , supercoiling activity and capacity to protect the supercoiled DNA from relaxation by topoisomerase I .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that monoacetylation at Lys2 mimics the effect of acidic tail removal but to a lesser extent thus demonstrating that in vivo acetylated HMGB1 is capable of modulating its interaction with negatively supercoiled DNA .</sentence>
