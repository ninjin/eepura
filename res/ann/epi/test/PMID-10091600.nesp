<sentence id="2">Various human body fluids and secretions contain a soluble form of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) precursor .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The EGF precursor molecule contains eight EGF modules in addition to EGF itself .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using monoclonal antibodies specific for the EGF modules 7 and 8 , we have purified the soluble form of the EGF precursor from human urine to homogeneity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The protein was shown to have a molecular mass of about 160 kDa and the N-terminal sequence SAPNHWSXPE .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">EGF modules 2 , 7 and 8 of the precursor have the consensus sequence for post-translational beta-hydroxylation of Asp/Asn residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We identified the presence of erythro-beta-hydroxy-aspartic acid ( Hya ) in acid hydrolysates of the EGF precursor ( 2.4 M.M protein-1 ) .</sentence>
