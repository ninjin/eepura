T1001	Span 495 587	the mechanism by which the Sir protein binding is influenced by this modification is unclear
T1002	Speculation 296 305	suggested
E1001	Speculation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 296 484	suggested that H3K79 methylation within euchromatin prevents nonspecific binding of the Sir proteins, which in turn facilitates binding of the Sir proteins in unmethylated silent chromatin

E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1314 1497	suggest that the BAH domain of Sir3 binds to histone H3K79 and that acetylation of the BAH domain is required for the binding specificity of Sir3 for nucleosomes unmethylated at H3K79
