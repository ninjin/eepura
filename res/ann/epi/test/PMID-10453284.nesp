<sentence id="0">Epigenetic mechanisms for progression of prostate cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epigenetic mechanisms <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be the main driving force for critical changes in gene expression that are responsible for progression of prostate cancers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The three most extensively characterized mechanisms for epigenetic gene-regulation are ( i ) changing patterns of DNA methylation , ( ii ) histone acetylations/deacetylations , and ( iii ) alterations in regulatory feedback loops for growth factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Several studies have <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> DNA hypermethylation is an important mechanism in prostate cancer for inactivation of key regulatory genes such as E-cadherin , pi-class glutathione S-transferase , the tumor suppressors CDKN2 and PTEN , and IGF-II</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Similarly , histone acetylations and deacetylations are frequently associated respectively with transcriptional activation ( e.g. IGFBP-2 and p21 ) and repression ( e.g. Mad:Max dimers ) of genes linked to prostate cancer progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Recently , histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities have been shown to be intrinsic with transcriptional coregulator proteins that bind to steroid receptors ( e.g. SRC-1 and PCAF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Changes in regulatory feedback loops for growth factors with prostate cancer progression tend toward shifts from paracrine to autocrine control where the receptor and ligand are produced by the same cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">While there are several examples of this progression pattern in prostate tumors such as with IGF , FGF , TGF-alpha and their respective receptors , the precise mechanism ( i.e. epigenetic or mutational ) is less certain .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In the context of treatment options , the contribution of mutational versus epigenetic events to prostate cancer progression is an important consideration .</sentence>
<sentence id="9"><scope type="spec" id="2"> Irreversible genetic changes are <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> to be less amenable to therapeutic control than are epigenetic ones</scope> .</sentence>
