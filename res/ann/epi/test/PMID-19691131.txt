PTPIP51 mRNA and protein expression in tissue microarrays and promoter methylation of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate carcinoma. 
BACKGROUND: Protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) shows a tissue-specific expression pattern and is associated with cellular differentiation and apoptosis in several mammalian tissues. Overexpression of the full-length protein enhances apoptosis. It is also expressed in various carcinomas. In this study the expression of PTPIP51 and its in vitro interaction partners was investigated in human benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and in prostate carcinoma (PCa). METHODS: Tissue microarrays of human BPH and PCa were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. For polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cryo samples of BPH and PCa were used. Bisulfite DNA treatment, followed by sequencing of PCR products was performed in order to analyze CpGs methylation within the promoter region of the PTPIP51 gene. RESULTS: PTPIP51 mRNA and protein expression was detected in prostatic epithelia of BPH and in tumor cells of PCa, respectively, and within smooth muscle cells of the stromal compartment. A stronger expression was present in nerve fibers, particularly in PCa, in immune cells and in smooth muscle and endothelial cells of vessels of BPH and PCa. On mRNA levels, a slightly elevated expression of PTPIP51 was observed in the PCa group as tested by real-time quantitative PCR analyses. Methylation experiments revealed that at least 70% of methylated CpGs in the CpG island of the PTPIP51 gene promoter region were identified in BPH samples. In contrast, a loss of methylation has been found in the PCa group. CONCLUSION: The promoter methylation status of PTPIP51 seems to influence the expression of PTPIP51, which was seen as elevated in the PCa.
