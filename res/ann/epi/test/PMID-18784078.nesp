<sentence id="0">A C-terminal fragment of Cyclin E , generated by caspase-mediated cleavage , is degraded in the absence of a recognizable phosphodegron .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously shown that caspase-mediated cleavage of Cyclin E generates p18-Cyclin E in hematopoietic tumor cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Its expression can induce apoptosis or sensitize to apoptotic stimuli in many cell types .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , p18-cyclin E has a much shorter half-life than Cyclin E , being more effectively ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A two-step process has emerged that regulates accelerated degradation of Cyclin E , with a caspase-mediated cleavage followed by enhanced proteasome-mediated degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that recognition of p18-Cyclin E by the Skp1-Cul1-Fbw7 ( SCF ) complex and its interaction with the Fbw7 protein isoforms can take place independently of phosphorylation of p18-Cyclin E at a C-terminal phosphodegron .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition to the SCF(Fbw7) pathway , <scope type="spec" id="0"> Ku70 binding that facilitates Hdm2 recruitment <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> also be implicated in p18-Cyclin E ubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Blocking p18-Cyclin E degradation with proteasome inhibitors increases levels of p18-Cyclin E and enhances its association with Ku70 , thus leading to Bax release , its activation , and apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , cells expressing p18-Cyclin E are more sensitive to treatment with proteasome inhibitors , such as Bortezomib .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">By preventing its proteasomal degradation , p18-Cyclin E , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> Cyclin E</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> become an effective therapeutic target for Bortezomib and apoptotic effectors in hematopoietic malignancies</scope> .</sentence>
