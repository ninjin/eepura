<sentence id="0">Asparaginyl hydroxylation of the Notch ankyrin repeat domain by factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) are regulated by the post-translational hydroxylation of specific prolyl and asparaginyl residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show that the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase , factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) , also catalyzes hydroxylation of highly conserved asparaginyl residues within ankyrin repeat ( AR ) domains ( ARDs ) of endogenous Notch receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">AR hydroxylation decreases the extent of ARD binding to FIH while <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affecting signaling through the canonical Notch pathway</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">ARD proteins were found to efficiently compete with HIF for FIH-dependent hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Crystallographic analyses of the hydroxylated Notch ARD ( 2.35A ) and of Notch peptides bound to FIH ( 2.4-2.6A ) reveal the stereochemistry of hydroxylation on the AR and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">imply</cue> that significant conformational changes are required in the ARD fold in order to enable hydroxylation at the FIH active site</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> that ARD proteins function as natural inhibitors of FIH and that the hydroxylation status of these proteins provides another oxygen-dependent interface that modulates HIF signaling</scope> .</sentence>
