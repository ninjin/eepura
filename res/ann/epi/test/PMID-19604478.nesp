<sentence id="0">Structural basis for binding of hypoxia-inducible factor to the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylases .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of proline residues in the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ( HIFalpha ) is central to the hypoxic response in animals .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Prolyl hydroxylation of HIFalpha increases its binding to the von Hippel-Lindau protein ( pVHL ) , so signaling for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The HIF prolyl hydroxylases ( PHDs , prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes ) are related to the collagen prolyl hydroxylases , but form unusually stable complexes with their Fe(II) cofactor and 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of PHD2 , the most important of the human PHDs , in complex with the C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Together with biochemical analyses , the results reveal that PHD catalysis involves a mobile region that isolates the hydroxylation site and stabilizes the PHD2.Fe(II).2OG complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results will be of use in the design of PHD inhibitors aimed at treating anemia and ischemic disease .</sentence>
