<sentence id="0">Genetic or epigenetic silencing of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previously , we have reported frequent silencing of the expression of LRP1B by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As the same events <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> be involved in the development/progression of OSCC</scope> , we examined intragenic homozygous deletions , expression levels , and methylation status in the CpG island of this gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Homozygous deletion was detected in only 1 of 18 ( 5.6 % ) OSCC lines , whereas the expression of LRP1B mRNA was silenced in 8 of 17 ( 47.1 % ) OSCC lines without homozygous deletion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">An inverse correlation between mRNA expression and methylation status of the LRP1B CpG island was clearly observed in OSCC lines , and LRP1B mRNA expression was restored by treatment with 5-aza-dCyd .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Frequent methylation of the LRP1B promoter was also observed in primary OSCC .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Taken together , the results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that frequent inactivation of LRP1B mainly occurs by means of epigenetic mechanisms in OSCC , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> play an important role in oral tumorigenesis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
