<sentence id="0">Deubiquitylation of histone H2A activates transcriptional initiation via trans-histone cross-talk with H3K4 di- and trimethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transcriptional initiation is a key step in the control of mRNA synthesis and is intimately related to chromatin structure and histone modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that the ubiquitylation of H2A ( ubH2A ) correlates with silent chromatin and regulates transcriptional initiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The levels of ubH2A vary during hepatocyte regeneration , and based on microarray expression data from regenerating liver , we identified USP21 , a ubiquitin-specific protease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ubH2A .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When chromatin is assembled in vitro , ubH2A , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> H2A</scope> , specifically represses the di- and trimethylation of H3K4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">USP21 relieves this ubH2A-specific repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , in vitro transcription analysis revealed that ubH2A represses transcriptional initiation , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> transcriptional elongation</scope> , by inhibiting H3K4 methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Notably , <scope type="neg" id="2">ubH2A-mediated repression was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> observed when H3 Lys 4 was changed to arginine</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , overexpression of USP21 in the liver up-regulates a gene that is normally down-regulated during hepatocyte regeneration .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our studies revealed a novel mode of trans-histone cross-talk , in which H2A ubiquitylation controls the di- and trimethylation of H3K4 , resulting in regulation of transcriptional initiation .</sentence>
