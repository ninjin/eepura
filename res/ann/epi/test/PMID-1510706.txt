Inhibitory potency of some isatin analogues on human monoamine oxidase A and B. 
Isatin is an endogenous compound which acts as a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) B. In this study a range of isatin analogues were tested for their in vitro inhibition of human MAO A and B. Most of the analogues were less potent than isatin. Hydroxylation of the aromatic ring changed the inhibitory potency in favour of MAO A, with 5-hydroxyisatin being a potent and selective MAO A inhibitor (IC50 8 microM). Isatinic acid, which is formed reversibly from isatin at alkaline pH, showed no inhibition.
