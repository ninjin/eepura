<sentence id="0">Peroxynitrite as an alternative donor of oxygen in HIF-1alpha proline hydroxylation under low oxygen availability .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In the last years , nitric oxide ( NO ) mediated signaling became an integral component in understanding physiological and pathophysiological processes of cell proliferation , death or cellular adaptation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Among other activities , NO affects multiple targets that allow regulation of gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , NO was found to attenuate accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) under hypoxic conditions because of several mechanisms : redistribution of oxygen toward non-respiratory oxygen-dependent targets ( like HIF-1alpha proline hydroxylases--PHDs , which perform hydroxylation of Pro402/564 of HIF-1alpha leading to its proteasomal degradation ) ; in addition , peroxynitrite formed during interactions between NO and mitochondria derived superoxide leads to an increase in cytosolic iron/2-oxoglutarate ( 2-OG ) , which required for PHD activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that peroxynitrite , formed in the cells upon exposure to NO under low oxygen availability , serves as an alternative donor of oxygen for activated PHDs</scope></scope> so they can perform HIF-1alpha proline hydroxylation to de-accumulate the protein .</sentence>
