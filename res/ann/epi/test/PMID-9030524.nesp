<sentence id="0">5-Formyltetrahydrofolate regulates homocysteine remethylation in human neuroblastoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The metabolic role of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate is <cue type="spec" id="0">not</cue> known</scope> ; however , it is an inhibitor of several folate-dependent enzymes including serine hydroxymethyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase ( MTHFS ) is the only enzyme known to metabolize 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and catalyzes the conversion of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to address the function of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in mammalian cells , intracellular 5-formyltetrahydrofolate levels were depleted in human 5Y neuroblastoma by overexpressing the human cDNA encoding MTHFS ( 5YMTHFS cells ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">When cultured with 2 mM exogenous glycine , the intracellular serine and glycine concentrations in 5YMTHFS cells are elevated approximately 3-fold relative to 5Y cells ; 5YMTHFS cells do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> contain measurable levels of free methionine</scope> and display a 30-40 % decrease in cell proliferation rates compared with 5Y cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Medium supplemented with pharmacological levels of exogenous folinate or methionine ameliorated the glycine induced growth inhibition .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Analysis of the folate derivatives demonstrated that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate accounts for 30 % of total cellular folate in 5Y cells when cultured with 5 mM exogenous glycine .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">5YMTHFS cells do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> contain detectable levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate under the same culture conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that 5-formyltetrahydrofolate inhibits serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity in vivo and that serine synthesis and homocysteine remethylation compete for one-carbon units in the cytoplasm</scope> .</sentence>
