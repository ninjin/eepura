<sentence id="0">Jade-1 inhibits Wnt signalling by ubiquitylating beta-catenin and mediates Wnt pathway inhibition by pVHL .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The von Hippel-Lindau protein pVHL suppresses renal tumorigenesis in part by promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible HIF-alpha transcription factors ; <scope type="spec" id="0"> additional mechanisms have been <cue type="spec" id="0">proposed</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">pVHL also stabilizes the plant homeodomain protein Jade-1 , which is a candidate renal tumour suppressor that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> correlate with renal cancer risk</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that Jade-1 binds the oncoprotein beta-catenin in Wnt-responsive fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , Jade-1 destabilizes wild-type beta-catenin but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> a cancer-causing form of beta-catenin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Whereas the well-established beta-catenin E3 ubiquitin ligase component beta-TrCP ubiquitylates only phosphorylated beta-catenin , Jade-1 ubiquitylates both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated beta-catenin and therefore regulates canonical Wnt signalling in both Wnt-off and Wnt-on phases .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , the different characteristics of beta-TrCP and Jade-1 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> ensure optimal Wnt pathway regulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , pVHL downregulates beta-catenin in a Jade-1-dependent manner and inhibits Wnt signalling , supporting a role for Jade-1 and Wnt signalling in renal tumorigenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The pVHL tumour suppressor and the Wnt tumorigenesis pathway are therefore directly linked through Jade-1 .</sentence>
