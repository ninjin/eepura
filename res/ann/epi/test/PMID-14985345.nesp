<sentence id="0">Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers and dimers show identical decreases in Km values for peptide substrates with increasing chain length : mutation of one of the two catalytic sites in the tetramer inactivates the enzyme by more than half .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases ( collagen P4Hs , EC 1.14.11.2 ) play a key role in the synthesis of the extracellular matrix .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The vertebrate enzymes are alpha(2)beta(2) tetramers , the beta subunit being identical to protein disulfide isomerase ( PDI ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The main Caenorhabditis elegans collagen P4H form is an unusual PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI)(2) mixed tetramer consisting of two types of catalytic alpha subunit , but the PHY-1 and PHY-2 polypeptides also form active PHY/PDI dimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The lengths of peptide substrates have a major effect on their interaction with the P4H tetramers , the K(m) values decreasing markedly with increasing chain length .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This phenomenon has been explained in terms of processive binding of the two catalytic subunits to long peptides .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We determined here the K(m) values of a collagen P4H having two catalytic sites , the C. elegans mixed tetramer , and a form having only one such site , the PHY-1/PDI dimer , for peptides of varying lengths .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">All the K(m) values of the PHY-1/PDI dimer were found to be about 1.5-2.5 times those of the tetramer , but increasing peptide length led to identical decreases in the values of both enzyme forms .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The K(m) for a nonhydroxylated collagen fragment with 33 -X-Y-Gly-triplets but only 11 -X-Pro-Gly-triplets was found to correspond to the number of the former <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> the latter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">To study the individual roles of the two catalytic sites in a tetramer , we produced mutant PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI)(2) tetramers in which binding of the Fe(2+) ion or 2-oxoglutarate to one of the two catalytic sites was prevented .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The activities of the mutant tetramers decreased to markedly less than 50 % of that of the wild type , being about 5-10 % and 20-30 % with the enzymes having one of the two Fe(2+)-binding sites or 2-oxoglutarate-binding sites inactivated , respectively , while <scope type="neg" id="1">the K(m) values for these cosubstrates or peptide substrates were <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Our data thus <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> although collagen P4Hs do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> act on peptide substrates by a processive mechanism</scope></scope> , prevention of hydroxylation at one of the two catalytic sites in the tetramer impairs the function of the other catalytic site .</sentence>
