Pronuclear stage porcine embryos do not possess a strict asymmetric distribution of lysine 9 dimethylation of histone H3 based solely on parental origin. 
Epigenetic modification of core histone proteins plays an important role in gene transcription and chromatin structure. It is known that the methylation status of the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9) is closely linked with repression of transcription and heterochromatin formation. It has been reported that a strict asymmetric distribution of the dimethylated form of H3K9 exists between the two parental genomes in murine embryos. The aim of this study was to characterize the H3K9 dimethylation pattern in cleavage stage porcine embryos. Indirect immunocytochemical analysis showed that this modification is present throughout the nuclei of pronuclear, 2-cell, 4-cell and blastocyst stage porcine embryos. However, at the pronuclear stage the pronuclei within in vitro-fertilized porcine embryos possessed an asymmetric distribution of the dimethylated form of H3K9; this distribution was not based solely on the parent-of-origin. These results show that dimethylation of H3K9 is differentially regulated in pronuclear stage porcine embryos.
