<sentence id="0">New insights into NF-kappaB regulation and function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappaB ( nuclear factor-kappaB ) transcription factors have multiple critical roles in the regulation of immune responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In unstimulated cells , NF-kappaB proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkappaB inhibitory proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Various immune stimuli induce the IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) to phosphorylate IkappaBs , triggering their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation , which permits nuclear translocation of associated NF-kappaB subunits and activation of NF-kappaB target genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recent studies have highlighted the importance of dynamic ubiquitination-deubiquitination events in regulating this canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Ubiquitination additionally plays critical roles in activation of the noncanonical pathway that regulates NF-kappaB via signal-induced processing of NF-kappaB2 p100 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">New research has also identified several novel regulatory proteins that control the transcriptional activity of nuclear NF-kappaB .</sentence>
