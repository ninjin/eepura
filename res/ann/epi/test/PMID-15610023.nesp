<sentence id="0">Toward the insulin-IGF-I intermediate structures : functional and structural properties of the [ TyrB25NMePheB26 ] insulin mutant .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The origins of differentiation of insulin from insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) are still unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To address the problem of a structural and biological switch from the mostly metabolic hormonal activity of insulin to the predominant growth factor activities of IGF-I , an insulin analogue with IGF-I-like structural features has been synthesized .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Insulin residues Phe(B25) and Tyr(B26) have been swapped with the IGF-I-like Tyr(24) and Phe(25) sequence with a simultaneous methylation of the peptide nitrogen of residue Phe(B26) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These modifications were <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">expected</cue> to introduce a substantial kink in the main chain</scope> , as observed at residue Phe(25) in the IGF-I crystal structure .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These alterations <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> provide insight into the structural origins of insulin-IGF-I structural and functional divergence</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The [ Tyr(B25)NMePhe(B26) ] mutant has been characterized , and its crystal structure has been determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Surprisingly , all of these changes are well accommodated within an insulin R6 hexamer .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Only one molecule of each dimer in the hexamer responds to the structural alterations , the other remaining very similar to wild-type insulin .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">All alterations , modest in their scale , cumulate in the C-terminal part of the B-chain ( residues B23-B30 ) , which moves toward the core of the insulin molecule and is associated with a significant shift of the A1 helix toward the C-terminus of the B-chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These changes do <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> produce the expected bend of the main chain</scope> , but the fold of the mutant does reflect some structural characteristics of IGF-1 , and in addition establishes the CO(A19)-NH(B25) hydrogen bond , which is normally characteristic of T-state insulin .</sentence>
