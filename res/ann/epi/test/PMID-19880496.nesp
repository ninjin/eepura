<sentence id="0">Ubiquitination and degradation of the thrombopoietin receptor c-Mpl .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulation of growth factor and cytokine signaling is essential for maintaining physiologic numbers of circulating hematopoietic cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Thrombopoietin ( Tpo ) , acting through its receptor c-Mpl , is required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and megakaryopoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Therefore , the negative regulation of Tpo signaling is critical in many aspects of hematopoiesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we determine the mechanisms of c-Mpl degradation in the negative regulation of Tpo signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that , after Tpo stimulation , c-Mpl is degraded by both the lysosomal and proteasomal pathways and c-Mpl is rapidly ubiquitinated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using site-directed mutagenesis , we were able to determine that c-Mpl is ubiquitinated on both of its intracellular lysine ( K ) residues ( K(553) and K(573) ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">By mutating these residues to arginine , ubiquitination and degradation were significantly reduced and caused hyperproliferation in cell lines expressing these mutated receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Using short interfering RNA and dominant negative overexpression , we also found that c-Cbl , which is activated by Tpo , acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the ubiquitination of c-Mpl .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our findings identify a previously <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> negative regulatory pathway for Tpo signaling that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> significantly impact our understanding of the mechanisms affecting the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
