<sentence id="0">Arabidopsis UEV1D promotes Lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination and is involved in DNA damage response .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">DNA damage tolerance ( DDT ) in budding yeast requires Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and the Ubc enzyme variant ( Uev ) methyl methanesulfonate2 ( Mms2 ) are required for this process .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Mms2 homologs have been found in all eukaryotic genomes examined ; however , their roles in multicellular eukaryotes have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">not</cue> been elucidated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We report the isolation and characterization of four UEV1 genes from Arabidopsis thaliana .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">All four Uev1 proteins can form a stable complex with At Ubc13 or with Ubc13 from yeast or human and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">can</cue> promote Ubc13-mediated Lys-63 polyubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">All four Uev1 proteins can replace yeast MMS2 DDT functions in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Although these genes are ubiquitously expressed in most tissues , <scope type="spec" id="2"> UEV1D <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to express at a much higher level in germinating seeds and in pollen</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We obtained and characterized two uev1d null mutant T-DNA insertion lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Compared with wild-type plants , seeds from uev1d null plants germinated poorly when treated with a DNA-damaging agent .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Those that germinated grew slower , and the majority ceased growth within 2 weeks .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Pollen from uev1d plants also displayed a moderate but significant decrease in germination in the presence of DNA damage .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">This report links Ubc13-Uev with functions in DNA damage response in Arabidopsis .</sentence>
