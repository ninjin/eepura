<sentence id="0">Structural characterization of macroH2A containing chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">MacroH2A ( mH2A ) is one of the most recently identified members of the heteromorphous histone variant family .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is unique among the members of this group because it contains an unusually large non-histone C-terminal end , from where <scope type="spec" id="0"> its name derives , and <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be restricted to subphylum vertebrata</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although a concerted effort has been carried out in order to characterize the physiological relevance of mH2A , little is known in comparison about the structural importance of the molecule .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Elucidating the biophysical and conformational proprieties of mH2A in chromatin <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> provide clues into the links between this histone variant and its unique function(s)</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this paper , we look first at the heterogeneous tissue-specific distribution of this protein in different vertebrate classes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This is followed by a structural comparison between mH2A and H2A protein and by the characterization of the nucleosome core particles with which these histone subtypes are associated .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We find that the highly alpha-helical C-terminus of mH2A confers an asymmetric conformation to nucleosomes and that this variant is tightly bound to chromatin fragments in a way that does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> depend on the overall extent of acetylation of the other core histones</scope> .</sentence>
