<sentence id="0">Molecular analysis of the loss of somatic instability in the bz2::mu1 allele of maize .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Multiple genetic and epigenetic changes were detected within one plant generation at the bz2::mu1 mutable allele in a population of 118 plants .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Loss of somatic instability in bz2::mu1 was usually correlated with methylation of the Mu1 transposable element ; in 6 plants , somatic instability was lost as a result of mutations in bz2::mu1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This is a surprisingly high frequency of mutation per allele ( 2.5 % ) for the Mutator family , for which germinal revertants occur at a frequency of about 10(-4) per gamete .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One germinal excision event was found that contained an 8 bp deletion , frameshift mutation in Bronze-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The three other mutants described occurred as a result of abortive transposition , in which 75-77 bp deletions were generated at the junction between Bronze-2 and Mu1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We discuss the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> mechanisms</scope> , and the role of host factors in abortive transposition in maize .</sentence>
