<sentence id="0">The transcriptional enhancer of the pea plastocyanin gene associates with the nuclear matrix and regulates gene expression through histone acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The influence of the transcriptional enhancer of the pea plastocyanin gene ( PetE ) on the acetylation of histones was examined with chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments using antibodies that recognize acetylated or nonacetylated histones H3 and H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In transgenic tobacco plants containing the pea PetE promoter fused to uidA , both acetylated and nonacetylated histones H3 and H4 were present on the integrated transgene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Linking the PetE enhancer to the transgene resulted in increased beta-glucuronidase activity and increased amounts of acetylated histones H3 and H4 present on the promoter , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the enhancer <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> increase transcription by mediating the acetylation of histones</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Trichostatin A and sodium butyrate , which are potent inhibitors of histone deacetylases ( HDAs ) , activated expression from the PetE promoter by fourfold , with a concomitant increase in the acetylation states of histones H3 and H4 , as determined by ChIP , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> the acetylation of histones has a direct positive effect on transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The HDA inhibitors did not increase expression from the PetE promoter when it was linked to the enhancer , consistent with preexisting hyperacetylated histones on the transgene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mapping of histone acetylation states along the reporter gene <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> the histones H3 and H4 associated with the promoter and the 5' region of uidA were hyperacetylated in the presence of the PetE enhancer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The PetE enhancer bound to isolated tobacco nuclear matrices in vitro and was associated with the nuclear matrix in nuclei isolated from transgenic tobacco plants .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the pea PetE enhancer activates transcription by associating with the nuclear matrix , mediating the acetylation of histones on the promoter and the nearby coding region and resulting in an altered chromatin structure</scope> .</sentence>
