<sentence id="0">Rabbit secretory components of different allotypes vary in their carbohydrate content and their sites of N-linked glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in rabbit high and low Mr secretory components ( SC ) have been determined for the three known allotypes , t61 , t62 , and t63 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Purified SC polypeptides were subjected to mild periodate oxidation of terminal nonreducing sugars followed by selective reduction with [3H]sodium borohydride , SC polypeptides were further proteolytically cleaved , and the 3H-labeled peptides were isolated and characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Both high and low Mr SCs of the three allotypes possess a common glycosylation site at the asparagine residue position 400 , whereas the second site , in the amino-terminal domain of SC , was found to be variable : the t61 and t63 allotypes contained a glycosylation site at positions 70 and 90 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , although the t62 allotype was found to contain a triplet acceptor site ( N-X-S ) at positions 90-92 , analyses showed that less than 30 % of the t62 allotype peptides encompassing this region were glycosylated at residue 90 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , the amino acid sequence of the t61 SC in the region of residues 69-90 varies by 8 and 10 amino acid substitutions when compared with the t62 and t63 allotype sequences , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , neither the variation in amino acid sequence nor the variation in degree or site of glycosylation measurably affected the non-covalent binding of domain 1 to dimeric IgA .</sentence>
