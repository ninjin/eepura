<sentence id="0">Peli1 facilitates TRIF-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are pivotal in innate immunity and inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that genetic deficiency in Peli1 , an E3 ubiquitin ligase , attenuated the induction of proinflammatory cytokines by ligands of TLR3 and TLR4 and rendered mice resistant to septic shock .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Peli1 was required for TLR3-induced activation of IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) and its ' downstream ' target , transcription factor NF-kappaB , but was dispensable for IKK-NF-kappaB activation induced by several other TLRs and the interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Notably , Peli1 bound to and ubiquitinated RIP1 , a signaling molecule that mediates IKK activation induced by the TLR3 and TLR4 adaptor TRIF .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that Peli1 is a ubiquitin ligase needed for the transmission of TRIF-dependent TLR signals</scope> .</sentence>
