<sentence id="0">Characterization of protein kinase C-delta in mouse oocytes throughout meiotic maturation and following egg activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Changes in protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity influence the progression of meiosis ; however , <scope type="spec" id="0"> the specific function of the various PKC isoforms in female gametes is <cue type="spec" id="0">not known</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the current study , the protein expression and subcellular distribution profile of PKC-delta ( PKC-delta ) , a novel isoform of the PKC family , was determined in mouse oocytes undergoing meiotic maturation and following egg activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The full-length protein was observed as a doublet ( 76 and 78 kDa ) on Western blot analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A smaller ( 47 kDa ) carboxyl-terminal fragment , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">presumably</cue> the truncated catalytic domain of PKC-delta</scope> , was also strongly expressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both the full-length protein and the catalytic fragment became phosphorylated coincident with the resumption of meiosis and remained phosphorylated throughout metaphase II ( MII ) arrest .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Immunofluorescence staining showed PKC-delta distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm of oocytes during maturation and associated with the spindle apparatus during the first meiotic division .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Discrete foci of the protein also localized with the chromosomes in some mature eggs .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Following the completion of meiosis , PKC-delta became dephosphorylated within 2 h of in vitro fertilization or parthenogenetic activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The protein also accumulated in the nuclei of early embryos and was phosphorylated during M-phase of the initial mitotic cleavage division .</sentence>
