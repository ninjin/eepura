<sentence id="0">Concomitant hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen using purified enzymes in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Concomitant hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in protocollagen was studied using purified enzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that prolyl 4-hydroxylase ( prolyl-glycyl-peptide , 2-oxoglutarate : oxygen oxidoreductase ( 4-hydroxylating ) , EC 1.14.11.2 ) and lysyl hydroxylase ( peptidyllysine , 2-oxoglutarate ; oxygen 5-oxidoreductase , EC 1.14.11.4 ) are competing for the protocollagen substrate , this competition resulting in an inhibition of the lysyl hydroxylase but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase reaction</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">When the same protocollagen was used for these hydroxylases , the affinity of prolyl 4-hydroxylase to the protocollagen substrate was about 2-fold higher than that of lysyl hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Hydroxylation of lysine residues in protocollagen had <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effect on the affinity of prolyl 4-hydroxylase</scope> , whereas hydroxylation of proline residues decreased the affinity of lysyl hydroxylase to one-half of the value determined before the hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When enzyme preparations containing different ratios of lysyl hydroxylase activity to prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity were used to hydroxylase protocollagen substrate , it was found that in the case of a low ratio <scope type="spec" id="3"> the hydroxylation of lysine residues <cue type="spec" id="3">seemed</cue> to proceed only after a short lag period</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Accordingly , it <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">seems</cue> <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">probable</cue> that most proline residues are hydroxylated to 4-hydroxyproline residues before hydroxylation of lysine residues if the prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase are present as free enzymes competing for the same protocollagen substrate</scope></scope> .</sentence>
