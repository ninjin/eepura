E1000	Speculation:T1000 Scope:T1001
T1001	Span 222 605	suggest that prolyl 4-hydroxylase (prolyl-glycyl-peptide, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.11.2) and lysyl hydroxylase (peptidyllysine, 2-oxoglutarate; oxygen 5-oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.11.4) are competing for the protocollagen substrate, this competition resulting in an inhibition of the lysyl hydroxylase but not of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase reaction
T1002	Negation 565 568	not
E1001	Negation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 565 605	not of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase reaction

E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1256 1340	the hydroxylation of lysine residues seemed to proceed only after a short lag period
T1006	Negation 846 848	no
E1003	Negation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 846 895	no effect on the affinity of prolyl 4-hydroxylase

E1004	Speculation:T1008 Scope:T1009
T1009	Span 1364 1610	probable that most proline residues are hydroxylated to 4-hydroxyproline residues before hydroxylation of lysine residues if the prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase are present as free enzymes competing for the same protocollagen substrate

E1005	Speculation:T1010 Scope:T1011
T1011	Span 1358 1610	seems probable that most proline residues are hydroxylated to 4-hydroxyproline residues before hydroxylation of lysine residues if the prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase are present as free enzymes competing for the same protocollagen substrate
