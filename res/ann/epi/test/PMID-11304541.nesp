<sentence id="0">Coactivator p300 acetylates the interferon regulatory factor-2 in U937 cells following phorbol ester treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Interferon regulatory factor-2 ( IRF-2 ) is a transcription factor of the IRF family that represses interferon-mediated gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we show that human monocytic U937 cells express truncated forms of IRF-2 containing the DNA binding domain but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> much of the C-terminal regulatory domain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">U937 cells are shown to respond to phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) to induce expression of histone acetylases p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor ( PCAF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , TPA treatment led to the appearance of full-length IRF-2 , along with a reduction of the truncated protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Interestingly , full-length IRF-2 in TPA-treated U937 cells occurred as a complex with p300 as well as PCAF and was itself acetylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Consistent with these results , recombinant IRF-2 was acetylated by p300 and to a lesser degree by PCAF in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Another IRF member , IRF-1 , an activator of interferon-mediated transcription , was also acetylated in vitro by these acetylases .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , we demonstrate that the addition of IRF-2 but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> IRF-1</scope> inhibits core histone acetylation by p300 in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The addition of IRF-2 also inhibited acetylation of nucleosomal histones in TPA-treated U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Acetylated IRF-2 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> affect local chromatin structure in vivo by inhibiting core histone acetylation</scope> and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> serve as a mechanism by which IRF-2 negatively regulates interferon-inducible transcription</scope> .</sentence>
