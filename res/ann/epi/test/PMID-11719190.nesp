<sentence id="0">Developmentally regulated glycosylation of the CD8alphabeta coreceptor stalk modulates ligand binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The functional consequences of glycan structural changes associated with cellular differentiation are ill defined .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Herein , we investigate the role of glycan adducts to the O-glycosylated polypeptide stalk tethering the CD8alphabeta coreceptor to the thymocyte surface .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that immature CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes bind MHCI tetramers more avidly than mature CD8 single-positive thymocytes , and that this differential binding is governed by developmentally programmed O-glycan modification controlled by the ST3Gal-I sialyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">ST3Gal-I induction and attendant core 1 sialic acid addition to CD8beta on mature thymocytes decreases CD8alphabeta-MHCI avidity by altering CD8alphabeta domain-domain association and/or orientation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hence , glycans on the CD8beta stalk <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appear</cue> to modulate the ability of the distal binding surface of the dimeric CD8 globular head domains to clamp MHCI</scope> .</sentence>
