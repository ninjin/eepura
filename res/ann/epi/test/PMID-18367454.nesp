<sentence id="0">The association of GSK3 beta with E2F1 facilitates nerve growth factor-induced neural cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It is widely acknowledged that E2F1 and GSK3beta are both involved in the process of cell differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the relationship between E2F1 and GSK3beta in cell differentiation has yet to be discovered .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we provide evidence that in the differentiation of PC12 cells induced by nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , GSK3beta was increased at both the mRNA and protein levels , whereas E2F1 at these two levels was decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both wild-type GSK3beta and its kinase-defective mutant GSK3beta KM can inhibit E2F1 by promoting its ubiquitination through physical interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In addition , the colocalization of GSK3beta and E2F1 and their subcellular distribution , regulated by NGF , were observed in the process of PC12 differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">At the tissue level , GSK3beta colocalized and interacted with E2F1 in mouse hippocampus .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , GSK3beta facilitated neurite outgrowth by rescuing the promoter activities of Cdk inhibitors p21 and p15 from the inhibition caused by E2F1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">To summarize , our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that GSK3beta can promote the ubiquitination of E2F1 via physical interaction and thus inhibit its transcription activity in a kinase activity independent manner , which plays an important role in the NGF-induced PC12 differentiation</scope> .</sentence>
