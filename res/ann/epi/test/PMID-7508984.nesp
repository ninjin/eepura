<sentence id="2">We have found that the introduction of a single 2'-hydroxyl group on the sugar-phosphate backbone of the B-DNA decamer d(CCGGCGCCGG) transforms it to A-DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus , for the first time the X-ray structures of the same sequence have been observed in both the A and B-DNA conformations , permitting a comparison .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Crystals of the DNA-RNA chimeric decamer d(CCGGC)r(G)d(CCGG) belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions a = 25.63 A , b = 45.24 A and c = 47.99 A , and one decamer duplex in the asymmetric unit .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The structure was solved by a rigid body search using the coordinates of the isomorphous structure d(CCCGGCCGGG) and refined to an R value of 0.136 using 2753 unique reflections at 1.9 A resolution .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The final model contains 406 nucleotide atoms and 61 water molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The chimeric duplex exhibits typical A-DNA geometry , with all the sugars in the C(3')-endo puckering and the base-pairs inclined and displaced from the helix axis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The 2'-hydroxyl groups on rG6 and rG16 protrude into the minor groove surface and form different types of hydrogen bonds ; that on strand 1 forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the furanose ring O(4 ' ) of a symmetry-related C1 residue , while that on strand 2 is involved in two water bridges .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Crystal packing forces the G4-G17 base-pair in the top half of the duplex to slide significantly into the minor groove compared to the corresponding G7-G14 base-pair in the bottom half , resulting in these base-pairs exhibiting different base stacking and intermolecular interactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The base G4 of the G4-G17 base-pair forms an unorthodox base " triple " , G4*(G10-C11) , hydrogen-bonding through its minor groove sites N(2) and N(3) to the minor groove atoms N(2) and O(2) of both bases of the G10-C11 base-pair of a symmetry-related molecule .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The base G10 of this triple in turn forms a second similar unorthodox base triple , G10*(G3*C18) , with the adjacent base-pair G3-C18 of the duplex , thus G10 is involved in a double triple .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">On the other hand , in the bottom half of the duplex , the C7-G14 base-pair is involved only in a single similar unorthodox base triple with G20 , (C7-G14)*G20 , while the adjacent base-pair rG6-C15 is involved in a novel quadruple with C1-G20 , ( rG6-C15 ) * ( C1-G20 ) , where the latter base-pairs are hydrogen-bonded to each other via the minor groove sites G(N(2)) ...</sentence>
