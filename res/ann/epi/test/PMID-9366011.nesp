<sentence id="1">The polydnavirus associated with the parasitic wasp Campoletis sonorensis is injected into the lepidopteran insect , Heliothis virescens , during parasitization , after which viral gene products suppress the cellular immune system of the hosts .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Four related cysteine-rich polydnavirus gene have been identified in parasitized H. virescens larvae and grouped into a family .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we investigated the expression and hemocyte targeting of the cysteine-rich VHv1.4 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Full-length and truncated VHv1.4 proteins were produced in a bacterial expression system , and the purified proteins were used to raise polyclonal antisera .</sentence>
