<sentence id="0">Discrete domains of MARCH1 mediate its localization , functional interactions , and posttranscriptional control of expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Within APCs , ubiquitination regulates the trafficking of immune modulators such as MHC class II and CD86 ( B7.2 ) molecules .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">MARCH1 ( membrane-associated RING-CH ) , a newly identified ubiquitin E3 ligase expressed in APCs , ubiquitinates MHC class II , thereby reducing its surface expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Following LPS-induced maturation of dendritic cells , MARCH1 mRNA is down-regulated and MHC class II is redistributed to the cell surface from endosomal compartments .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we show that MARCH1 expression is also regulated at the posttranscriptional level .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In primary dendritic cell and APC cell lines of murine origin , MARCH1 had a half-life of < 30 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="0"> MARCH1 degradation <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to occur partly in lysosomes , since inhibiting lysosomal activity stabilized MARCH1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similar stabilization was observed when MARCH1-expressing cells were treated with cysteine protease inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Mutational analyses of MARCH1 defined discrete domains required for destabilization , proper localization , and functional interaction with substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , these data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that MARCH1 expression is regulated at a posttranscriptional level by trafficking within the endolysosomal pathway where MARCH1 is proteolyzed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The short half-life of MARCH1 permits very rapid changes in the levels of the protein in response to changes in the mRNA , resulting in efficient induction of Ag presentation once APCs receive maturational signals .</sentence>
