<sentence id="0">Caveolin-1 mediates endotoxin inhibition of endothelin-1-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) plays a key role in the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) activation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells ( LSECs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the presence of endotoxin , an increase in caveolin-1 ( Cav-1 ) expression impairs ET-1/eNOS signaling ; however , the molecular mechanism is unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of Cav-1 in the regulation of LPS suppression of ET-1-mediated eNOS activation in LSECs by examining the effect of caveolae disruption using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin ( CD ) and filipin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Treatment with 5 mM CD for 30 min increased eNOS activity ( +255 % , P < 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A dose ( 0.25 microg/ml ) of filipin for 30 min produced a similar effect ( +111 % , P < 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CD induced the perinuclear localization of Cav-1 and eNOS and stimulated NO production in the same region .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Readdition of 0.5 mM cholesterol to saturate CD reversed these effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Both the combined treatment with CD and ET-1 ( CD + ET-1 ) and with filipin and ET-1 stimulated eNOS activity ; however , pretreatment with endotoxin ( LPS ) abrogated these effects .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Following LPS pretreatment , CD + ET-1 <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failed</cue> to stimulate eNOS activity ( +51 % , P > 0.05 ) , which contributed to the reduced levels of eNOS-Ser1177 phosphorylation and eNOS-Thr495 dephosphorylation , the LPS/CD-induced overexpression and translocation of Cav-1 in the perinuclear region , and the increased perinuclear colocalization of eNOS with Cav-1</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results supported the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesis</cue> that Cav-1 mediates the action of endotoxin in suppressing ET-1-mediated eNOS activation</scope> and demonstrated that the manipulation of caveolae produces significant effects on ET-1-mediated eNOS activity in LSECs .</sentence>
