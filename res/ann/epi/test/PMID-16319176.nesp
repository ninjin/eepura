<sentence id="0">Inositol deacylation by Bst1p is required for the quality control of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Misfolded proteins are recognized in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , transported back to the cytosol , and degraded by the proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A number of proteins are processed and modified by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor in the ER , but the quality control mechanisms of GPI-anchored proteins remain unclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report on the quality control mechanism of misfolded GPI-anchored proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have constructed a mutant form of the beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase Gas1p ( Gas1*p ) as a model misfolded GPI-anchored protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Gas1*p was modified with a GPI anchor but retained in the ER and was degraded rapidly via the proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Disruption of BST1 , which encodes GPI inositol deacylase , caused a delay in the degradation of Gas1*p .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This delay was because of an effect on the deacylation activity of Bst1p .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Disruption of genes involved in GPI-anchored protein concentration and N-glycan processing caused different effects on the degradation of Gas1*p and a soluble misfolded version of carboxypeptidase Y .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Furthermore , Gas1*p associated with both Bst1p and BiP/Kar2p , a molecular chaperone , in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that GPI inositol deacylation plays important roles in the quality control and ER-associated degradation of GPI-anchored proteins</scope> .</sentence>
