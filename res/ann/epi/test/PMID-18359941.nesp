<sentence id="0">Members of the E2D ( UbcH5 ) family mediate the ubiquitination of the conserved cysteine of Pex5p , the peroxisomal import receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">According to current models of peroxisomal biogenesis , newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins are transported into the organelle by Pex5p .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Pex5p recognizes these proteins in the cytosol , mediates their membrane translocation , and is exported back into the cytosol in an ATP-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have previously shown that export of Pex5p is preceded by ( and requires ) monoubiquitination of a conserved cysteine residue present at its N terminus .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In yeasts , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">probably</cue> also in plants</scope> , ubiquitination of Pex5p is mediated by a specialized ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme , Pex4p .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In mammals , the identity of this enzyme has remained <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue> for many years</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Here , we provide evidence <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that E2D1/2/3 ( UbcH5a/b/c ) are the mammalian functional counterparts of yeast/plant Pex4p</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The mechanistic implications of these findings are discussed .</sentence>
