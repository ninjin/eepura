<sentence id="0">Aberrant histone modifications at the thyrotropin-releasing hormone gene in resistance to thyroid hormone : analysis of F455S mutant thyroid hormone receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We reported a novel mutation of thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-beta , F455S , in a patient with pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone ( RTH ) , who showed impaired release of nuclear receptor corepressor and abnormal histone deacetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we further analyzed the histone modifications and the dynamics of TR and RNA polymerase II on the TRH gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The lysine residues 9 ( H3K9 ) and 14 ( K14 ) of the histone H3 were acetylated in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of thyroid hormone ( TH ) , and addition of TH caused a temporary deacetylation of both residues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although H3K4 was di- and trimethylated in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of T(3)</scope> , <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> methylation of H3K9 or K27 was detected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Long-term incubation with T(3) decreased the level of trimethylated H3K4 , the amount of TR , and the level of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> dimethylated H3K4</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Treatment with an inhibitor for H3K4 methyltransferase , 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine , decreased basal promoter activity but did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> affect the repression by TH</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Conversely , overexpression of MLL , an H3K4-specific methyltransferase , caused an increase in basal activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In the presence of F455S , methylation of H3K4 and the dynamics of TR were intact , but both H3K9 and H3K14 were hyperacetylated , and T(3)-induced deacetylation was impaired , resulting in a high transcriptional level .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings demonstrated that 1 ) negative regulation of the TRH gene by TH involves both the acetylation and methylation of specific residues of histone tails and changing the amount of TR , and 2 ) the major impairment to histone modifications in F455S was hyperacetylation of the specific histone tails .</sentence>
