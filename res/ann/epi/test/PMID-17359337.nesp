<sentence id="0">Anti-angiogenic effect of tetraacetyl-phytosphingosine .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In a search for the wound healing accelerators , we found that tetraacetyl-phytosphingosine ( TAPS ) , a sphingolipid metabolite produced by phytosphingosine acetylation , has significant inhibitory potential on healing of rabbit ear wound .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As angiogenesis is fundamental to proper wound healing , we examined the effect of TAPS on angiogenesis using human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TAPS markedly decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced chemotactic migration and capillary-like tube formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recognizing its inhibitory potential on angiogenesis , we further investigated the action mechanism of TAPS .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">TAPS significantly inhibited VEGF-induced proteolytic enzyme production , including matrix metalloproteinase-2 , urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">TAPS also suppressed VEGF-induced phosphorylation of p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , TAPS abolished VEGF-induced intracellular calcium increase , measured using laser scanning confocal microscopy .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , these results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that TAPS exerts its inhibitory action on angiogenesis through the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and intracellular calcium increase , thereby affecting the process of wound healing negatively</scope> .</sentence>
