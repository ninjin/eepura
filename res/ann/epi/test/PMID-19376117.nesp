<sentence id="0">HSP70 protects BCL2L12 and BCL2L12A from N-terminal ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BCL2L12 has been found to be associated with favorable prognosis in breast cancer patients while correlated with tumorigenesis of glioblastoma and colon cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we report that BCL2L12 and its transcript variant BCL2L12A are degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Interestingly , the ubiquitinations and degradations of BCL2L12 and BCL2L12A are independent of the internal lysine residues but the first N-terminal residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , HSP70 was identified to interact with BCL2L12 and BCL2L12A and protected them from ubiquitinations and degradations in mammalian cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In summary , HSP70 protects BCL2L12 and BCL2L12A from N-terminal ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
