<sentence id="0">An endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase is induced by hypoxia and acts on hypoxia-inducible factor alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Prolyl 4-hydroxylases ( P4Hs ) act on collagens ( C-P4Hs ) and the oxygen-dependent degradation domains ( ODDDs ) of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits ( HIF-P4Hs ) leading to degradation of the latter .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report data on a human P4H possessing a transmembrane domain ( P4H-TM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Its gene is also found in zebrafish but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in flies and nematodes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Its sequence more closely resembles those of the C-P4Hs than the HIF-P4Hs , but it <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> the peptide substrate-binding domain of the C-P4Hs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">P4H-TM levels in cultured cells are increased by hypoxia , and P4H-TM is N-glycosylated and is located in endoplasmic reticulum membranes with its catalytic site inside the lumen , a location differing from those of the HIF-P4Hs .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Despite this , P4H-TM overexpression in cultured neuroblastoma cells reduced HIF-alpha ODDD reporter construct levels , and its small interfering RNA increased HIF-1alpha protein level , in the same way as those of HIF-P4Hs .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , recombinant P4H-TM hydroxylated the two critical prolines in HIF-1alpha ODDD in vitro , with a preference for the C-terminal proline , whereas it did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> hydroxylate any prolines in recombinant type I procollagen chains</scope> .</sentence>
