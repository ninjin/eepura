<sentence id="0">Cloning and characterization of a calcium-sensing receptor from the hypercalcemic New Zealand white rabbit reveals unaltered responsiveness to extracellular calcium .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The extracellular Ca2+ ( Ca(0)2+)-sensing receptor ( CaR ) recently cloned from mammalian parathyroid , kidney , brain , and thyroid plays a central role in maintaining near constancy of Ca(0)2+ .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously showed that the hypercalcemia normally present in New Zealand white rabbits is associated with an elevated set point for Ca(02+)-regulated PTH release ( the level of Ca(0)2+ half-maximally inhibiting hormonal secretion ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This observation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> an alteration in the Ca(02+)-sensing mechanism in the rabbit parathyroid , a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibility</scope></cue> we have now pursued by isolating and characterizing the rabbit homolog of the CaR</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The cloned rabbit kidney CaR ( RabCaR ) shares a high degree of overall homology ( > 90 % amino acid identity ) with the bovine , human , and rat CaRs , although it differs slightly in several regions of the extracellular domain <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> involved in binding ligands</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By Northern analysis and/or immunohistochemistry , a <scope type="spec" id="3"> similar <cue type="spec" id="3">or</cue> identical</scope> receptor is also expressed in parathyroid , thyroid C cells , small and large intestine , and in the thick ascending limb and collecting ducts of the kidney .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">When expressed transiently in HEK293 cells and assayed functionally through CaR agonist-evoked increases in Ca(i)2+ , the rabbit CaR shows apparent affinities for Ca(0)2+ , Mg(0)2+ , and Gd(0)3+ that are indistinguishable from those observed in studies carried out concomitantly using the human CaR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Therefore , at least as assessed by its ability to increase Ca(i)2+ when expressed in HEK293 cells , the intrinsic functional properties of the rabbit CaR cannot explain the hypercalcemia observed in vivo in the New Zealand white rabbit .</sentence>
