<sentence id="0">Cardiomyopathy associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cardiovascular disease represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While it was once <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> that atherosclerotic vascular disease was responsible for all of these adverse effects</scope> , recent studies support the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">notion</cue> that one of the major adverse complications of diabetes is the development of a diabetic cardiomyopathy characterized by defects in both diastolic and systolic function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Contributing to the development of the cardiomyopathy is a shift in myosin isozyme content in favor of the least active V3 form .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Also defective in the noninsulin-dependent diabetic heart is regulation of calcium homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While transport of calcium by the sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular calcium pumps are minimally affected by noninsulin-dependent diabetes , significant impairment occurs in sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This defect limits the ability of of the diabetic heart to extrude calcium , contributing to an elevation in [Ca2+]i .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Also promoting the accumulation of calcium by the diabetic cell is a decrease in Na+ , K+ ATPase activity , which is known to increase [Ca2+]i secondary to a rise in [Na+]i .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , calcium influx via the calcium channel is stimulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Although <scope type="spec" id="2"> the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are presently <cue type="spec" id="2">unknown</cue></scope> , the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibility</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="4"> they <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be related to aberrations in glucose or lipid metabolism</scope></scope> are considered .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The evidence <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggests</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="6"> classical theories of glucose toxicity , such as excessive polyol production or glycosylation , <cue type="spec" id="6">appear</cue> to be insignificant factors in heart</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Also insignificant are defects in lipid metabolism leading to accumulation of toxic lipid amphiphiles or triacylglycerol .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Rather , the major defects involve membrane changes , such as phosphatidylethanolamine N-methylation and protein phosphorylation , which can be attributed to the state of insulin resistance .</sentence>
