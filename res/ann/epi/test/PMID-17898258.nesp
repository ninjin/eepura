<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> PURPOSE : Aberrant promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands is <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to play an important role in the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes ( TSGs ) in cancer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Studies of cutaneous melanoma have reported a high methylation rate for MGMT , DAPK , RAR-b2 , and RASSF1A .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In colon cancer , SOCS-1 , IGF-2 , RUNX3 , NEUROG1 , and CACNA1G are commonly inactivated .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The concomitant methylation of at least three of these genes <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> represent a distinct trait , the CpG island methylator phenotype ( CIMP )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of epigenetic inactivation of multiple genes in uveal melanoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">METHODS : Twenty samples of uveal melanoma were analyzed for the methylation status of nine candidate cancer-related genes : MGMT , DAPK , RAR-b2 , RASSF1A , SOCS-1 , IGF-2 , RUNX3 , NEUROG1 , and CACNA1G , using real-time quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction after sodium bisulfite modification .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RESULTS : Methylation rates of the genes commonly inactivated in cutaneous melanoma were 70 % for RASSFIA , 5 % for MGMT and DAPK , and 0 for RAR-b2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">The</cue> rates for the CIMP-related genes were 25 % for RUNX3</scope> , 5 % for NEUROG1 and CACNA1G , and 0 for SOCS-1 and IGF-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">None of the samples was CIMP-positive .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSIONS : In this study uveal melanoma was negative for CIMP , with hypermethylation of RASSF1A .</sentence>

<sentence id="12">Given that mutations in genes of the RAS pathway are rarely observed in uveal melanoma , epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be an alternative mechanism of tumorigenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The low frequency of promoter methylation of TSGs commonly inactivated in cutaneous melanoma further stratifies the different tumorigenesis pathway in cutaneous and uveal melanoma .</sentence>
