<sentence id="0">Topological analysis of peripherin/rds and abnormal glycosylation of the pathogenic Pro216-->Leu mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Peripherin / rds is an integral membrane glycoprotein found in the rim regions of vertebrate photoreceptor cell discs .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The protein is <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be involved in both formation and maintenance of the characteristic flattened morphology of the outer segment discs and its essential nature</scope> is demonstrated by the wide range of retinal degenerative disorders in which the protein has an involvement .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Little structural data has been determined for peripherin / rds , but <scope type="spec" id="1"> a topological model of the protein has been <cue type="spec" id="1">proposed</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this paper , we present the first direct evidence for the topology of the protein through the use of scanning glycosylation mutagenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both the topological data and the observation that only the Asn(229) site is efficiently glycosylated in this in vitro transcription/translation system support the common hypotheses .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , expression of the Pro(216)-->Leu mutant demonstrates an abnormal glycosylation pattern , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> explain the mechanism by which this mutation precipitates a retinal degenerative phenotype</scope> .</sentence>
