T1001	Span 816 992	The beta-methyl branch is presumably further hydroxylated (by TaH) and methylated to produce the methoxymethyl group observed in myxovirescin A. To substantiate this hypothesis
T1002	Speculation 544 553	suggested
E1001	Speculation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 544 814	suggested that three more proteins--TaX and TaY, which are members of the superfamily of enoyl-CoA hydratases (ECHs), and a variant ketosynthase (KS) TaK--are shared between two ACP-HMGS pairs, to give the complete set of enzymes required to perform the beta-alkylations

E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1366 1435	implying a role for TaB/TaC in the formation of the beta-methyl group

T1007	Span 982 1117	hypothesis, a series of gene-deletion mutants were created, and the effects of these mutations on myxovirescin production were examined
