<sentence id="0">Genome-wide profiling of histone h3 lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation reveals an epigenetic signature in prostate carcinogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Increasing evidence implicates the critical roles of epigenetic regulation in cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Very recent reports <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> global gene silencing in cancer is associated with specific epigenetic modifications</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the relationship between epigenetic switches and more dynamic patterns of gene activation and repression has remained largely <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Genome-wide profiling of the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me3 ) and lysine 27 ( H3K27me3 ) was performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with whole genome promoter microarray ( ChIP-chip ) techniques .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Comparison of the ChIP-chip data and microarray gene expression data revealed that loss and/or gain of H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 were strongly associated with differential gene expression , including microRNA expression , between prostate cancer and primary cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The most common switches were gain or loss of H3K27me3 coupled with low effect on gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The least prevalent switches were between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 coupled with much higher fractions of activated and silenced genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Promoter patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 corresponded strongly with coordinated expression changes of regulatory gene modules , such as HOX and microRNA genes , and structural gene modules , such as desmosome and gap junction genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">A number of epigenetically switched oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were found overexpressed and underexpressed accordingly in prostate cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE : This work offers a dynamic picture of epigenetic switches in carcinogenesis and contributes to an overall understanding of coordinated regulation of gene expression in cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Our data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate</cue> an H3K4me3/H3K27me3 epigenetic signature of prostate carcinogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
