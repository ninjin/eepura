<sentence id="1">AIM : To investigate the relationship between methylation of Syk ( spleen tyrosine kinase ) gene in promoter region and oncogenesis , metastasis of gastric carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The relation between silencing of the Syk gene and methylation of Syk promoter region was also studied .</sentence>

<sentence id="6">Syk expression in gastric carcinoma was lower in 14 out of 61 gastric cancer samples than in adjacent normal tissues ( chi(2)=72.3 , P<0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">No methylation of Syk promoter was found in adjacent normal tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">hypermethylation of Syk gene in promoter was detected 21 cases in 61 gastric carcinoma patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The rate of methylation of Syk promoter in gastric carcinoma was higher than that in adjacent normal tissues ( chi(2)=25.1 , P<0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In 31 patients with lymph node metastasis , 17 were found with Syk promoter methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">A significant difference was noted between two groups ( chi(2)=11.4 , P<0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">CONCLUSION : Hypermethylation leads to silencing of the Syk gene in human gastric carcinoma .</sentence>
