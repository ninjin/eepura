<sentence id="0">Structural insights into the assembly and function of the SAGA deubiquitinating module .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">SAGA is a transcriptional coactivator complex that is conserved across eukaryotes and performs multiple functions during transcriptional activation and elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One role is deubiquitination of histone H2B , and this activity resides in a distinct subcomplex called the deubiquitinating module ( DUBm ) , which contains the ubiquitin-specific protease Ubp8 , bound to Sgf11 , Sus1 , and Sgf73 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The deubiquitinating activity depends on the presence of all four DUBm proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We report here the 1.90 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the DUBm bound to ubiquitin aldehyde , as well as the 2.45 angstrom resolution structure of the uncomplexed DUBm .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The structure reveals an arrangement of protein domains that gives rise to a highly interconnected complex , which is stabilized by eight structural zinc atoms that are critical for enzymatic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The structure <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> a model for how interactions with the other DUBm proteins activate Ubp8 and allows us to <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">speculate</cue> about how the DUBm binds to monoubiquitinated histone H2B in nucleosomes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
