<sentence id="0">Bivalirudin decreases NO bioavailability by vascular immobilization of myeloperoxidase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Bivalirudin , a direct thrombin inhibitor , has emerged as an important alternative to heparin in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , it remains elusive if <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> adverse</scope> extracoagulant properties are responsible for the fact that its favorable effects in clinical studies are mainly driven by a reduction in bleeding events .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The aim of the current study was to determine the effects and mechanisms of acute treatment with bivalirudin in comparison to heparin on NO bioavailability , an important factor for the pathogenesis of ischemic events .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In particular , we studied the interaction between bivalirudin and myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) , a leukocyte-derived enzyme that consumes endothelial-derived nitric oxide ( NO ) , modifies a variety of biological targets , and thus affects the integrity of the vessel wall .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention , bivalirudin , in contrast to heparin , exhibited a significant decrease in plasma MPO levels ( p = 0.03 ) accompanied by a deterioration of flow-mediated dilation ( p = 0.02 ) , a surrogate for endothelial NO bioavailability .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In vitro experiments revealed avid binding of bivalirudin to both bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) and MPO .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Methylation of bivalirudin carboxyl groups at the carboxyl-terminal end revealed the specific binding site of bivalirudin to MPO .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Bivalirudin-facilitated binding of MPO to BAEC resulted also in functional changes in terms of increased NO consumption as well as enhanced MPO-mediated redox modifications .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results illustrate dichotomous extracoagulant properties of heparins and thrombin inhibitors and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that bivalirudin acutely impairs endothelial NO bioavailability , thereby underscoring the <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> critical</scope> role of MPO as a mediator of vascular function</scope> .</sentence>
