<sentence id="0">HPV status-independent association of alcohol and tobacco exposure or prior radiation therapy with promoter methylation of FUSSEL18 , EBF3 , IRX1 , and SEPT9 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> SLC5A8</scope> , in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is an aggressive malignancy with more than half a million people being diagnosed with the disease annually .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Within the last 2 decades , the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) has been found to be associated with this malignancy .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">More recently , HPV-infected HNSCC has been found to exhibit higher levels of global DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In a recent study , we identified five tumor suppressive genes ( IRX1 , EBF3 , SLC5A8 , SEPT9 , and FUSSEL18 ) as frequently methylated in HNSCC biopsies using a global methylation analysis via restriction landmark genomic scanning .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we verify these genes as valid methylation markers in two separate sets of HNSCC specimens .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">By using the available clinical information linked to the patient specimens , we found a strong association between promoter methylation of FUSSEL18 , IRX1 , and EBF3 and prior radiation therapy ( P < 0.0001 ) irrespective of HPV status .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Also , promoter methylation of FUSSEL18 and SEPTIN9 was found to correlate significantly with exposure to alcohol and tobacco ( P = 0.021 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Importantly , in this study , we preliminarily show a trend between HPV16 positivity and specific target gene hypermethylation of IRX1 , EBF3 , SLC5A8 , and SEPT9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">If replicated in a larger study , the HPV status <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be a patient selection biomarker when determining the most efficacious treatment modality for these different subsets of patients ( e.g. , inclusion or exclusion of epigenetic therapies</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Equally notable and independent of HPV status , hypermethylation of the promoters of a subset of these genes in recurrences especially in the setting of prior radiation or in the setting of alcohol and tobacco use <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> help guide adjunctive inclusion or exclusion or epigenetic therapy</scope> .</sentence>
