<sentence id="0">Mutational uncoupling of the role of Sus1 in nuclear pore complex targeting of an mRNA export complex and histone H2B deubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Sus1 is an evolutionary conserved protein that functions both in transcription and mRNA export and has been proposed to contribute to coupling these processes in yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Sus1 mediates its different roles as a component of both the histone H2B deubiquitinating module ( Sus1-Sgf11-Ubp8-Sgf73 ) of the SAGA ( Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase ) transcriptional co-activator and the mRNA export complex , TREX-2 ( Sus1-Sac3-Thp1-Cdc31 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have dissected the different functions of Sus1 with respect to its partitioning in transcription and export complexes using a mutational approach .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that the sus1-10 ( E18A , S19A , and G20A ) and sus1-12 ( V73A and D75A ) alleles of Sus1 can be dissociated from TREX-2 while leaving its interaction with SAGA largely intact .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Conversely , the binding to both TREX-2 and SAGA was impaired in the sus1-11 allele ( G37A and W38A ) , in which two highly conserved residues were mutated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In vitro experiments demonstrated that dissociation of mutant Sus1 from its partners is caused by a reduced affinity toward the TREX-2 subunit , Sac3 , and the SAGA factor , Sgf11 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with the biochemical data , these sus1 mutant alleles showed differential genetic relationships with SAGA and mRNA export mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In vivo , all three sus1 mutants were impaired in targeting TREX-2 ( i.e. Sac3 ) to the nuclear pore complexes and exhibited nuclear mRNA export defects .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This study has implications for how Sus1 , in combination with distinct interaction partners , can regulate diverse aspects of gene expression .</sentence>
