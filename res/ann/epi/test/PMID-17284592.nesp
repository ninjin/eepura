<sentence id="0">Long-distance combinatorial linkage between methylation and acetylation on histone H3 N termini .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Individual posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) on histones have well established roles in certain biological processes , notably transcriptional programming .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recent genomewide studies describe patterns of covalent modifications , such as H3 methylation and acetylation at promoters of specific target genes , or " bivalent domains , " in stem cells , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggestive</cue> of a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possible</cue> combinatorial interplay between PTMs on the same histone</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , detection of long-range PTM associations is often problematic in antibody-based or traditional mass spectrometric-based analyses .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , histone H3 from a ciliate model was analyzed as an enriched source of transcriptionally active chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using a recently developed mass spectrometric approach , combinatorial modification states on single , long N-terminal H3 fragments ( residues 1-50 ) were determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The entire modification status of intact N termini was obtained and indicated correlations between K4 methylation and H3 acetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , K4 and K27 methylation were identified concurrently on one H3 species .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">This methodology is applicable to other histones and larger polypeptides and will <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">likely</cue> be a valuable tool in understanding the roles of combinatorial patterns of PTMs</scope> .</sentence>
