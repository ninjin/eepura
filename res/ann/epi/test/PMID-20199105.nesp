<sentence id="0">N-glycan-dependent quality control of the Na , K-ATPase beta(2) subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Bulky hydrophilic N-glycans stabilize the proper tertiary structure of glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition , N-glycans comprise the binding sites for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident lectins that assist correct folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To reveal the role of N-glycans in maturation of the Na , K-ATPase beta(2) subunit in the ER , the effects of preventing or modifying the beta(2) subunit N-glycosylation on trafficking of the subunit and its binding to the ER lectin chaperone , calnexin , were studied in MDCK cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Preventing N-glycosylation abolishes binding of the beta(2) subunit to calnexin and results in the ER retention of the subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , the fully N-glycosylated beta(2) subunit is retained in the ER when glycan-calnexin interactions are prevented by castanospermine , showing that N-glycan-mediated calnexin binding is required for correct subunit folding .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Calnexin binding persists for several hours after translation is stopped with cycloheximide , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the beta(2) subunit undergoes repeated post-translational calnexin-assisted folding attempts</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Homology modeling of the beta(2) subunit using the crystal structure of the alpha(1)-beta(1) Na , K-ATPase shows the presence of a relatively hydrophobic amino acid cluster proximal to N-glycosylation sites 2 and 7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Combined , but not separate , removal of sites 2 and 7 dramatically impairs calnexin binding and prevents the export of the beta(2) subunit from the ER .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Similarly , hydrophilic substitution of two hydrophobic amino acids in this cluster disrupts both beta(2)-calnexin binding and trafficking of the subunit to the Golgi .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Therefore , the hydrophobic residues in the proximity of N-glycans 2 and 7 are required for post-translational calnexin binding to these N-glycans in incompletely folded conformers , which , in turn , is necessary for maturation of the Na , K-ATPase beta(2) subunit .</sentence>
