Differences in the ligand specificity between CD1d-restricted T cells with limited and diverse T-cell receptor repertoire. 
The natural killer (NK) T-lymphocyte population consists of two subsets utilizing a diverse and restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, respectively. Both populations have been shown to include autoreactive cells. NKT cells carrying restricted Valpha14(AV14S1)Jalpha281/Vbeta8.2(BV8S2A1 ) TCR have been shown to recognize alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer) presented in the context of murine CD1d. In this study we screened a set of murine CD1d-autoreactive T-cell hybridomas with diverse TCR for their reactivity with several glycosylated variants of ceramide, including alphaGalCer. These hybridomas showed a different pattern of reactivity to CD1d-expressing antigen-presenting cells (APC) and were not reactive with any of the tested variants of ceramide. A second set of hybridomas had been selected for expression of Valpha14 and Vbeta8.2 TCR chains. These cells responded to alphaGalCer presented on CD1d, but were only weakly reactive to syngeneic splenocytes or CD1d-transfected cells. Their fine specificity in the response to glycosylation variants of ceramide demonstrated a homogenous reactivity pattern, including reactivity to alpha-galactosylsphingosine, the variant of alphaGalCer with truncated fatty acyl chain. These findings underline the differences in ligand specificity between the two subsets of CD1d-restricted NKT cells, and demonstrate a similarity in reactivity among the hybridomas using the Valpha14-Jalpha281/Vbeta8.2 TCR.
