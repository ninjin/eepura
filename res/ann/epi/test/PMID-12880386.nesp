<sentence id="0">Lgl1 , a mesenchymal modulator of early lung branching morphogenesis , is a secreted glycoprotein imported by late gestation lung epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Secreted glycoproteins serve a variety of functions related to cell-cell communication in developmental systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We cloned LGL1 , a novel glucocorticoid-inducible gene in foetal lung , and described its temporal and spatial localization in the rat .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Disruption of foetal mesenchyme-specific LGL1 expression using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides , which was associated with a 50 % decrease in lgl1 protein levels , inhibited airway epithelial branching in foetal rat gestational day 13 lung buds in explant culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that lgl1 functions as a secreted signalling molecule</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We now provide evidence supporting a role for lgl1 in mesenchymal-epithelial interactions that govern lung organogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Lgl1 is a secreted glycoprotein with a conserved N-terminal secretory signal peptide .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Using dual immunofluorescence , intracellular lgl1 was found to co-localize with markers of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum , consistent with its association with secretory vesicles .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Using pulse-chase studies , we show that lgl1 is a stable protein with a half-life of 11.5 h. Furthermore , at gestational days 20 and 21 ( term=22 ) , foetal distal lung epithelial cells import lgl1 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Taken together , our findings support distinct roles for lgl1 as a mediator of glucocorticoid-induced mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in early and late foetal lung organogenesis .</sentence>
