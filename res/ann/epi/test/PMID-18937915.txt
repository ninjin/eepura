The genomic landscapes of histone H3-Lys9 modifications of gene promoter regions and expression profiles in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. 
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of nonembryonic origins possess the proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation potentials. It has been established that epigenetic mechanisms could be critical for determining the fate of stem cells, and MSCs derived from different origins exhibited different expression profiles individually to a certain extent. In this study, ChIP-on-chip was used to generate genome-wide histone H3-Lys9 acetylation and dimethylation profiles at gene promoters in human bone marrow MSCs. We showed that modifications of histone H3-Lys9 at gene promoters correlated well with mRNA expression in human bone marrow MSCs. Functional analysis revealed that many key cellular pathways in human bone marrow MSC self-renewal, such as the canonical signaling pathways, cell cycle pathways and cytokine related pathways may be regulated by H3-Lys9 modifications. These data suggest that gene activation and silencing affected by H3-Lys9 acetylation and dimethylation, respectively, may be essential to the maintenance of human bone marrow MSC self-renewal and multi-potency.
