Value of p16INK4a and RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation in prognosis of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. 
The p16INK4a and RASSF1A are tumor suppressor genes frequently inactivated by de novo promoter hypermethylation in non-small cell lung cancer. We studied 119 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (70 stage I/II and 49 stage IIIA) who had undergone surgery with curative intent. The p16INK4a and RASSF1A promoter methylation statuses were determined by methylation-specific PCR. Statistical analyses, all two-sided, were performed to determine the prognostic effect of hypermethylation on various clinical parameters. Hypermethylation of the p16INK4a and RASSF1A promoters was found in 58 (49%) and 46 (39%) tumors, respectively, and 30 tumors (25%) exhibited hypermethylation of both gene promoters. In patients with stage I/II tumors, only p16INK4a promoter hypermethylation was associated with a poor 5-year overall survival rate (P=0.002). In patients with stage IIIA disease, however, RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation was a stronger predictor of a poor 5-year overall survival rate (P < 0.0001) than p16INK4a promoter hypermethylation. Among the 49 patients with stage IIIA tumors, 16 (89%) of the 18 patients whose tumors showed RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation died within 3 years after surgery, as compared with only 12 (39%) of the 31 patients whose tumors had no RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis indicated that RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation was the stronger independent predictor for survival in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Our results indicate that p16INK4a promoter hypermethylation predicts a poor 5-year survival rates for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer, particularly for those with early stage tumors, whereas RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation is a profound prognostic predictor for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, suggesting an important role of RASSF1A in non-small cell lung cancer progression.
