<sentence id="0">An insulator blocks spreading of histone acetylation and interferes with RNA polymerase II transfer between an enhancer and gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We studied the mechanism by which an insulator interrupts enhancer signaling to a gene using stably replicated chromatin templates containing the human beta-globin locus control region HS2 enhancer and a target globin gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The chicken beta-globin 5' HS4 ( cHS4 ) insulator acted as a positional enhancer blocker , inhibiting promoter remodeling and transcription activation only when placed between the enhancer and gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Enhancer blocking by cHS4 reduced histone hyperacetylation across a zone extending from the enhancer to the gene and inhibited recruitment of CBP and p300 to HS2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Enhancer blocking also led to accumulation of RNA polymerase II at HS2 and within cHS4 , accompanied by its diminution at the gene promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The enhancer blocking effects were completely attributable to the CTCF binding site in cHS4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These findings provide experimental evidence for the involvement of spreading in establishment of a broad zone of histone modification by an enhancer , as well as for blocking by an insulator of the transfer of RNA polymerase II from an enhancer to a promoter .</sentence>
