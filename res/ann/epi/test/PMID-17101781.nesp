<sentence id="0">Multiple factors affecting cellular redox status and energy metabolism modulate hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase activity in vivo and in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Prolyl hydroxylation of hypoxible-inducible factor alpha ( HIF-alpha ) proteins is essential for their recognition by pVHL containing ubiquitin ligase complexes and subsequent degradation in oxygen ( O(2))-replete cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Therefore , HIF prolyl hydroxylase ( PHD ) enzymatic activity is critical for the regulation of cellular responses to O(2) deprivation ( hypoxia ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Using a fusion protein containing the human HIF-1alpha O(2)-dependent degradation domain ( ODD ) , we monitored PHD activity both in vivo and in cell-free systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This novel assay allows the simultaneous detection of both hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated PHD substrates in cells and during in vitro reactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Importantly , the ODD fusion protein is regulated with kinetics identical to endogenous HIF-1alpha during cellular hypoxia and reoxygenation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Using in vitro assays , we demonstrated that the levels of iron ( Fe ) , ascorbate , and various tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle intermediates affect PHD activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The intracellular levels of these factors also modulate PHD function and HIF-1alpha accumulation in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , cells treated with mitochondrial inhibitors , such as rotenone and myxothiazol , provided direct evidence that PHDs remain active in hypoxic cells <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> functional mitochondria</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that multiple mitochondrial products , including TCA cycle intermediates and reactive oxygen species , can coordinate PHD activity , HIF stabilization , and cellular responses to O(2) depletion</scope> .</sentence>
