<sentence id="0">Differentially methylated forms of histone H3 show unique association patterns with inactive human X chromosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Studies of histone methylation have shown that H3 can be methylated at lysine 4 ( Lys4 ) or lysine 9 ( Lys9 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Whereas H3-Lys4 methylation has been correlated with active gene expression , H3-Lys9 methylation has been linked to gene silencing and assembly of heterochromatin in mouse and Schizosaccharomyces pombe .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The chromodomain of mouse HP1 ( and Swi6 in S. pombe ) binds H3 methylated at Lys9 , and methylation at this site is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to mark and promote heterochromatin assembly</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have used a well-studied model of mammalian epigenetic silencing , the human inactive X chromosome , to show that enrichment for H3 methylated at Lys9 is also a distinguishing mark of facultative heterochromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , H3 methylated at Lys4 is depleted in the inactive X chromosome , except in three ' hot spots ' of enrichment along its length .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses further show that Lys9 methylation is associated with promoters of inactive genes , whereas Lys4 methylation is associated with active genes on the X chromosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data demonstrate that differential methylation at two distinct sites of the H3 amino terminus correlates with contrasting gene activities and <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be part of a ' histone code ' involved in establishing and maintaining facultative heterochromatin</scope> .</sentence>
