<sentence id="0">Human deoxyhypusine hydroxylase , an enzyme involved in regulating cell growth , activates O2 with a nonheme diiron center .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of hypusine containing eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A ( eIF5A ) , which plays an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recombinant human deoxyhypusine hydroxylase ( hDOHH ) has been reported to have oxygen- and iron-dependent activity , an estimated iron/holoprotein stoichiometry of 2 , and a visible band at 630 nm responsible for the blue color of the as-isolated protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">EPR , Mossbauer , and XAS spectroscopic results presented herein provide direct spectroscopic evidence that hDOHH has an antiferromagnetically coupled diiron center with histidines and carboxylates as <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> ligands</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> as <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> by mutagenesis experiments</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Resonance Raman experiments show that its blue chromophore arises from a (mu-1,2-peroxo)diiron(III ) center that forms in the reaction of the reduced enzyme with O2 , so the peroxo form of hDOHH is unusually stable .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Nevertheless we demonstrate that it can carry out the hydroxylation of the deoxyhypusine residue present in the elF5A substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Despite a <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lack</cue> of sequence similarity</scope> , hDOHH has a nonheme diiron active site that resembles both in structure and function those found in methane and toluene monooxygenases , bacterial and mammalian ribonucleotide reductases , and stearoyl acyl carrier protein Delta9-desaturase from plants , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that the oxygen-activating diiron motif is a solution arrived at by convergent evolution</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Notably , hDOHH is the only example thus far of a human hydroxylase with such a diiron active site .</sentence>
