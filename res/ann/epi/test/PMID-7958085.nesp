<sentence id="0">[ Recent progress in TSH receptor research--relationship of its structural characteristics to ligand binding , glycosylation and signal transduction ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Extensive mutagenesis studies of the long extracellular domain of the TSH receptor ( TSHR ) revealed important residues ( Cys-301 , Tyr-385 and Cys-390 ) for binding of TSH in its C-terminal region .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These two cysteines were postulated to form a disulfide bond catalyzed by TSH .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">On the other hand , binding sites of a thyroid stimulating antibody were located in the N-terminal region of the extracellular domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The long extracellular domain of the TSHR has 5 or 6 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> asparagine-linked glycosylation sites</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , only two sites are essential for the expression of a functional receptor among them .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although point mutation at residue 113 of the human TSHR lost TSH binding , the equivalent mutation of the rat TSHR did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">implying</cue> a difference in the significance of sugar chains among species</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">G protein interaction sites have recently been defined by mutagenesis studies .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , the details of how TSH binding to the long extracellular domain causes conformational change in the transmembrane domain remains to be elucidated .</sentence>
