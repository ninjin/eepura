<sentence id="0">Direct correlation between methylation status and expression of the human O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To assess the role of DNA cytosine methylation in the expression of the O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) gene , the methylation status of selected CpG-containing dinucleotides in and surrounding the coding regions of the gene were examined and correlated with steady state expression of MGMT mRNA in 13 human cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Additionally , tumor cells which exhibited very high levels of MGMT expression were chronically exposed to 5-azacytidine to assess the effects of changes in gene methylation on MGMT expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Results of these studies demonstrate that the degree of methylation of multiple MGMT gene regions correlates with gene expression , but in a direct rather than an inverse fashion , and that 5-azacytidine-induced demethylation of the MGMT gene correlates with a significant reduction , rather than induction , of MGMT steady-state mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> a unique , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potentially</cue> alterable</scope> methylation-related regulatory mechanism for the MGMT gene</scope> .</sentence>
