<sentence id="0">Methylation and silencing of the retinoic acid receptor-beta2 gene in breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : A growing body of evidence supports the hypotheses that the retinoic acid receptor beta2 ( RAR-beta2 ) gene is a tumor suppressor gene and that the chemopreventive effects of retinoids are due to induction of RAR-beta2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">RAR-beta2 expression is reduced in many malignant tumors , and we examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> methylation of RAR-beta2 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> be responsible for this silencing</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : RAR-beta2 expression was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis in eight breast cancer cell lines that were either treated with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and subsequently with all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> left untreated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing was used to determine the locations of 5-methylcytosines in the RAR-beta2 genes of three of these cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In 16 breast cancer biopsy specimens and non-neoplastic breast tissue , methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation status of RAR-beta2 , and , in 13 of the specimens , RT-PCR analysis was used to detect RAR-beta2 expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : Cell lines SK-BR-3 , T-47D , ZR-75-1 , and MCF7 exhibited expression of RAR-beta2 only after demethylation and treatment with ATRA .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The first exon expressed in the RAR-beta2 transcript was methylated in cell lines ZR-75-1 and SK-BR-3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Six breast cancer specimens showed methylation in the same region of the gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">No expression of RAR-beta2 was found in any grade III lesion .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">An inverse association between methylation and gene expression was found in all grade II lesions .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The RAR-beta2 gene from non-neoplastic breast tissue was unmethylated and expressed .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">CONCLUSIONS : Methylation of the RAR-beta2 gene <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be an initial step in breast carcinogenesis ; treatment of cancer patients with demethylating agents followed by retinoic acid <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> offer a new therapeutic modality</scope></scope> .</sentence>
