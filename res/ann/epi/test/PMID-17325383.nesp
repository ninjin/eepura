<sentence id="0">Abnormal prion protein in the pituitary in sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">By using high-sensitivity Western blotting and immunohistochemistry , pituitary glands from patients with sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( sCJD and vCJD , respectively ) were analysed for the presence of the protease-resistant form of the prion protein ( PrPres ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PrPres was detected in a greater proportion of vCJD pituitaries than sCJD pituitaries and was localized predominantly in the neurohypophysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">PrPres was also detected in a recurrent pituitary adenoma from an sCJD patient .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Immunohistochemical analysis showed sparse positive labelling , predominantly in folliculostellate cells , in vCJD and sCJD adenohypophyses .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The PrPres glycosylation pattern in the vCJD neurohypophyses showed a predominance of the unglycosylated band , which differed markedly from patterns found in all other vCJD tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The presence of PrPres in the pituitary of CJD patients at autopsy <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that human growth hormone-related iatrogenic CJD <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> have indeed resulted from infectivity in collected pituitaries rather than necessarily from contamination of pituitary pools by adjacent brain tissue</scope></scope> .</sentence>
