<sentence id="0">Differential expression of glucocorticoid receptor transcripts in major depressive disorder is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> epigenetically programmed</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis is one of the most consistent findings in major depressive disorder ( MDD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Impaired HPA feedback <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be due to the lower glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) or mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) levels in the forebrain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">GR levels are transcriptionally controlled by multiple untranslated alternative first exons , each with its own promoter providing a mechanism for tissue-specific fine-tuning of GR levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recently epigenetic methylation of these GR promoters was shown to modulate hippocampal GR levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we investigate in post-mortem brain tissues <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> in MDD HPA axis hyperactivity <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be due to epigenetic modulation of GR transcript variants</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Levels of GRalpha , GRbeta and GR-P transcripts were homogeneous throughout the limbic system , with GRalpha being the most abundant ( 83 % ) , followed by GR-P ( 5-6 % ) while GRbeta was barely detectable ( 0.02 % ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Among the alternative first exons , 1B and 1C were the most active , while 1E and 1J showed the lowest expression and transcript 1F expressed intermediate levels of about 1 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In MDD , total GR levels were unaltered , although GRalpha was decreased in the amygdala and cingulate gyrus ( p<0.05 ) ; transcripts containing exons 1B , 1C and 1F were lower , and 1D and1J were increased in some regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">NGFI-A , a transcription factor of exon 1F was down-regulated in the hippocampus of MDD patients ; concomitantly exon 1F expression was reduced .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Bisulphite sequencing of the alternative promoters showed low methylation levels in both MDD and control brains .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Promoter 1F was uniformly unmethylated , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="4">reduced 1F transcript levels are <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> linked to promoter methylation but to the observed dearth of NGFI-A</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Previous studies showed high methylation levels in the 1F promoter , associated with childhood abuse .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Provided our donors were <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> abused</scope> , our results <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggest</cue> that the pathomechanism of MDD is similar but nevertheless distinct from that of abuse victims , explaining the clinical similarity of both conditions and that susceptibility to depression <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">may</cue> be either predisposed by early trauma or developed independent of such a condition</scope></scope> .</sentence>
