<sentence id="0">Alteration of the kinetics of type I procollagen synthesis in human osteosarcoma cells by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The kinetics of type I procollagen synthesis in a human osteosarcoma cell line , MG 63 , were investigated after treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25-(OH)2 D3 ) , a hormonal inducer of phenotypic differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Pulse label and chase experiments demonstrated greatly enhanced production and more rapid reduction of intracellular procollagen molecules in the 1,25-(OH)2 D3-treated cells as compared to the nontreated case .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">After a chase for 1 h , labeled procollagen was reduced by nine-tenths in 1,25-(OH)2 D3-treated cells , while half of the radioactivity still remained in nontreated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The expression rate of type I collagen , which was examined by pulse label experiment , was elevated in association with an increase in the mRNA coding for the type I collagen alpha 1 chain by 1,25-(OH)2 D3 treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , the amount of intracellular procollagen present after 4 h continuous labeling was almost the same , independent of the 1,25-(OH)2 D3 treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , we conclude that <scope type="neg" id="0">strage of the molecule was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> affected</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results therefore <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> an increase in both the synthesis and secretion of type I collagen</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The 1,25-(OH)2 D3 treatment was also found to induce the alpha subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and to be associated with an elevated level of hydroxyproline in the procollagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Moreover , gelatinase B-resistant procollagen molecules , indicative of intracellular procollagen molecules in the stable triple helical form , were detected only in the 1,25-(OH)2 D3-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> more efficient proline hydroxylation is involved in rapid secretion of procollagen after hormone administration</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The present evidence points to posttranslational control of procollagen synthesis .</sentence>
