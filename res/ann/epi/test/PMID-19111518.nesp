<sentence id="0">Direct and continuous assay for prolyl 4-hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Prolyl 4-hydroxylase ( P4H ) is a nonheme iron dioxygenase that catalyzes the posttranslational hydroxylation of (2S)-proline ( Pro ) residues in protocollagen strands .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The resulting ( 2S , 4R ) -4-hydroxyproline ( Hyp ) residues are essential for the folding , secretion , and stability of the collagen triple helix .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">P4H uses alpha-ketoglutarate and O2 as cosubstrates , and forms succinate and CO2 as well as Hyp .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Described herein is the first assay for P4H that continuously and directly detects turnover of the proline-containing substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This assay is based on ( 2S , 4S ) -4-fluoroproline ( flp ) , a proline analogue that is transformed into (2S)-4-ketoproline ( Kep ) and inorganic fluoride by P4H .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The fluoride ion , and thus turnover by P4H , is detected by a fluoride ion-selective electrode .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Using this assay , steady-state kinetic parameters for the human P4H-catalyzed turnover of a flp-containing peptide were determined and found to be comparable to those obtained with a discontinuous HPLC-based assay .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , this assay can be used to characterize P4H variants , as demonstrated by a comparison of catalysis by D414A P4H and the wild-type enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Finally , the use of the assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors of P4H was verified by an analysis of catalysis in the presence of 2,4-pyridine dicarboxylate , an analogue of alpha-ketoglutarate .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Thus , the assay described herein could facilitate biochemical analyses of this essential enzyme .</sentence>
