<sentence id="0">GSK3beta affects apical-basal polarity and cell-cell adhesion by regulating aPKC levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The dynamic rearrangement of cell-cell contacts is required for the establishment of functional epithelial cell sheets .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms that initiate and maintain this polarity are <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> well understood</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that loss of the Wnt signaling component GSK3 beta results in increased levels of aPKC and leads to defects in apical-basal polarity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We find that GSK3 beta directly phosphorylates aPKC , which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">aPKC increases the levels of Armadillo and stabilizes adherens junctions .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the Wnt pathway component GSK3 beta regulates the polarity determinant aPKC , which in turn affects cell-cell contacts during the development of polarized tissues</scope> .</sentence>
