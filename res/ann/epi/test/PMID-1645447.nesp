<sentence id="0">Nur77 is differentially modified in PC12 cells upon membrane depolarization and growth factor treatment .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 can be induced by growth factors to undergo proliferation and neuronal differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These cells also have excitable membranes that can be depolarized by neurotransmitters or elevated levels of extracellular KCl .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Treatment of PC12 cells with growth factors or membrane-depolarizing agents rapidly activates the expression of specific genes whose products are <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to mediate the subsequent biological responses</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One such gene , nur77 , is a member of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor gene superfamily .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We have identified the Nur77 protein and shown that it is synthesized rapidly and transiently in PC12 cells following stimulation , has a short half-life of 30 to 40 min , and is located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Nur77 is posttranslationally modified , primarily by phosphorylation on serine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Phosphopeptide analysis reveals that Nur77 is modified differently upon membrane depolarization than after treatment with growth factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">hypothesize</cue> that the activity of Nur77 is regulated by both differential gene expression and posttranslational modification and that these modes of regulation contribute to distinct downstream responses specific to membrane depolarization and growth factor treatment</scope> .</sentence>
