<sentence id="0">Down-regulation of Sp1 activity through modulation of O-glycosylation by treatment with a low glucose mimetic , 2-deoxyglucose .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">2-Deoxyglucose ( 2-DG ) , a nonmetabolizable glucose analogue , blocks glycolysis at the phosphohexose isomerase step and has been frequently used as a glucose starvation mimetic in studies of a wide variety of physiological dysfuctions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , <scope type="neg" id="0">the effect of 2-DG on protein glycosylation and related signal pathways has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been investigated in depth</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In HeLa , an HPV18-positive cervical carcinoma line , 2-DG treatment down-regulates human papillomavirus early gene transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This down-regulation was also achieved by low glucose supply or hypoxia , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that this is a response commonly modulated by cellular glucose or energy level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We investigated how 2-DG and low glucose affect transcriptional activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Human papillomavirus gene transcription was only marginally affected by the inhibition of ATP synthesis or the supplementation of pyruvate to 2-DG-treated cells , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that poor ATP generation is involved only to a limited extent</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">2-DG treatment also inhibited activation of p21 WAF1 promoter , which is controlled by p53 and/or Sp1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In a reporter assay using p21 WAF1 promoter constructs , 2-DG exerted a strong inhibitory effect on Sp1 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">DNA binding activity of Sp1 in 2-DG-treated HeLa cells was intact , whereas it was severely impaired in cells incubated in a low glucose medium or in hypoxic condition .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Unexpectedly , Sp1 was heavily modified with GlcNAc in 2-DG-treated cells , which is at least partially attributed to the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Our results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that 2-DG , like low glucose or hypoxic condition , down-regulates Sp1 activity , but through hyper-GlcNAcylation <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">instead of</cue> hypo-GlcNAcylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
