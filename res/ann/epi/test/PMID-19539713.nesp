<sentence id="3">To investigate the effect of nicotinamide-mediated TH regulation in vivo , nicotinamide was chronically injected into neonatal mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , nicotinamide-treated mice were smaller in size , and their locomotor activity was reduced .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">L-DOPA treatment caused hypersensitive locomotor activity that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates</cue> a dopamine-depleted state</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="2"> These changes <cue type="spec" id="2">seemed</cue> to be associated with dopamine metabolism in hypothalamus</scope> , since dopamine in hypothalamus was reduced but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in striatum</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The present study <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> that the regulation of dopamine metabolism during the postnatal development is important and <scope type="spec" id="4"> the underlying molecular mechanisms <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> be associated with SIRT1 signaling</scope></scope> .</sentence>
