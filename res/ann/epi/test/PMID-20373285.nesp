<sentence id="0">Long intronic GAA repeats causing Friedreich ataxia impede transcription elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Friedreich ataxia is a degenerative disease caused by deficiency of the protein frataxin ( FXN ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">An intronic expansion of GAA triplets in the FXN-encoding gene , FXN , causes gene silencing and thus reduced FXN protein levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although it is widely <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">assumed</cue> that GAA repeats block transcription via the assembly of an inaccessible chromatin structure marked by methylated H3K9 , direct proof for this is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we analysed different histone modification patterns along the human FXN gene in FRDA patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that FXN mRNA synthesis , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> turnover rates are affected by an expanded GAA repeat tract</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Importantly , <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">rather than</cue> preventing transcription initiation</scope> , long GAA repeat tracts affect transcription at the elongation step and this can occur independently of H3K9 methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our data demonstrate that finding novel strategies to overcome the transcription elongation problem <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> develop into promising new treatments for FRDA</scope> .</sentence>
