<sentence id="4">Prolyl hydroxylation leads to pVHL ( von-Hippel-Lindau protein ) -dependent ubiquitination and rapid proteasomal degradation of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the present study , we report that human PHD2 and PHD3 are induced by hypoxia in primary and transformed cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In the human osteosarcoma cell line , U2OS , selective suppression of HIF-1alpha expression by RNA interference resulted in a complete loss of hypoxic induction of PHD2 and PHD3 .</sentence>
