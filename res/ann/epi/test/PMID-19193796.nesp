<sentence id="0">O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation of Sp1 inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) gene expression and replication are regulated by the promoter/enhancer located in the U3 region of the proviral 5' long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The binding of cellular transcription factors to specific regulatory sites in the 5' LTR is a key event in the replication cycle of HIV-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Since transcriptional activity is regulated by the posttranslational modification of transcription factors with the monosaccharide O-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) , we evaluated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> increased O-GlcNAcylation affects HIV-1 transcription</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present study we demonstrate that treatment of HIV-1-infected lymphocytes with the O-GlcNAcylation-enhancing agent glucosamine ( GlcN ) repressed viral transcription in a dose-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Overexpression of O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) , the sole known enzyme catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins , specifically inhibited the activity of the HIV-1 LTR promoter in different T-cell lines and in primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inhibition of HIV-1 LTR activity in infected T cells was most efficient ( > 95 % ) when OGT was recombinantly overexpressed prior to infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">O-GlcNAcylation of the transcription factor Sp1 and the presence of Sp1-binding sites in the LTR were found to be crucial for this inhibitory effect .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">From this study , we conclude that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 LTR promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Modulation of Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play a role in the regulation of HIV-1 latency and activation and links viral replication to the glucose metabolism of the host cell</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Hence , the establishment of a metabolic treatment <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> supplement the repertoire of antiretroviral therapies against AIDS</scope> .</sentence>
