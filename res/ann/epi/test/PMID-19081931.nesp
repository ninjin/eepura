<sentence id="0">Asparagine beta-hydroxylation stabilizes the ankyrin repeat domain fold .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ankyrin repeats ( ARs ) are one of the most common structural motifs among eukaryotic proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recent analyses have shown that factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor ( FIH ) catalyses the hydroxylation of highly conserved Asn-residues within ankyrin repeat domains ( ARDs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the effect of Asn-hydroxylation on ARD structure is unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Supporting the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">proposal</cue> that FIH-mediated ARD hydroxylation is ubiquitous</scope> we report that consensus ARD proteins are FIH substrates both in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that hydroxylation does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> alter the archetypical ARD conformation in the crystalline state</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , other biophysical analyses revealed that hydroxylation significantly stabilizes the ARD fold in solution .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> that intracellular protein hydroxylation is much more common than previously thought and that one of its roles is stabilization of localized regions of ARD folds</scope> .</sentence>
