<sentence id="0">Processing of CD109 by furin and its role in the regulation of TGF-beta signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">CD109 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein , whose expression is upregulated in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung , esophagus , uterus and oral cavity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CD109 negatively regulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling in keratinocytes by directly modulating receptor activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we further characterized CD109 regulation of TGF-beta signaling and cell proliferation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that CD109 is produced as a 205 kDa glycoprotein , which is then processed in the Golgi apparatus into 180 kDa and 25 kDa proteins by furin ( furinase ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">180 kDa CD109 associated with GPI-anchored 25 kDa CD109 on the cell surface and was also secreted into the culture medium .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">To investigate <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> furinase cleavage of CD109 is necessary for its biological activity</scope> , we mutated arginine 1273 in the CD109 furinase cleavage motif ( amino acid 1270-RRRR-1273 ) to serine ( R1273S ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Interestingly , CD109 R1273S <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">neither</cue> significantly impaired TGF-beta signaling <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">nor</cue> affected TGF-beta-mediated suppression of cell growth</scope></scope> , although it was expressed on the cell surface as a 205 kDa protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Consistent with this finding , the 180 kDa and 25 kDa CD109 complex , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> CD109 R1273S</scope> , associated with the type I TGF-beta receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> processing of CD109 into 180 kDa and 25 kDa proteins by furin , followed by complex formation with the type I TGF-beta receptor is required for the regulation of TGF-beta signaling in cancer cells and keratinocytes</scope> .</sentence>
