T1009	Span 1228 1563	indicating that IgE-BF are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the 37-kDa molecule, previously identified as a membrane component of Fc epsilon R. On incubation with N-glycosylation inhibitors, the production of IgE-BF is significantly increased indicating that N-glycosylation inhibits the degradation of Fc epsilon R into IgE-BF
