<sentence id="1">The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI is an inherited disorder of collagen metabolism characterized by a defective lysyl hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The resulting <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of hydroxylysine</scope> has been found in several connective tissues , all of which show varying degrees of clinical symptoms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the present study , collagen was isolated from different connective tissues and the degree of hydroxylation of lysyl residues was determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Subsequently , collagen types I , II , III , IV , and V have been prepared from a number of tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Insufficient hydroxylation of lysyl residues was found in type I and type III collagen , whereas types II , IV , and V showed normal amounts of hydroxylysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The expression of the defect , even for type I and type III collagen , varied widely from one tissue to another .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A complete <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lack</cue> of hydroxylysine</scope> was observed in skin , while it was less pronounced in tissues such as bone , tendon , lung , or kidney .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> the presence of several isoenzymes having varying affinities to the different collagen types</scope> .</sentence>
