<sentence id="0">Mechanism of attenuation of angiotensin-II-induced protein degradation by insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) has been shown to attenuate protein degradation in murine myotubes induced by angiotensin II through downregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , although <scope type="spec" id="0"> the mechanism is <cue type="spec" id="0">not known</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Angiotensin II is known to upregulate this pathway through a cellular signalling mechanism involving release of arachidonic acid , activation of protein kinase Calpha ( PKCalpha ) , degradation of inhibitor-kappaB ( I-kappaB ) and nuclear migration of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , and all of these events were attenuated by IGF-I ( 13.2 nM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been linked to activation of the RNA-activated protein kinase ( PKR ) , since an inhibitor of PKR attenuated proteasome expression and activity in response to angiotensin II and prevented the decrease in the myofibrillar protein myosin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Angiotensin II induced phosphorylation of PKR and of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 ( eIF2 ) on the alpha-subunit , and this was attenuated by IGF-I , by induction of the expression of protein phosphatase 1 , which dephosphorylates PKR .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Release of arachidonic acid and activation of PKCalpha by angiotensin II were attenuated by an inhibitor of PKR and IGF-I , and the effect was reversed by Salubrinal ( 15 muM ) , an inhibitor of eIF2alpha dephosphorylation , as was activation of PKCalpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition myotubes transfected with a dominant-negative PKR ( PKRDelta6 ) showed <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> release of arachidonate in response to Ang II</scope> , and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> activation of PKCalpha</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that phosphorylation of PKR by angiotensin II was responsible for the activation of the PLA(2)/PKC pathway leading to activation of NF-kappaB and that IGF-I attenuates protein degradation due to an inhibitory effect on activation of PKR</scope> .</sentence>
