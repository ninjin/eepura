<sentence id="0">The glutamine residue of the conserved GGQ motif in Saccharomyces cerevisiae release factor eRF1 is methylated by the product of the YDR140w gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Polypeptide release factors from eubacteria and eukaryotes , although similar in function , belong to different protein families .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">They share one sequence motif , a GGQ tripeptide that is vital to release factor ( RF ) activity in both kingdoms .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In bacteria , the Gln residue of the motif in RF1 and RF2 is modified to N(5)-methyl-Gln by the S-adenosyl l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase PrmC and the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of Gln methylation</scope> decreases the release activity of Escherichia coli RF2 in vitro severalfold .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show here that the same modification is made to the GGQ motif of Saccharomyces cerevisiae release factor eRF1 , the first time that N(5)-methyl-Gln has been found outside the bacterial kingdom .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The product of the YDR140w gene is required for the methylation of eRF1 in vivo and for optimal yeast cell growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">YDR140w protein has significant homology to PrmC but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> the N-terminal domain <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">thought</cue> to be involved in the recognition of the bacterial release factors</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Overproduced in S. cerevisiae , YDR140w can methylate eRF1 from yeast or man in vitro using S-adenosyl l-methionine as methyl donor provided that eRF3 and GTP are also present , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that the natural substrate of the methyltransferase YDR140w is the ternary complex eRF1.eRF3.GTP</scope> .</sentence>
