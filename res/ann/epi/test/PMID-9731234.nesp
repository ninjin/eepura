<sentence id="0">Fine structural and functional consequences of deglycosylation of the platelet adhesion receptor GPIb-IX ( CD 42b ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To investigate the role of the glycosylation of the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib ( GPIb , CD 42b ) , platelets and purified GPIb were deglycosylated by neuraminidase , O- and N-glycosidases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">N-deglycosylation and neuraminic-acid cleavage had little effect on ristocetin and botrocetin-induced platelet agglutination .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , O-deglycosylation reduced the response by approximately 50 % , and total deglycosylation ( the combination of all three glycosidases ) fully abolished the response to ristocetin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Interestingly , <scope type="neg" id="0">binding of von Willebrand Factor ( vWF ) to purified GPIb in the presence of ristocetin and botrocetin in a standardized microtiter plate assay was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> altered by partial or even by total deglycosylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Electron microscopy <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> the normally stretched approximately 50 nm long molecule was approximately 32 nm after N-deglycosylation , approximately 20 nm after O-deglycosylation , and reduced in a approximately 15 nm long collapse by total deglycosylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that deglycosylation has major structural impacts on GPIb , strongly impairing platelet-vWF interactions</scope> ; however , vWF binding to isolated GPIb remains unaffected .</sentence>
