N-Hydroxy-amide analogues of MHC-class I peptide ligands with nanomolar binding affinities. 
A novel class of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) ligands containing an N-hydroxyamide bond was designed on the basis of the natural epitope SIINFEKL, and synthesized on solid phase. The capacity of these compounds to bind to the MHC-I molecule H-2Kb and to induce T cell responses was analysed in comparison with the corresponding glycine containing variant of SIINFEKL. Binding to the MHC molecule was diminished by the N-hydroxy group at positions 2 and 3 of the oligomer and improved in the case of positions 4, 5, 6 and 7. No change was seen for position 1. The efficacy of T cell stimulation was strongly reduced by the modification of all positions except for position 1. A complete loss of activity was found for the N-hydroxy variant in positions 4 and 6. N-Hydroxy amide-containing peptides displayed an enhanced stability to enzymatic degradation. This new class of MHC ligand can become instrumental as immunomodulatory reagent in various disease situations.
