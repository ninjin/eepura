<sentence id="0">An axial gradient of transgene methylation in murine skeletal muscle : genomic imprint of rostrocaudal position .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We previously used mice bearing a myosin light chain-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( MLC1-CAT ) transgene to show that adult muscle cells bear a heritable , cell autonomous memory of their rostrocaudal position .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CAT mRNA and protein are expressed in a > 100-fold rostrocaudal gradient in skeletal muscles of developing and adult MLC1-CAT mice ( Donoghue , M. J. , Merlie , J. P. , Rosenthal , N. and Sanes , J. R. ( 1991 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 , 5847-5851 ; Donoghue , M. J. , Alvarez , J. D. , Merlie , J. P. and Sanes , J. R. ( 1991 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">J. Cell Biol. 115 , 423-434 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , both in primary cultures and in myogenic cell lines prepared from individual muscles of these mice , CAT levels reflect the body position from which the myoblasts were derived ( Donoghue , M.J. , Morris-Valero , R. , Johnson , Y.R. , Merlie , J.P. and Sanes , J. R. ( 1992 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cell 69 , 67-77 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Here , we show that the methylation state of the MLC1-CAT transgene in skeletal muscles is also graded along the rostrocaudal axis : methylation levels decrease and expression levels increase in the order , jaw-->neck-->chest and forelimb-->hindlimb .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Methylation levels are also approx .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">10-fold higher in rostrally derived than in caudally derived myogenic cell lines , which express low and high levels of CAT , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Within each cell line , undifferentiated cells ( myoblasts ) , which do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> express the transgene</scope> , and differentiated cells ( myotubes ) , which do , are indistinguishable in methylation state .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Thus , differentiation-related changes in transgene expression do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect position-related levels of transgene methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">On the other hand , treatment of rostrally derived lines with the demethylating agent , 5-azacytidine , decreases methylation and increases expression of the transgene .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Thus , perturbation of methylation affects expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that methylation provides a genomic imprint of rostrocaudal body position that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> serve as a component of the positional memory that mammalian cells retain into adulthood</scope></scope> .</sentence>
