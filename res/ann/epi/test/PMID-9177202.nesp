<sentence id="0">Site-specific de-N-glycosylation of diglycosylated ovalbumin in hen oviduct by endogenous peptide : N-glycanase as a quality control system for newly synthesized proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hen ovalbumin ( OVA ) is known to exist as a singly N-glycosylated form with a glycan chain on Asn-292 in egg white .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies showed that di-N-glycosylated form of OVA [ Di-OVA ; CHO-Asn-292/CHO-Asn-311 ( CHO , N-glycan chain ) ] , which has two N-glycan chains on Asn-292 and Asn-311 , was expressed only transiently in hen oviduct .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0">Di-OVA was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> found in egg white</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that this form cannot be secreted normally and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possibly</cue> be converted to mono-N-glycosylated OVA ( CHO-Asn-292/Asp-311 ) by the action of peptide:N-glycanase ( PNGase ) during synthesis and secretion</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we have identified the <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">putative</cue> PNGase activity</scope> in the homogenate of hen oviduct , purified 1,000-fold , and designated as PNGase HO .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We examined the reactivity of Di-OVA to PNGase HO and found that this enzyme site-specifically cleaved off the glycan chain at Asn-311 to convert Di-OVA into the mono-N-glycosylated form ( CHO-Asn-292/Asp-311 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In contrast , this enzyme was found <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> to act on the mono-N-glycosylated OVA ( CHO-Asn-292/Asn-311 ) found in egg white when it was tested as a substrate</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The present findings support our view that de-N-glycosylation catalyzed by PNGase <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> be involved in quality control of newly synthesized proteins by converting its diglycosylated form into the mono-N-glycosylated form that can be secreted</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , the alternative <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">possibility</cue> that de-N-glycosylation <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">may</cue> trigger cytosolic degradation of the aberrantly glycosylated glycoprotein</scope></scope> cannot be ruled out .</sentence>
