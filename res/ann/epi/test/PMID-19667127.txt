Histone H2BK123 monoubiquitination is the critical determinant for H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation by COMPASS and Dot1. 
Histone H2B monoubiquitination by Rad6/Bre1 is required for the trimethylation of both histone H3K4 and H3K79 by COMPASS and Dot1 methyltransferases, respectively. The dependency of methylation at H3K4 and H3K79 on the monoubiquitination of H2BK123 was recently challenged, and extragenic mutations in the strain background used for previous studies or epitope-tagged proteins were suggested to be the sources of this discrepancy. In this study, we show that H3K4 and H3K79 methylation is solely dependent on H2B monoubiquitination regardless of any additional alteration to the H2B sequence or genome. Furthermore, we report that Y131, one of the yeast histone H2A/H2B shuffle strains widely used for the last decade in the field of chromatin and transcription biology, carries a wild-type copy of each of the HTA2 and HTB2 genes under the GAL1/10 promoter on chromosome II. Therefore, we generated the entire histone H2A and H2B alanine-scanning mutant strains in another background, which does not express wild-type histones.
