<sentence id="0">Role of glycosylation for beta 2-adrenoceptor function in A431 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A431 cells incubated with tunicamycin ( 0.15 micrograms/ml ) for 40 h under conditions where incorporation of [ 3H ] leucine into protein was inhibited less than 10 % expressed mainly a beta-receptor species of about Mr 40,000 which was ascribed to the nonglycosylated form of the beta-receptor of about Mr 75,000 found in normal A431 cells by photoaffinity labeling .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the tunicamycin-treated cells expressed the same number of specific beta 2-receptor-binding sites as untreated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Moreover , the aglycoreceptors had the same ligand binding properties as beta-adrenoceptors from control cells ; but , functional tests of the receptor from tunicamycin-treated cells in reconstituted lipid vesicles showed that receptors from tunicamycin-treated cells had lost coupling efficiency .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The coupling defect was at the receptor level since control experiments <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> the other components of the signal transmission chain from beta-adrenoceptor to adenylate cyclase , the stimulatory regulatory GTP-binding protein of adenylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase , were fully functional</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Homologous desensitization in tunicamycin-treated cells was characterized by export from the cell surface and sequestration of about the same number of beta-adrenoceptors as in normal desensitized cells but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> further reduction of hormonally stimulated adenylate cyclase</scope> below the low level already attained in nondesensitized tunicamycin-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This was explained by assuming that the receptors removed in the course of homologous desensitization from the surface of tunicamycin-treated cells were already nonfunctional .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , beta-adrenergic desensitization in tunicamycin-treated cells is characterized by the functional disengagement of receptor removal and loss of adenylate cyclase activity .</sentence>
