The intramolecular autoglucosylation of monomeric glycogenin. 
The ability of monomeric glycogenin to autoglucosylate by an intramolecular mechanism of reaction is described using non-glucosylated and partially glucosylated recombinant glycogenin. We determined that monomer glycogenin exists in solution at concentration below 0.60-0.85 microM. The specific autoglucosylation rate of non-glucosylated and glucosylated monomeric glycogenin represented 50 and 70% of the specific rate of the corresponding dimeric glycogenin species. The incorporation of a unique sugar unit into the tyrosine hydroxyl group of non-glucosylated glycogenin, analyzed by autoxylosylation, occurred at a lower rate than the incorporation into the glucose hydroxyl group of the glucosylated enzyme. The intramonomer autoglucosylation mechanism here described for the first time, confers to a just synthesized glycogenin molecule the capacity to produce maltosaccharide primer for glycogen synthase, without the need to reach the concentration required for association into the more efficient autoglucosylating dimer. The monomeric and dimeric interconversion determining the different autoglucosylation rate, might serve as a modulation mechanism for the de novo biosynthesis of glycogen at the initial glucose polymerization step.
