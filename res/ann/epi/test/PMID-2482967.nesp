<sentence id="0">Demethylation of the gene expressing a yolk protein precursor in quail .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Japanese quail produce more egg-yolk protein per gram of body weight than chickens do .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because cytosine phosphoguanine ( CpG ) methylation has been reported to correlate inversely with gene activity , the demethylation of cytosine residues in the quail vitellogenin 2 ( Vg2 ) gene was assessed as a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> contributing factor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Vitellogenin genes are normally transcribed in the liver of female Japanese quail that are sexually mature .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Changes in the methylation pattern of CCGG sites of the quail Vg2 gene were studied using the methyl-sensitive restriction endonucleases Msp I and Hpa II .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">At least five CCGG sites were detected within the transcribed region of the Vg2 gene ; one or two of these sites were hypomethylated in all tissues examined in male and female quail , two sites underwent transcription-dependent demethylation in the liver of laying females and also in the liver of males following estradiol injection ( 64 mumol estradiol/mL of absolute ethanol at .25 mL/100 g of BW ) , and another site was demethylated in the liver of estradiol-injected males but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in laying females</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Two further sites present within the 5' flanking sequences or 5' structural region underwent transcription-dependent demethylation in the liver of laying females and of estradiol-treated males ; <scope type="spec" id="2"> one or both of these sites <cue type="spec" id="2">appears</cue> to be demethylated in the oviduct</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Another site , within the 3' flanking sequences or the 3' structural gene region , underwent estradiol-dependent demethylation in the liver and the oviduct .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The expression-linked demethylation of the CCGG sites in the Vg2 gene of quail <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to be similar to that reported for the chicken VTGII gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The results of this study did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> explain the enhanced production of yolk protein in Japanese quail</scope> , but did <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> the presence of a fundamental , conserved mechanism that must play an important role in the expression of the avian Vg gene</scope> .</sentence>
