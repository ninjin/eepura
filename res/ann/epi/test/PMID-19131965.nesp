<sentence id="0">The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 requires RNF11 to downregulate NF-kappaB signalling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The RING domain protein RNF11 is overexpressed in breast cancers and promotes tumour growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) signalling .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">RNF11 has been proposed to regulate TGF-beta signalling by interacting with HECT- and SCF-type E3 ligases ; however , the role of RNF11 in other signalling pathways is poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we demonstrate a novel function of RNF11 as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB and jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signalling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Knockdown of RNF11 with siRNA resulted in persistent tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated NF-kappaB and JNK signalling .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RNF11 interacted with the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20 and its regulatory protein TAX1BP1 in a stimulus-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RNF11 negatively regulated RIP1 and TRAF6 ubiquitination upon stimulation with TNF and LPS , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , RNF11 was required for A20 to interact with and inactivate RIP1 to inhibit TNF-mediated NF-kappaB activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our studies reveal that RNF11 , together with TAX1BP1 and Itch , is an essential component of an A20 ubiquitin-editing protein complex that ensures transient activation of inflammatory signalling pathways .</sentence>
