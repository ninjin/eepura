<sentence id="0">Smurf2 induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Smurf1 to prevent migration of breast cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is involved in various biological processes , and accumulating evidence <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in cancer development</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 ( Smurf1 ) and Smurf2 are E3 ubiquitin ligases , which suppress transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) family signaling through degradation of Smads and receptors for TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In addition , Smurf1 has been reported to promote RhoA ubiquitination and degradation and regulate cell motility , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> the involvement of Smurf1 in cancer progression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , the regulation and biological function of Smurf1 and Smurf2 in cancer development remain to be elucidated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In the present study , we show the post-translational regulation of Smurf1 by Smurf2 and the functional differences between Smurf1 and Smurf2 in the progression of breast cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Smurf2 interacted with Smurf1 and induced its ubiquitination and degradation , whereas Smurf1 <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">failed</cue> to induce degradation of Smurf2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Knockdown of Smurf2 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in increases in the levels of Smurf1 protein , and enhancement of cell migration in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Of note , knockdown of Smurf1 , but <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> of Smurf2</scope> , enhanced TGF-beta signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that increased an protein level of Smurf1</scope> offsets the effect of Smurf2 knockdown on TGF-beta signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> two related E3 ubiquitin ligases , Smurf1 and Smurf2 , act in the same direction in TGF-beta family signaling</scope> but play opposite roles in cell migration .</sentence>
