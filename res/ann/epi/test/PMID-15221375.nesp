<sentence id="1">Endometrial carcinomas are the most common malignancy of the female genital tract and the third most common cancer in women .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Progesterone and oestrogen receptors ( PRs , ERs ) are the most widely documented prognostic and predictive factors in endometrioid adenocarcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Besides the hormonal pathway involved in the progression of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions , alterations of the DNA methylation status have been shown to be an early signal of tumorigenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we show that in normal endometrium , during the proliferative phase , DNA methylation and PR expression are high , with a significant decline towards the end of the secretory phase and a gradual increase in non-atypical and atypical endometrial hyperplasia ; they reach their highest level in grade I , then decrease significantly in grade-II and grade-III endometrioid adenocarcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">During each stage , a significant positive correlation is observed between DNA methylation and PR ( P<0.0001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The strong parallelism between DNA methylation and PR expression precludes establishing a precise determination regarding the timing of these events , clearly involved in the genesis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma .</sentence>
