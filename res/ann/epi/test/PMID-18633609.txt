Characterization of an alpha-L-rhamnosidase from Aspergillus kawachii and its gene. 
An alpha-L-rhamnosidase was purified by fractionating a culture filtrate of Aspergillus kawachii grown on L-rhamnose as the sole carbon source. The alpha-L-rhamnosidase had a molecular mass of 90 kDa and a high degree of N-glycosylation of approximately 22%. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 4.0 and temperature of 50 degrees C. Further, it was observed to be thermostable, and it retained more than 80% of its original activity following incubation at 60 degrees C for 1 h. Its T (50) value was determined to be 72 degrees C. The enzyme was able to hydrolyze alpha-1,2- and alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds. The specific activity of the enzyme was higher toward naringin than toward hesperidin. The A. kawachii alpha-L-rhamnosidase-encoding gene (Ak-rhaA) codes for a 655-amino-acid protein. Based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA, the protein possessed 13 potential N-glycosylation recognition sites and exhibited a high degree of sequence identity (up to 75%) with the alpha-L-rhamnosidases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 78 from Aspergillus aculeatus and with hypothetical Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus fumigatus proteins.
