<sentence id="0">The neutralizing activity of anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies is modulated by specific glycans on the E2 envelope protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) envelope glycoproteins are highly glycosylated , with up to 5 and 11 N-linked glycans on E1 and E2 , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Most of the glycosylation sites on HCV envelope glycoproteins are conserved , and some of the glycans associated with these proteins have been shown to play an essential role in protein folding and HCV entry .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Such a high level of glycosylation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that these glycans can limit the immunogenicity of HCV envelope proteins and restrict the binding of some antibodies to their epitopes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> these glycans can modulate the neutralizing activity of anti-HCV antibodies</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">HCV pseudoparticles ( HCVpp ) bearing wild-type glycoproteins or mutants at individual glycosylation sites were <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">evaluated for</cue> their sensitivity to neutralization by antibodies from the sera of infected patients and anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">While we did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> find any evidence that N-linked glycans of E1 contribute to the masking of neutralizing epitopes</scope> , our data demonstrate that at least three glycans on E2 ( denoted E2N1 , E2N6 , and E2N11 ) reduce the sensitivity of HCVpp to antibody neutralization .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Importantly , these three glycans also reduced the access of CD81 to its E2 binding site , as shown by using a soluble form of the extracellular loop of CD81 in inhibition of entry .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that glycans E2N1 , E2N6 , and E2N11 are close to the binding site of CD81</scope> and modulate both CD81 and neutralizing antibody binding to E2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In conclusion , this work <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicates that</cue> HCV glycans contribute to the evasion of HCV from the humoral immune response</scope> .</sentence>
