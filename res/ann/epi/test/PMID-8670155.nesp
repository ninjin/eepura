<sentence id="0">Entry of polyunsaturated fatty acids into the brain : evidence that high-density lipoprotein-induced methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine and phospholipase A2 are involved .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) into phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) by a sequence of three transmethylation reactions is shown to be stimulated by the apolipoprotein E-free subclass of high-density lipoprotein ( HDL3 ) in isolated bovine brain capillary ( BBC ) membranes , HDL3-induced stimulation of BBC membranes pulsed with [methyl-14C]methionine causes a transient increase in each methylated phospholipid , i.e. phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine ( PMME ) , phosphatidyl-NN-dimethylethanolamine ( PDME ) and PC .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PC substrate arising from the activation of PE N-methyltransferase ( PEMT ) is hydrolysed by a phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) , as demonstrated by the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine ( lyso-PC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">When PE containing [14C]arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position ( [ 14C]PAPE ) is incorporated into BBC membranes , HDL3 stimulation induces the formation of PMME , PDME , PC and lyso-PC and the release of [14C]arachidonic acid , which correlates with the previous production of lyso-PC , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that HDL3 stimulates a PLA2 that can release polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both PEMT and PLA2 activities depend on a HDL3 concentration in the range 0-50 micrograms/ml and are strictly dependent on HDL3 binding , because HDL3 modified by tetranitromethane is no longer able to bind to specific receptors and to trigger PEMT and PLA2 activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , HDL3 prelabelled with [14C]PAPE can stimulate PDME and lyso-PC synthesis in BBC membranes in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that HDL3 can supply BBC membranes in polyunsaturated PE and <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">can</cue> activate enzymes involved in PE N-methylation and PUFA release</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results support the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesis</cue> of a close relationship between HDL3 binding , PE methylation and PUFA release</scope> , and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that the PC pool arising from PE <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> be used as a pathway for the supply of PUFA to the brain</scope></scope> .</sentence>
