<sentence id="0">Ubc4/5 and c-Cbl continue to ubiquitinate EGF receptor after internalization to facilitate polyubiquitination and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">c-Cbl is the E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor ( EGFR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">On the basis of localization , knockdown , and in vitro activity analyses , we have identified the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that cooperates with c-Cbl as Ubc4/5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Upon EGF stimulation , both Ubc4/5 and c-Cbl were relocated to the plasma membrane and then to Hrs-positive endosomes , strongly <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that EGFR continues to be ubiquitinated after internalization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our time-course experiment showed that EGFR undergoes polyubiquitination , <scope type="spec" id="1"> which <cue type="spec" id="1">seemed</cue> to be facilitated during the transport to Hrs-positive endosomes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Use of a conjugation-defective ubiquitin mutant <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that receptor polyubiquitination is required for efficient interaction with Hrs and subsequent sorting to lysosomes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Abrupt inhibition of the EGFR kinase activity resulted in dissociation of c-Cbl from EGFR .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Concomitantly , EGFR was rapidly deubiquitinated and its degradation was delayed .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR facilitates its polyubiquitination in endosomes and counteracts rapid deubiquitination , thereby ensuring Hrs-dependent lysosomal sorting</scope> .</sentence>
