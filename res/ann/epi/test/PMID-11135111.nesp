<sentence id="0">Carboxyl-methylation of prenylated calmodulin CaM53 is required for efficient plasma membrane targeting of the protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Prenylation is necessary for association of the petunia calmodulin CaM53 with the plasma membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> post-prenylation processing of the protein was also required for plasma membrane targeting</scope> , we studied the subcellular localization of a GFP-labelled CaM53 reporter in yeast and plant cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Blocking of carboxyl-methylation of prenylated proteins either by a specific inhibitor or in mutant yeast cells resulted in <scope type="spec" id="1"> localization of green fluorescence to what <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to be the endomembrane system , in contrast with the plasma membrane localization observed in control cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that a prenyl-cysteine methyltransferase ( PCM ) activity that carboxyl-methylates prenylated CaM53 also exists in plant cells , and that it is required for efficient plasma membrane targeting .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also report an Arabidopsis gene with homology to PCM and demonstrate that it encodes a protein with PCM activity that localizes to the endomembrane system of plant cells , similar to prenylated but unmethylated CaM53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Together , our data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that , following prenylation , <scope type="spec" id="3"> CaM53 is <cue type="spec" id="3">probably</cue> associated with the endomembrane system , where a PCM activity methylates the prenylated protein prior to targeting it to its final destination in the plasma membrane</scope></scope> .</sentence>
