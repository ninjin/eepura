<sentence id="0">Proteasome nuclear activity affects chromosome stability by controlling the turnover of Mms22 , a protein important for DNA repair .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To expand the known spectrum of genes that maintain genome stability , we screened a recently released collection of temperature sensitive ( Ts ) yeast mutants for a chromosome instability ( CIN ) phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Proteasome subunit genes represented a major functional group , and subsequent analysis demonstrated an evolutionarily conserved role in CIN .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis of individual proteasome core and lid subunit mutations showed that the CIN phenotype at semi-permissive temperature is associated with failure of subunit localization to the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The resultant proteasome dysfunction affects chromosome stability by impairing the kinetics of double strand break ( DSB ) repair .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that the DNA repair protein Mms22 is required for DSB repair , and recruited to chromatin in a ubiquitin-dependent manner as a result of DNA damage .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of Mms22 is necessary and sufficient for cell cycle progression through the G(2)/M arrest induced by DNA damage .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our results demonstrate for the first time that a double strand break repair protein is a proteasome target , and thus link nuclear proteasomal activity and DSB repair .</sentence>
