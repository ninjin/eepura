<sentence id="0">Genome-wide histone methylation profile for heart <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">failure</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epigenetic alterations are implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure , but little is known of which epigenetic changes in which regions of the genome play such a role .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now show that trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine-4 ( K4TM ) or lysine-9 ( K9TM ) is markedly affected in cardiomyocytes in association with the development of heart failure in a rat disease model .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">High-throughput pyrosequencing performed with ChIP products for K4TM or K9TM prepared from human left ventricular tissue with retained or damaged function also revealed that protein-coding genes located in the vicinity of K4TM marks differ between functional and disabled myocytes , yet both sets of genes encode proteins that function in the same signal transduction pathways for cardiac function , indicative of differential K4TM marking during the development of heart failure .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , K9TM mark-profile was less dependent on the disease status compared to that of K4TM .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our data collectively reveal global epigenetic changes in cardiac myocytes associated with heart failure .</sentence>
