<sentence id="0">Acetylation of androgen receptor enhances coactivator binding and promotes prostate cancer cell growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Modification by acetylation occurs at epsilon-amino lysine residues of histones and transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Unlike phosphorylation , <scope type="neg" id="0">a direct link between transcription factor acetylation and cellular growth or apoptosis has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been established</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that the nuclear androgen receptor ( AR ) , a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator , is acetylated in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The acetylation of the AR is induced by ligand dihydrotestosterone and by histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors in living cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Direct AR acetylation augmented p300 binding in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Constructs mimicking neutral polar substitution acetylation ( AR(K630Q) , AR(K630T) ) enhanced p300 binding and reduced N-CoR/HDAC/Smad3 corepressor binding , whereas charged residue substitution ( AR(K630R) ) reduced p300 binding and enhanced corepressor binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The AR acetylation mimics promoted cell survival and growth of prostate cancer cells in soft agar and in nude mice and augmented transcription of a subset of growth control target gene promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , transcription factor acetylation regulates coactivator/corepressor complex binding , altering expression of specific growth control genes to promote aberrant cellular growth in vivo .</sentence>
