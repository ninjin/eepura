<sentence id="0">Histone H3 modifications associated with differentiation and long-term culture of mesenchymal adipose stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Long-term culture of mesenchymal stem cells leads to a loss of differentiation capacity , the molecular mechanism of which remains not understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show here that expansion of adipose stem cells ( ASCs ) to late passage ( replicative senescence ) is associated with promoter-specific and global changes in epigenetic histone modifications .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In undifferentiated ASCs , inactive adipogenic and myogenic promoters are enriched in a repressive combination of trimethylated H3K4 ( H3K4m3 ) and H3K27m3 in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of H3K9m3 , a heterochromatin mark</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assays <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> H3K4m3 and H3K27m3 co-occupy a fraction of nucleosomes on some but not all lineage-specific promoters examined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However in cultured primary keratinocytes , adipogenic and myogenic promoters are enriched in trimethylated H3K4 , K27 , and K9 , illustrating two distinct epigenetic states of inactive promoters related to potential for activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">H3K4m3 and H3K27m3 stably mark promoters during long-term ASC culture <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> loss of differentiation capacity is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> due to alterations in these histone modifications on these loci</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Adipogenic differentiation in early passage results in H3K27 demethylation and H3K9 acetylation specifically on adipogenic promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">On induction of differentiation in late passage , however , transcriptional upregulation is impaired , H3K27 trimethylation is maintained and H3K9 acetylation is inhibited on promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , the polycomb proteins Ezh2 and Bmi1 are targeted to promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This correlates with global cellular Ezh2 increase and H3K9 deacetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Promoter targeting by Ezh2 and Bmi1 in late passage ASCs <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> the establishment of a polycomb-mediated epigenetic program aiming at repressing transcription</scope> .</sentence>
