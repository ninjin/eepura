<sentence id="1">Neurotrophin receptors of the Trk family promote neuronal survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The signal transduction of Trk receptors is regulated by endosomal trafficking .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Monoubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases is an established signal for sorting of internalized receptors to late endosomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The NGF receptor TrkA is sorted to late endosomes and undergoes ubiquitination , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> a so far undefined regulatory role of proteasomal activity in the trafficking of TrkA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Surprisingly , we found that proteasomal inhibition alters the trafficking of TrkA from the late endosomal sorting pathway to the recycling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with impaired proteasomal activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , our study <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that missorting of neurotrophic receptors <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">might</cue> contribute to neuronal death in those neurodegenerative diseases that are known to be associated with impaired proteasomal function</scope></scope> .</sentence>
