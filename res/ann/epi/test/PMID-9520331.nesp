<sentence id="0">BMP1-related metalloproteinases promote the development of ventral mesoderm in early Xenopus embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Bone morphogenetic protein 1 ( BMP1 ) is a metalloproteinase closely related to Drosophila Tolloid ( Tld ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tld regulates dorsoventral patterning in early Drosophila embryos by enhancing the activity of Dpp , a member of the TGF-beta family most closely related to BMP2 and BMP4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In Xenopus <scope type="spec" id="0"> BMP4 <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to play an essential role in dorsoventral patterning , promoting the development of ventral fates during gastrula stages</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">if</cue> BMP1 has a role in regulating the activity of BMP4</scope> , we have isolated cDNAs for Xenopus BMP1 and a novel closely related gene that we have called xolloid ( xld ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Whereas xbmp1 is uniformly expressed at all stages tested , the initial uniform expression of xld becomes localized to two posterior ectodermal patches flanking the neural plate and later to the inner ectoderm of the developing tailbud .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">xld is also expressed in dorsal regions of the brain during tailbud stages and is especially abundant in the ventricular layer of the dorsal hindbrain caudal to the otic vesicle .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Overexpression of either gene inhibits the development of dorsoanterior structures in whole embryos and ventralizes activin-induced dorsal mesoderm in animal caps .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Since ventralization of activin-induced animal caps <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">can</cue> be blocked by coinjecting a dominant-inhibitory receptor for BMP2 and BMP4</scope> , we <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a role for BMP1 and Xld in regulating the ventralizing activity of these molecules</scope> .</sentence>
