Geldanamycin inhibits trichostatin A-induced cell death and histone H4 hyperacetylation in COS-7 cells. 
As widely believed treating cells with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, results in histone H4 hyperacetylation and cell cycle arrest. This compound is often compared with other potential anticancer drugs in cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation research. Furthermore, geldanamycin (GA), a 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) specific inhibitor, is a well-known potential anticancer agent. This study examines whether GA can affect the cellular functions induced by TSA. When using TSA treatment, although caused COS-7 cell death, pretreatment of 0.5 microg/ml GA for 30 min and an addition of 50 ng/ml TSA (GA + TSA) apparently averted cell death. Our results indicated that the cell survival rate was only approximately 20% when prolonged treatment was undertaken with 50 ng/ml TSA (TSA) alone for 24 h. In contrast, the cell survival rate was enhanced by two folds when treating with GA + TSA. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation assay revealed that fragmented DNA was produced 8 h after prolonged treatment with TSA alone. Within 16 h, the apoptotic percentages of TSA-treated cells were between 15-25%. In contrast, the other treatments did not exceed 6%. Furthermore, GA inhibited TSA-induced histone H4 hyperacetylation. Western blotting analysis further demonstrated that the HSP70 levels did not significantly increase in TSA-treated cells. However, the accumulated 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) markedly increased up to 2 to 3 folds at 8 h in GA- and GA + TSA-treated cells, and the maximum amount up to 5 to 7 folds at 20 h. Conversely, HSP90 did not markedly increase in all treatments. Based on the results in this study, we suggest that apoptosis induced by TSA can be prevented by GA-induced increment of heat shock proteins, particularly HSP70.
