<sentence id="0">Monoubiquitinated H2B is associated with the transcribed region of highly expressed genes in human cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone modifications have emerged as important regulators of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Histone H2B monoubiquitination has also been implicated in transcription ; however , better understanding of the biological significance of this modification in mammalian cells has been hindered by the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of suitable reagents</scope> , particularly antibodies capable of specifically recognizing ubiquitinated H2B ( ubH2B ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report the generation of anti-ubH2B monoclonal antibodies using a branched peptide as immunogen .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These antibodies provide a powerful tool for exploring the biochemical functions of H2B monoubiquitination at both a genome-wide and gene-specific level .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Application of these antibodies in high resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip experiments in human cells , using tiling arrays , revealed preferential association of ubiquitinated H2B with the transcribed regions of highly expressed genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Unlike dimethylated H3K4 , <scope type="neg" id="1">ubH2B was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> associated with distal promoter regions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , experimental modulation of the transcriptional activity of the tumour suppressor p53 was accompanied by rapid changes in the H2B ubiquitination status of its p21 target gene , attesting to the dynamic nature of this process .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It has recently been demonstrated that the apparent extent of gene expression often reflects elongation <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">rather than</cue> initiation rates</scope> ; thus , our findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that H2B ubiquitination is intimately linked with global transcriptional elongation in mammalian cells</scope> .</sentence>
