<sentence id="0">H2B ubiquitylation plays a role in nucleosome dynamics during transcription elongation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The monoubiquitylation of histone H2B has been associated with transcription initiation and elongation , but its role in these processes is poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report that H2B ubiquitylation is required for efficient reassembly of nucleosomes during RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) -mediated transcription elongation in yeast .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This role is carried out in cooperation with the histone chaperone Spt16 , and in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of H2B ubiquitylation and functional Spt16 , <scope type="neg" id="1">chromatin structure is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> properly restored in the wake of elongating Pol II</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Moreover , H2B ubiquitylation and Spt16 play a role in each other 's regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">H2B ubiquitylation is required for the stable accumulation of Spt16 at the GAL1 coding region , and Spt16 regulates the formation of ubiquitylated H2B both globally and at the GAL1 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data provide a mechanism linking H2B ubiquitylation to Spt16 in the regulation of nucleosome dynamics during transcription elongation .</sentence>
