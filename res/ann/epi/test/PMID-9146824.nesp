<sentence id="0">Plasma sialyltransferase levels in psychiatric disorders as a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> indicator of HPA axis function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A dysfunction in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> attributed to a change in glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) functionality</scope> , has been implicated in depression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have measured both lymphocyte GR receptor binding parameters and plasma sialyltransferase activity , as a biochemical marker of GR function , in two groups of patients suffering from depression or schizophrenia and in a group of age- and sex-matched controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While there was a significant increase in plasma cortisol levels in the depressed group , there were <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> changes in the lymphocyte GR binding parameters ( K(m) and Bmax )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">There was , however , a significant decrease in the plasma sialyltransferase : cortisol ratio in the depressed group <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> an inability of the raised cortisol levels to induce enzyme expression and this ratio</scope> <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">may</cue> provide a useful biochemical marker of cortisol receptor function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although there was an increase in the plasma activity of the alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase isozyme in the schizophrenic group , <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">no</cue> other changes were determined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , while the total plasma sialyltransferase:cortisol ratio reflects HPA axis function , <scope type="spec" id="6"> alterations in specific isozyme activity <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> also be associated with other CNS disease states</scope> .</sentence>
