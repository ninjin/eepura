<sentence id="0">Nuclear entry of the Drosophila melanogaster nuclear lamina protein YA correlates with developmentally regulated changes in its phosphorylation state .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Drosophila melanogaster YA protein is a maternally provided nuclear lamina component that is essential during the transition from meiosis to mitosis at the beginning of embryogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Localization of YA to the nuclear envelope is required for its function ; this localization is cell cycle-dependent during embryogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that the ability of YA to enter nuclei is modulated during development .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In developing egg chambers , YA protein is made but excluded from nuclei of nurse cells and oocytes ; upon egg activation , YA acquires the ability to enter nuclei and becomes incorporated into the nuclear lamina in unfertilized eggs and embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This localization switch correlates with changes in the phosphorylation state of YA .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">YA in ovaries is hyperphosphorylated relative to YA in unfertilized eggs and embryos .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Through site-directed mutagenesis , we identified 443T , a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> phosphorylation site for both cyclin-dependent protein kinase and mitogen-activated-protein kinase</scope> , as one of the sites <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> involved in this developmental control</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that phosphorylation plays a role in modulating the localization of YA during development</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">A model for developmental regulation of the nuclear entry of YA is <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">proposed</cue> and implications for understanding Drosophila egg activation are discussed</scope> .</sentence>
