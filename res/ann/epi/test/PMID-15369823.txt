Regioselectivity of taxoid-O-acetyltransferases: heterologous expression and characterization of a new taxadien-5alpha-ol-O-acetyltransferase. 
In addition to the anticancer drug Taxol, yew (Taxus) species produce a large variety of other taxane diterpenoids which differ mainly in the type of acyl and aroyl groups appended to the many hydroxyl functions on the taxane core; acetate esters are particularly common. Taxol bears an acetate at C10 and another at C4 thought to originate by intramolecular migration of a C5 acetate function in the process of oxetane ring formation, but many other naturally occurring taxoids bear acetate groups at C1, C2, C7, C9, and C13, in addition to C5 and C10. cDNAs encoding a taxoid 5alpha-O-acetyltransferase (taxadien-5alpha-ol as substrate) and a taxoid 10beta-O-acetyltransferase (10-deacetylbaccatin III as substrate) have been acquired from a recently isolated family of Taxus acyl/aroyltransferase clones. To explore the origins of other acetylated taxoids, the group of recombinant Taxus acyltransferases was investigated with a range of polyhydroxylated taxoids as substrates. From this survey, a new acetyltransferase clone (denoted TAX19) was identified that was capable of acetylating taxadien-5alpha-ol with activity comparable to that of the previously identified 5alpha-O-acetyltransferase (clone TAX1). However, when these two recombinant enzymes were presented with taxadien-triol and tetraol substrates, they exhibited different regiospecificities. The TAX1 enzyme preferentially acetylates the "northern" hemisphere hydroxyls at C9 and C10, whereas the TAX19 enzyme preferentially acetylates the "east-west" pole positions at C5 and C13. The TAX1 enzyme possesses the lowest KM value with taxadien-5alpha-ol (an early pathway metabolite) as substrate, with much higher KM values for the polyhydroxylated taxoid substrates, whereas the TAX19 enzyme possesses lower KM values (than the TAX1 transferase) for all taxoid substrates tested. These results suggest that both TAX1 and TAX19 acyltransferases may function at the early C5 acetylation step of taxoid metabolism, and that the TAX19 acyltransferase, because of its broader specificity for polyhydroxylated taxoids, may also function later in metabolism and be responsible for the production of many other acetylated taxoids.
