<sentence id="0">Direct acetylation of the estrogen receptor alpha hinge region by p300 regulates transactivation and hormone sensitivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulation of nuclear receptor gene expression involves dynamic and coordinated interactions with histone acetyl transferase ( HAT ) and deacetylase complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The estrogen receptor ( ERalpha ) contains two transactivation domains regulating ligand-independent and -dependent gene transcription ( AF-1 and AF-2 ( activation functions 1 and 2 ) ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">ERalpha-regulated gene expression involves interactions with cointegrators ( e.g. p300/CBP , P/CAF ) that have the capacity to modify core histone acetyl groups .</sentence>
