<sentence id="0">Suppression of microtubule dynamic instability and turnover in MCF7 breast cancer cells by sulforaphane .</sentence>
<sentence id="1"><scope type="spec" id="0"> Sulforaphane ( SFN ) , a prominent isothiocyanate present in cruciferous vegetables , is <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be responsible along with other isothiocyanates for the cancer preventive activity of such vegetables</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">SFN arrests mitosis , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> by affecting spindle microtubule function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A critical property of microtubules is their rapid and time-sensitive growth and shortening dynamics ( dynamic instability ) , and suppression of dynamics by antimitotic anticancer drugs ( e.g. taxanes and the vinca alkaloids ) is central to the anticancer mechanisms of such drugs .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that at concentrations that inhibited proliferation and mitosis of MCF7-green fluorescent protein-alpha-tubulin breast tumor cells by approximately 50 % ( ~ 15 microM ) , SFN significantly modified microtubule organization in arrested spindles without modulating the spindle microtubule mass , in a manner similar to that of much more powerful antimitotic drugs .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By using quantitative fluorescence video microscopy , we determined that at its mitotic concentration required to inhibit mitosis by 50 % , SFN suppressed the dynamic instability of the interphase microtubules in these cells , strongly reducing the rate and extent of growth and shortening and decreasing microtubule turnover , without affecting the polymer mass .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">SFN suppressed the dynamics of purified microtubules in a similar fashion at concentrations well below those required to depolymerize microtubules , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> the suppression of dynamic instability by SFN in cells is due to a direct effect on the microtubules</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> SFN arrests proliferation and mitosis by stabilizing microtubules in a manner weaker than but similar to more powerful clinically used antimitotic anticancer drugs and strongly support the <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">hypothesis</cue> that inhibition of mitosis by microtubule stabilization is important for SFN 's chemopreventive activity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
