<sentence id="0">Collagen cross-links in mineralizing tissues : a review of their chemistry , function , and clinical relevance .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Bone collagen cross-links are now widely used to assess bone resorption levels in many metabolic bone diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The post-translational modifications of bone and other mineralizing collagens are significantly different from those of other type I collagen matrices , a fact that has been exploited during recent advances in the development of biochemical markers of bone resorption .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The enzymatic collagen cross-linking mechanism is based upon aldehyde formation from specific telopeptide lysine or hydroxylysine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The immature ketoimine cross-links in bone form via the condensation of a telopeptide aldehyde with a helical lysine or hydroxylysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Subsequent maturation to the pyridinoline and pyrrole cross-links occur by further reaction of the ketoimines with telopeptide aldehydes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In mineralizing tissues , a relatively low level of lysyl hydroxylation results in low levels of hydroxylysyl pyridinoline , and the occurrence of the largely bone specific lysyl pyridinoline and pyrrolic cross-links .</sentence>

<sentence id="8">The matrix of the turkey tendon only mineralizes after a remodeling of the collagen and the subsequent formation of a modified matrix more typical of bone than tendon .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Further , disturbances in the post-translational modification of collagen can also affect the mineralization density and crystal structure of the tissue .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In addition to their use as a convenient measure of matrix degradation , collagen cross-links are of significant importance for the biomechanical integrity of bone .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Recent studies of osteoporotic bone , for example , have demonstrated that subtle perturbations in the pattern of lysine hydroxylation result in changes in the cross-link profile .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These alterations , specifically changes in the level of the pyrrolic cross-link , also correlate with the strength of the bone .</sentence>
