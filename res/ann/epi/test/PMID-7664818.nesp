<sentence id="0">In vivo activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in rat adrenal glands following administration of quinpirole and dopamine .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using adrenal dopamine as indicator we have previously obtained evidence that quinpirole and several other agonists on dopamine D2-like receptors acutely stimulate the synthesis of adrenal catecholamines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study we measured the effect of quinpirole and dopamine on the hydroxylation of tyrosine in the adrenals , using the method of DOPA ( 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ) accumulation following the administration of the inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase NSD 1015 ( 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazyne ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In view of the large amounts of catecholamines in the adrenal tissue samples , this necessitated a modification of the method for analysing DOPA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Both quinpirole and dopamine significantly enhanced the rate of DOPA accumulation in the adrenals , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> stimulation of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The effect of dopamine was blocked by domperidone , a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that penetrates poorly into the central nervous system .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus the effect of dopamine , which itself penetrates poorly into the central nervous system , was <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">presumably</cue> mediated peripherally</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similarly epinine , i.e. the N-methyl derivative of dopamine , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">appeared</cue> to enhance adrenal catecholamine synthesis , as indicated by an elevated adrenal dopamine level</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The data support the view that stimulation of peripherally located dopamine D2-like receptors can enhance the rate of adrenal catecholamine synthesis by stimulating the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase .</sentence>
