Reduced S-adenosylmethionine:protein-lysine N-methyltransferase activity (protein methylase III) in shiverer mutant mouse brain. 
Mice with the dysmyelinating mutation shiverer were studied by measuring the activity of two protein methylases and myelin marker enzymes in the brain. It was observed that S-adenosylmethionine:protein-lysine N-methyltransferase (protein methylase III, EC. 2.1.1.43) activity is significantly reduced in phenotypically affected homozygous shiverer (shi/shi) mutant mouse brain compared to the unaffected heterozygous littermate brain. This reduction in enzyme activity is manifested mainly by reduced formation of trimethyllysine during the in vitro methylation of histone. In contrast, myelin marker enzymes such as 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase and 5'-nucleotidase as well as S-adenosyl-methionine:protein-carboxyl O-methyltransferase (protein methylase II, EC. 2.1.1.24) activities were not significantly affected in these strains of mice.
