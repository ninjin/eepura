<sentence id="0">SPARC/osteonectin is a frequent target for aberrant methylation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and a mediator of tumor-stromal interactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Deregulated expression of SPARC/osteonectin , a secreted glycoprotein with multiple biological functions , has been associated with the progression of various cancers .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using microarrays , we previously identified SPARC as one of the genes induced by treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor in pancreatic cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We therefore analysed the expression pattern and methylation status of the SPARC gene in pancreatic cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Gene expression profiling by oligonucleotide microarray and reverse transcription-PCR analyses demonstrated that SPARC mRNA was expressed in non-neoplastic pancreatic ductal epithelial cells , but was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> expressed in a majority of pancreatic cancer cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The loss of SPARC expression was associated with aberrant hypermethylation of its CpG island .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Immunohistochemical labeling revealed that the SPARC protein was overexpressed in the stromal fibroblasts immediately adjacent to the neoplastic epithelium in primary pancreatic cancers , but rarely expressed in the cancers themselves .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Primary fibroblasts derived from pancreatic cancer strongly expressed SPARC mRNA and secreted SPARC protein into the conditioned media , and treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with exogenous SPARC resulted in growth suppression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">SPARC expression in fibroblasts from noncancerous pancreatic tissue was augmented by coculture with pancreatic cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that SPARC is a frequent target for aberrant methylation in pancreatic cancer and that SPARC expression in fibroblasts adjacent to pancreatic cancer cells is regulated through tumor-stromal interactions</scope> .</sentence>
