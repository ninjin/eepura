<sentence id="0">Arginine methylation of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein results in its diminished function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : The HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein ( NC ) is involved in transfer RNA3 annealing to the primer binding site of viral genomic RNA by means of two basic regions that are similar to the N-terminal portion of the arginine-rich motif ( ARM ) of Tat .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">As Tat is known to be asymmetrically arginine dimethylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 6 ( PRMT6 ) in its ARM , we investigated <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> NC <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> also act as a substrate for this enzyme</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : Arginine methylation of NC was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo , and sites of methylation were determined by mutational analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The impact of the arginine methylation of NC was measured in RNA annealing and reverse transcription initiation assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">An arginine methyltransferase inhibitor (AMI)3.4 was tested for its effects on viral infectivity and replication in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : NC is a substrate for PRMT6 both in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">NC possesses arginine dimethylation sites in each of its two basic regions at positions R10 and R32 , and methylated NC was less able than wild-type to promote RNA annealing and participate in the initiation of reverse transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Exposure of HIV-1-infected MT2 and primary cord blood mononuclear cells to AMI3.4 led to increased viral replication , whereas viral infectivity was not significantly affected in multinuclear-activation galactosidase indicator assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSION : NC is an in-vivo target of PRMT6 , and arginine methylation of NC reduces RNA annealing and the initiation of reverse transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> lead to ways of driving HIV-infected cells out of latency with drugs that inhibit PRMT6</scope> .</sentence>
