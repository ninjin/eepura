<sentence id="0">Expression and characterization of the human erythrocyte anion exchanger in a baculovirus/Sf-9 cell system .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human erythrocyte anion-exchange protein ( HAE1 ) has been expressed in insect Sf-9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We subcloned the full-length cDNA encoding HAE1 into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 and cotransfected Sf-9 cells with the recombinant vector and wild-type AcMNPV DNA to obtain recombinant baculovirus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The expressed protein was targeted to the Sf-9 plasma membrane at an apparent density of approximately 0.5 x 10(6) copies/cell as determined by quantitative autoradiography using an HAE1-specific monoclonal antibody .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Unlike native HAE1 , <scope type="neg" id="0">the expressed protein was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> glycosylated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transport studies with HAE1-recombinant-infected Sf-9 cells showed saturable [ Km(Cl-) = 44 mM ; Vmax(Cl-) = 48 mEq/liter of cell waters min ] and H2DIDS-inhibitable ( K(O.5) = 34 microM ) 36Cl- uptake that was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> present in uninfected cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also found that extracellular SO4(2-) reduced 36Cl- influx [ K(0.5)((SO4)2-) = 26 mM ] , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">presumably</cue> through substrate competition as in erythrocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , we observed that H2DIDS-inhibitable 36Cl- efflux was reduced by 77 % in the nominal <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of a suitable counter-anion in the external solution ( HCO3(-)-free , all-glucuronate medium )</scope> , thereby providing strong evidence for an obligatory exchange mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We conclude that there is high-level expression of + ++HAE1 functional activity in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells and that this system will prove useful for kinetic and structural analyses of the HAE1 protein .</sentence>
