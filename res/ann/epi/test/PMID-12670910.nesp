<sentence id="0">Methylation of p16(INK4a) promoters occurs in vivo in histologically normal human mammary epithelia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cultures of human mammary epithelial cells ( HMECs ) contain a subpopulation of variant cells with the capacity to propagate beyond an in vitro proliferation barrier .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These variant HMECs , which contain hypermethylated and silenced p16(INK4a) ( p16 ) promoters , eventually accumulate multiple chromosomal changes , many of which are similar to those detected in premalignant and malignant lesions of breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To determine the origin of these variant HMECs in culture , we used Luria-Delbruck fluctuation analysis and found that variant HMECs exist within the population before the proliferation barrier , thereby <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">raising the</cue> possibility that variant HMECs exist in vivo before cultivation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To test this hypothesis , we examined mammary tissue from normal women for evidence of p16 promoter hypermethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we show that epithelial cells with methylation of p16 promoter sequences occur in focal patches of histologically normal mammary tissue of a substantial fraction of healthy , cancer-free women .</sentence>
