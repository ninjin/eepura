The other Topa: formation of 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine in peptides. 
Hydroxylation of peptidyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (Dopa) was observed during tyrosinase incubation of a decapeptide related to the mussel adhesive protein mefp1. The reaction was carried out at high enzyme concentrations (700 units tyrosinase/micromol of tyrosine). The hydroxylation of tyrosines in the decapeptide proceeds sequentially. First, Tyr-9 is hydroxylated to Dopa, followed by hydroxylation of Tyr-5; finally, Dopa-9 is hydroxylated to Topa. Topa was identified as 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (3,4,5-Topa) by comparison to known standards using amino acid analysis, derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate in combination with Edman sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry with time-of-flight. Two other peptides, not related to mussel proteins, were also found to form peptidyl-Topa upon incubation with tyrosinase. Although 3,4,5-Topa has been reported in the primary sequence of several peptides, its formation in vitro from tyrosine-containing peptides is novel. The formation of Topa would appear to be a function of tyrosinase rather than the nucleophilic addition of water to dopaquinone.
