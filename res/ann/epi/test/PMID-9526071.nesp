<sentence id="1">Clusterin is a N-glycosylated sialoglycoprotein present in rat brain cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Clusterin , which elicits aggregation in a wide variety of cells , has been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> to play an important role in synaptic remodeling through its cell adhesion property or lipid transport capacity in the brain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Sialic acid residues in clusterin <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be responsible for its structural conformation , stability and functional ability</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="8">Therefore , in this investigation , we have studied the specific effects of chronic ethanol treatment on the glycosylation of rat brain clusterin and the causes that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> lead to any <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">possible</cue> defects in the glycosylation process</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We have determined the effects of chronic ethanol treatment on ( i ) the incorporation of labeled leucine and N-acetylmannosamine into immunoprecipitable clusterin in whole brain homogenate , microsomes , golgi , cytosol , plasma membrane and synaptosomes , ( ii ) enzymatic activities of sialyltransferases in golgi and synaptosomes , and sialidase in brain cytosol and plasma membranes , and ( iii ) de novo synthetic rate of rat brain cytosolic sialidase .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our results showed that chronic ethanol treatment in rats resulted in ( 1 ) a decreased sialation index of brain clusterin by 47.2 % ( p<0.001 ) , 56.7 % ( p<0.05 ) , 51.7 % ( p<0.05 ) , 64.8 % ( p<0.001 ) , and 54.5 % ( p<0.05 ) , respectively , in whole brain homogenate , golgi , cytosol , plasma membranes , and synaptosomes ; ( 2 ) a 46.1 % ( p<0.05 ) and 12.5 % ( p<0.05 ) decreased activities of brain sialyltransferases , respectively , in the golgi and the synaptosomal fractions ; ( 3 ) a 70.1 % ( p<0.05 ) and 42.6 % ( p<0.05 ) increased activities of sialidases , respectively , in the cytosol and plasma membrane fractions ; and ( 4 ) a 22.2%-64.3 % ( p<0.001 ) increased incorporation of labeled leucine into brain cytosolic sialidase .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Our findings have clearly established that long-term ethanol treatment in rats leads to a marked impairment in the glycosylation of rat brain clusterin as a result of altered activities of brain sialation and desialation enzymes .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In particular , the specific increase noted in brain sialidase activity was due to concomitant increases in its synthetic rate .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">These defects in the glycosylation of brain clusterin <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> lead to changes in the molecular conformation of clusterin</scope> , and thus , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> result in its structural instability and/or functional impairment</scope> .</sentence>
