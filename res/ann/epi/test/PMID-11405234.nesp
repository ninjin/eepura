<sentence id="0">Epigenetics of latent Epstein-Barr virus genomes : high resolution methylation analysis of the bidirectional promoter region of latent membrane protein 1 and 2B genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We analysed the methylation patterns of CpG dinucleotides in a bidirectional promoter region ( LRS , LMP 1 regulatory sequences ) of latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) genomes using automated fluorescent genomic sequencing after bisulfite-induced modification of DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Transcripts for two latent membrane proteins , LMP 1 ( a transforming protein ) and LMP 2B , are initiated in this region in opposite directions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that B cell lines and a clone expressing LMP 1 carried EBV genomes with unmethylated or hypomethylated LRS , while highly methylated CpG dinucleotides were present at each position <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> at discrete sites and within hypermethylated regions in LMP 1 negative cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Comparison of high resolution methylation maps <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that CpG methylation-mediated direct interference with binding of nuclear factors LBF 2 , 3 , 7 , AML1/LBF1 , LBF5 and LBF6 or methylation of CpGs within an E-box sequence ( where activators as well as repressors can bind ) is not the major mechanism in silencing of the LMP 1 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although a role for CpG methylation within binding sites of Sp1 and 3 , ATF/CRE and a sis-inducible factor ( SIF ) cannot be excluded , hypermethylation of LRS or regions within LRS in LMP 1 negative cells <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> a role for an indirect mechanism , via methylcytosine binding proteins , in silencing of the LMP 1 promoter</scope> .</sentence>
