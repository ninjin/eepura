<sentence id="0">Identification of a 374 amino acid protein encoded by RNA segment 6 of influenza C virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Unspliced mRNA from RNA segment 6 of influenza C virus contains a single open reading frame that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> encodes a polypeptide of 374 amino acids</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2"><scope type="spec" id="2"> This polypeptide , <scope type="neg" id="1">which has <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> been identified as yet</scope> , is <cue type="spec" id="2">predicted</cue> to contain the complete amino acid sequence of the matrix protein , M1 , as well as that of a small integral membrane protein , CM2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we found that small amounts of two previously unrecognized proteins with apparent molecular masses of 42 ( P42 ) and 44 kDa ( P44 ) were immunoprecipitated with immune serum against CM2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The electrophoretic mobilities of P42 and P44 varied depending on virus strain , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating that</cue> they are virus-coded</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment of infected cells with tunicamycin and digestion of immunoprecipitated proteins with various endoglycosidases revealed that P42 is modified by the addition of a high-mannose oligosaccharide chain to generate P44 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A monoclonal antibody against M1 , like anti-CM2 serum , was able to immunoprecipitate both the P42 and P44 proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , the tryptic peptide map of either P42 or P44 was indistinguishable from the map of the mixture of M1 and CM2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results , taken together , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> strongly that P42 and P44 correspond to the 374 amino acid protein encoded by unspliced RNA segment 6 mRNA and its N-glycosylated form , respectively</scope> .</sentence>
