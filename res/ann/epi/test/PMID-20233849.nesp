<sentence id="0">N4BP1 is a newly identified nucleolar protein that undergoes SUMO-regulated polyubiquitylation and proteasomal turnover at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A number of proteins can be conjugated with both ubiquitin and the small ubiquitin-related modifier ( SUMO ) , with crosstalk between these two post-translational modifications serving to regulate protein function and stability .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We previously identified N4BP1 as a substrate for monoubiquitylation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we describe Nedd4-mediated polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of N4BP1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , we show that N4BP1 can be conjugated with SUMO1 and that this abrogates N4BP1 ubiquitylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistent with this , endogenous N4BP1 is stabilized in primary embryonic fibroblasts from mutants of the desumoylating enzyme SENP1 , which show increased steady-state sumoylation levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have localized endogenous N4BP1 predominantly to the nucleolus in primary cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , a small fraction is found at promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) nuclear bodies ( NBs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In cells deficient for SENP1 or in wild-type cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 , there is considerable accumulation of N4BP1 at PML NBs .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> a dynamic interaction between subnuclear compartments , and a role for post-translational modification by ubiquitin and SUMO in the regulation of nucleolar protein turnover</scope> .</sentence>
