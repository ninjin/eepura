<sentence id="0">Chimeric chemoreceptors in Escherichia coli : signaling properties of Tar-Tap and Tap-Tar hybrids .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The Tap ( taxis toward peptides ) receptor and the periplasmic dipeptide-binding protein ( DBP ) of Escherichia coli together mediate chemotactic responses to dipeptides .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Tap is a low-abundance receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It is present in 5- to 10-fold-fewer copies than high-abundance receptors like Tar and Tsr. Cells expressing Tap as the sole receptor , even from a multicopy plasmid at 5- to 10-fold-overexpressed levels , do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> generate sufficient clockwise ( CW ) signal to tumble and thus swim exclusively smoothly ( run )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To study the signaling properties of Tap in detail , we constructed reciprocal hybrids between Tap and Tar fused in the linker region between the periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The Tapr hybrid senses dipeptides and is a good CW-signal generator , whereas the Tarp hybrid senses aspartate but is a poor CW-signal generator .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , the poor CW signaling of Tap is a property of its cytoplasmic domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Eighteen residues at the carboxyl terminus of high-abundance receptors , including the NWETF sequence that binds the CheR methylesterase , are <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">missing</cue> in Tap</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The Tart protein , created by removing these 18 residues from Tar , has diminished CW-signaling ability .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The Tapl protein , made by adding the last 18 residues of Tar to the carboxyl terminus of Tap , also does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> support CW flagellar rotation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">However , Tart and Tapl cross-react well with antibody directed against the conserved cytoplasmic region of Tsr , whereas Tap does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> cross-react with this antibody</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Tap does cross-react , however , with antibody directed against the low-abundance chemoreceptor Trg. The hybrid , truncated , and extended receptors exhibit various levels of methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">However , Tar and Tapl , which contain a consensus CheR-binding motif ( NWETF ) at their carboxyl termini , exhibit the highest basal levels of methylation , as expected .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">We conclude that <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> simple correlation exists between the abundance of a receptor</scope> , its methylation level , and its CW-signaling ability .</sentence>
