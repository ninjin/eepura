<sentence id="0">Human papillomavirus oncoprotein E7 targets the promyelocytic leukemia protein and circumvents cellular senescence via the Rb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cellular senescence can be triggered by a variety of signals , including loss of telomeric integrity or intense oncogenic signaling , and is considered a potent , natural tumor suppressor mechanism .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previously , it was shown that the promyelocytic leukemia protein ( PML ) induces cellular senescence when overexpressed in primary human fibroblasts .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The mechanism by which the PML IV isoform elicits this irreversible growth arrest is <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">believed</cue> to involve activation of the tumor suppressor pathways p21/p53 and p16/Rb</scope> ; however , <scope type="neg" id="0">a requirement for either pathway has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been demonstrated unequivocally</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">To investigate the individual contributions of p53 and Rb to PML-induced senescence , we used oncoproteins E6 and E7 from human papillomaviruses ( HPVs ) , which predominantly target p53 and Rb. We show that E7 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> E6</scope> , circumvents PML-induced senescence .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using different E7 mutant proteins , dominant negative cyclin-dependent kinase 4 , and p16 RNA interference , we demonstrate that Rb-related and Rb-independent mechanisms of E7 are necessary for subversion of PML-induced senescence and we identify PML as a novel target for E7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interaction between E7 and a functional prosenescence complex composed of PML , p53 , and CBP perturbs transcriptional activation of p53 , thus highlighting a significant effect also on the p53 tumor suppressor pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Given the importance of HPV in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer , our results warrant a more detailed analyses of PML in HPV infections .</sentence>
