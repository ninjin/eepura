<sentence id="2">Here we show that a receptor with seven transmembrane domains , the calcitonin-receptor-like receptor ( CRLR ) , can function as either a CGRP receptor or an adrenomedullin receptor , depending on which members of a new family of single-transmembrane-domain proteins , which we have called receptor-activity-modifying proteins or RAMPs , are expressed .</sentence>
