<sentence id="0">Sorting of rat SPNT in renal epithelium is independent of N-glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PURPOSE : The sodium-dependent , purine-selective nucleoside transporter , SPNT , has a unique steady-state expression pattern in renal epithelial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In comparison with the concentrative nucleoside transporter , CNTI , which is confined to the apical membrane , SPNT is expressed predominantly on the apical membrane but with significant expression on the basolateral membrane as well .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Alternate surface expression <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates that</cue> SPNT <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> has different sorting and trafficking mechanisms from CNTI</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Because glycosylation has been reported to be essential for apical targeting of other transporters , and SPNT contains three unique glycosylation sites , we examined the importance of glycosylation in sorting of SPNT .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Preliminary studies <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> that glycosylation affects surface expression of SPNT but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> CNT1</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">METHODS : All three unique glycosylation sites were mutated alone and in tandem .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Wild-type and mutant SPNT , tagged with green fluorescence protein , were stably transfected into MDCK .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Positive clones were assayed for polarized surface expression by immunofluorescence and functional analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">RESULTS : Mutation at all three sites alone <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">or</cue> in tandem</scope> resulted in functional proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Removal of sites N606 and N625 resulted in proteins of reduced molecular mass .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">None of the unglycosylated mutants localized differently than wild-type SPNT .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">CONCLUSION : N-linked glycosylation is <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> essential for polarized sorting</scope> .</sentence>
