<sentence id="0">Ischemia-reperfusion-inducible protein modulates cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs by regulating activity of efflux transporter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human ischemia-reperfusion-inducible protein ( hIRIP ) or hYrdC belongs to the SUA5/YrdC/YciO protein family and affects activity of a variety of cellular transporters .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We observed that overexpression of wild-type or dominant-negative mutant of hIRIP protein affects the cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs with different mechanisms of toxicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we investigated in detail the effect of hIRIP on cell sensitivity to doxorubicin and show that hIRIP inhibits the drug efflux .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein was identified as one of the target transporters .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">IRIP does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> influence P-glycoprotein biosynthesis</scope> but affects its processing and promotes degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also show that P-glycoprotein is associated with COP-alpha , one of the proteins of the COPI complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This interaction is sensitive to the level of hIRIP expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that hIRIP expression can regulate cargo assembly and function of efflux transporters , including P-glycoprotein , which mediates one of the most common mechanisms of the multidrug resistance</scope> .</sentence>
