<sentence id="0">A model of partnership co-opted by the homeodomain protein TGIF and the Itch/AIP4 ubiquitin ligase for effective execution of TNF-alpha cytotoxicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The homeodomain protein TGIF functions as a negative regulator of multiple classes of transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we report on the characterization of TGIF as an essential component of the tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) cytotoxic program .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="1"> <scope type="neg" id="0">This proapoptotic role of TGIF does <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="1">appear</cue> to rely on transcriptional modulation</scope> but instead</scope> is executed in conjunction with Itch/AIP4 , an E3 ubiquitin ligase operating in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through its ability to target the caspase antagonist cFlip(L) for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Notably , we found that activation of TNF-alpha signaling induced the association of TGIF with Itch/AIP4 , resulting in increased accessibility of cFlip(L) for association and ubiquitination by Itch/AIP4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Moreover , we show that Itch/AIP4 can also stabilize the TGIF protein in response to TNF-alpha by triggering its monoubiquitination at lysine 259 , thereby revealing the existence of a functional network that can evolve into a positive feedback loop for ensuring effective execution of the TNF-alpha apoptotic signaling .</sentence>
