<sentence id="0">Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> seven-transmembrane-domain receptor</scope> is mediated by an arrestin-related protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mammalian arrestins have a major role in the intracellular trafficking of seven-transmembrane ( 7TM ) receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The fungal ambient pH signaling pathway involves an arrestin-related protein , PalF/Rim8 , and the ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) machinery .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We found that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Rim8 binds to both the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> 7TM pH sensor Rim21</scope> and the ESCRT-I subunit Vps23 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that an SXP motif in Rim8 mediates binding to the Vps23 ubiquitin E2 variant ( UEV ) domain and that a monoubiquitinated residue near the SXP motif contributes to this interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We present evidence that Rim8 ubiquitination is dependent on the Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin ligase and triggered upon binding of Vps23 UEV to both the SXP motif and ubiquitin , thus <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> a two-step binding mechanism</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We further show that Rim8 coimmunoprecipitates with ESCRT-I subunits Vps23 and Vps28 , supporting the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">idea</cue> that binding of Rim8 to Vps23 mediates the association of Rim8 with the ESCRT-I complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Fluorescence microscopic analyses <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> overexpressed Rim8 and Vps23 colocalize at cortical punctate structures , providing additional evidence of the interaction between these two proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Strikingly , our findings <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> evolutionary conserved mechanisms control the recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to Pal/Rim proteins in fungi and retroviral Gag proteins in animal cells</scope> .</sentence>
