<sentence id="0">Highly restricted localization of RNA polymerase II within a locus control region of a tissue-specific chromatin domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) can associate with regulatory elements far from promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">For the murine beta-globin locus , Pol II binds the beta-globin locus control region ( LCR ) far upstream of the beta-globin promoters , independent of recruitment to and activation of the betamajor promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We describe here an analysis of where Pol II resides within the LCR , how it is recruited to the LCR , and the functional consequences of recruitment .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">High-resolution analysis of the distribution of Pol II revealed that Pol II binding within the LCR is restricted to the hypersensitive sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Blocking elongation eliminated the synthesis of genic and extragenic transcripts and eliminated Pol II from the betamajor open reading frame .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , the elongation blockade did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> redistribute Pol II at the hypersensitive sites</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that Pol II is recruited to these sites</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The distribution of Pol II did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> strictly correlate with the distributions of histone acetylation and methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">As Pol II associates with histone-modifying enzymes , Pol II tracking <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">might</cue> be critical for establishing and maintaining broad histone modification patterns</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , blocking elongation did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> disrupt the histone modification pattern of the beta-globin locus</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating that</cue> <scope type="neg" id="5">Pol II tracking is <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> required to maintain the pattern</scope></scope> .</sentence>
