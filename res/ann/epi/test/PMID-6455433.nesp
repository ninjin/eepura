<sentence id="0">Studies of acetylation and deacetylation in high mobility group proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Identification of the sites of acetylation in high mobility group proteins 14 and 17 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Duck erythrocytes were incubated with [3H]acetate both in the presence and absence of sodium butyrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Subsequent perchloric acid extraction of the nuclei , followed by selective acetone precipitation , CM-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography , and gel filtration yielded radioactively labeled high mobility group ( HMG ) proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 in pure form .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Extensive enzymatic degradation of the proteins followed by amino acid analysis of the digests yielded a significant amount of material eluting in the position of epsilon-N-acetyllysine .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , automated Edman degradation of intact 3H-labeled HMG-14 and HMG-17 identified the specific sites of acetylation of these proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In both erythrocyte HMGs isolated from cells not exposed to butyrate , the lysine residue at position 2 was the only one found to be labeled .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , one additional site in HMG-14 and two additional sites in HMG-17 were found in the proteins from cells incubated in butyrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , studies of the enzymatic deacetylation of HMG-14 and HMG-17 confirmed that both nuclear proteins serve as deacetylase substrates and that butyrate inhibits their deacetylation , just as in the case of other HMG proteins and nucleosomal core histones .</sentence>
