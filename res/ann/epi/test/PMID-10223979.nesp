<sentence id="1">Phytase improves the bioavailability of phytate phosphorus in plant foods to humans and animals and reduces phosphorus pollution of animal waste .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Our objectives were to express an Aspergillus niger phytase gene ( phyA ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to determine the effects of glycosylation on the phytase 's activity and thermostability .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A 1.4-kb DNA fragment containing the coding region of the phyA gene was inserted into the expression vector pYES2 and was expressed in S. cerevisiae as an active , extracellular phytase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The yield of total extracellular phytase activity was affected by the signal peptide and the medium composition .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The expressed phytase had two pH optima ( 2 to 2.5 and 5 to 5.5 ) and a temperature optimum between 55 and 60 degrees C , and it cross-reacted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the wild-type enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Due to the heavy glycosylation , the expressed phytase had a molecular size of approximately 120 kDa and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to be more thermostable than the commercial enzyme</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Deglycosylation of the phytase resulted in losses of 9 % of its activity and 40 % of its thermostability .</sentence>
