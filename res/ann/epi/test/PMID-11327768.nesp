<sentence id="0">The X-ray crystal structure of the Trichoderma reesei family 12 endoglucanase 3 , Cel12A , at 1.9 A resolution .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We present the three-dimensional structure of Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase 3 ( Cel12A ) , a small , 218 amino acid residue ( 24.5 kDa ) , neutral pI , glycoside hydrolase family 12 cellulase that <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacks</cue> a cellulose-binding module</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The structure has been determined using X-ray crystallography and refined to 1.9 A resolution .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The asymmetric unit consists of six non-crystallographic symmetry-related molecules that were exploited to improve initial multiple isomorphous replacement phasing , and subsequent structure refinement .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The enzyme contains one disulfide bridge and is glycosylated at Asp164 by a single N-acetyl glucosamine residue .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The protein has the expected fold for a glycoside hydrolase clan-C family 12 enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It contains two beta-sheets , of six and nine strands , packed on top of one another , and one alpha-helix .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The concave surface of the nine-stranded beta-sheet forms a large substrate-binding groove in which the active-site residues are located .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In the active site , we find a carboxylic acid trio , similar to that of glycoside hydrolase families 7 and 16 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The strictly conserved Asp99 hydrogen bonds to the nucleophile , the invariant Glu116 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The binding crevice is lined with both aromatic and polar amino acid side-chains which <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play a role in substrate binding</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The structure of the fungal family 12 enzyme presented here allows a complete structural characterization of the glycoside hydrolase-C clan .</sentence>
