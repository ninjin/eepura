<sentence id="0">Structure-function relationship of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor ( CaR ) originally cloned from bovine parathyroid gland is a G protein-coupled receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The physiological relevance of the cloned CaR for sensing and regulating the extracellular calcium concentration has been established by identifying hyper- and hypocalcemic disorders resulting from inactivating and activating mutations , respectively , in the CaR .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The cloned CaR has been stably or transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and significant progress has been made in elucidating its regulation and activation process using physiological , biochemical and molecular biological methods .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A large collection of naturally occurring CaR mutations offers a valuable resource for studies aimed at understanding the structure-function relationships of the receptor , including functional importance of CaR dimerization .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In turn , characterization of these naturally occurring mutations has clarified the pathogenesis of clinical conditions involving abnormalities in the CaR , such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism .</sentence>
