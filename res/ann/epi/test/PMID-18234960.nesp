<sentence id="0">HOP/OB1/NECC1 promoter DNA is frequently hypermethylated and involved in tumorigenic ability in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Promoter DNA hypermethylation with gene silencing is a common feature of human cancer , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> cancer-prone methylation is <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> to be a landmark of tumor suppressor genes ( TSG )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Identification of novel methylated genes <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">would</cue> not only aid in the development of tumor markers but also elucidate the biological behavior of human cancers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We identified several epigenetically silenced candidate TSGs by pharmacologic unmasking of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) cell lines by demethylating agents ( 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine and trichostatin A ) combined with ESCC expression profiles using expression microarray .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HOP/OB1/NECC1 was identified as an epigenetically silenced candidate TSG and further examined for ( a ) expression status , ( b ) methylation status , and ( c ) functional involvement in cancer cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">( a ) The HOP gene encodes two <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">putative</cue> promoters ( promoters A and B ) associated with two open reading frames ( HOPalpha and HOPbeta , respectively</scope> ) , and HOPalpha and HOPbeta were both down-regulated in ESCC independently .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">( b ) Promoter B harbors dense CpG islands , in which we found dense methylation in a cancer-prone manner ( 55 % in tumor tissues by TaqMan methylation-specific PCR ) , whereas promoter A does <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> harbor CpG islands</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">HOPbeta silencing was associated with DNA methylation of promoter B in nine ESCC cell lines tested , and reactivated by optimal conditions of demethylating agents , whereas <scope type="neg" id="4">HOPalpha silencing was <cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> reactivated by such treatments</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Forced expression of HOP suppressed tumorigenesis in soft agar in four different squamous cell carcinoma cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">More convincingly , RNA interference knockdown of HOP in TE2 cells showed drastic restoration of the oncogenic phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In conclusion , HOP is a <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">putative</cue> TSG that harbors tumor inhibitory activity</scope> , and we for the first time showed that the final shutdown process of HOP expression is linked to promoter DNA hypermethylation under the double control of the discrete promoter regions in cancer .</sentence>
