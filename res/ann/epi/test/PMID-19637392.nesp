<sentence id="0">Purification and characterization of a transgenic corn grain-derived recombinant collagen type I alpha 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Corn offers advantages as a transgenic host for producing recombinant proteins required at large volumes ( 1,000 's of tons per year ) and low cost ( less than US$50/kg ) by generating them as co-products of biorefining .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We describe the purification and characterization of a corn grain-derived mammalian structural protein having such market characteristics : a full length recombinant collagen type I alpha 1 ( rCI alpha 1 ) chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Material properties of interest are gelation behavior , which <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">would</cue> depend on as yet unverified ability of corn to carry out post-translational prolyl hydroxylation and formation of triple helical conformation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The starting material was grain where the expression of rCI alpha 1 had been directed by an embryo-specific promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Purification consisted of extraction at low pH followed by membrane and chromatographic steps to isolate rCI alpha 1 for characterization .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The amino acid composition and immunoreactivity of CI alpha 1 was similar to that of an analogous native human CI alpha 1 and to rCI alpha 1 produced by the yeast Pichia pastoris .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the primary sequence of the corn-derived rCI alpha 1 with 46 % coverage .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Fragments of the rCI alpha 1 chains were also observed , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> caused by endogenous plant proteases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The corn-derived rCI alpha 1 had a low level of prolyl hydroxylation ( approximately 1 % versus 11 % ) relative to animal-derived CI alpha 1 and folded into its characteristic triple-helical structure as indicated by its resistance to pepsin digestion below its melting temperature of 26(o)C .</sentence>
<sentence id="10"><scope type="neg" id="2">The 29 amino acid foldon fused to the C-terminus to initiate triple helix formation was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> cleaved from the rCI alpha 1 chains</scope> , but could be removed by pepsin treatment .</sentence>
