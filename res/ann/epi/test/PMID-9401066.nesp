<sentence id="1">An adult woman diagnosed with cerebral thrombosis following a caesarean section was found to have severely prolonged thrombin and reptilase times .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Five other family members also had prolonged , but variable , thrombin and reptilase times .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis of purified fibrinogen on reducing SDS-PAGE revealed an additional band , in all family members , which migrated immediately below the normal B beta band .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Western blotting <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> this band was a gamma chain and endoglycosidase-F digestion established that it contained an additional oligosaccharide side chain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Partial acid hydrolysis localized the new oligosaccharide to the C-terminus of the gamma chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Amplification of this region by PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing demonstrated a single base substitution altering the normal 380 Lys ( AAG ) codon to Asn ( AAT ) , producing a new Asn-Lys-Thr glycosylation site .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The propositus and one other family member were homozygous for this mutation but the remaining four family members were heterozygous .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The polymerization of purified fibrin monomers from the propositus was grossly abnormal ; however , the polymerization curve was almost normalized by the removal of terminal sialic acid residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that the polymerization defect was primarily caused by additional negatively charged sialic acid residues present on the new oligosaccharide</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Further analysis of the D domain of purified fibrinogen established that calcium binding to the high affinity site remained unaffected by the bulky carbohydrate side chain or negatively charged sialic acid residues .</sentence>
