<sentence id="0">Identification of major lysine residues of S(3)-RNase of Petunia inflata involved in ubiquitin-26S proteasome-mediated degradation in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">S-RNase-based self-incompatibility has been identified in three flowering plant families , including the Solanaceae , and this self/non-self recognition mechanism between pollen and pistil is controlled by two polymorphic genes at the S-locus , S-RNase and S-locus F-box ( SLF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">S-RNase is produced in the pistil and taken up by pollen tubes in a non-S-haplotype-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">How an allelic product of SLF interacts with self and non-self S-RNases to result in growth inhibition of self pollen tubes is not completely understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One model predicts that SLF targets non-self S-RNases for ubiquitin/26S proteasome-mediated degradation , thereby only allowing self S-RNase to exert cytotoxic activity inside a pollen tube .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To test this model , we studied <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> any of the 20 lysine residues in S(3)-RNase of Petunia inflata <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> be targets for ubiquitination</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We identified six lysines near the C-terminus for which mutation to arginine significantly reduced ubiquitination and degradation of the mutant S(3)-RNase , GST:S(3)-RNase ( K141-164R ) in pollen tube extracts .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We further showed that GST:S(3)-RNase ( K141-164R ) and GST:S(3)-RNase had similar RNase activity , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that <scope type="neg" id="2">their degradation was <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">probably</cue> <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> caused by an ER-associated protein degradation pathway that removes mis-folded proteins</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , we showed that PiSBP1 ( P. inflata S-RNase binding protein 1 ) , a potential RING-HC subunit of the PiSLF ( P. inflata SLF ) -containing E3-like complex , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">could</cue> target S-RNase for ubiquitination in vitro</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">All these results <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggest</cue> that ubiquitin/26S proteasome-dependent degradation of S-RNase <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be an integral part of the S-RNase-based self-incompatibility mechanism</scope></scope> .</sentence>
