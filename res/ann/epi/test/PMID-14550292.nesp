<sentence id="0">Independent signals determine the subcellular localization of NEP in prostate cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NEP ( Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 ) is a cell surface enzyme that hydrolyzes bioactive neuropeptides implicated in the transition from androgen-dependent prostate cancer ( PC ) to androgen-independent PC .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We report the cloning and sequence analyses of NEP cDNAs from human androgen-responsive LNCaP PC cells and prostatic stromal cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To investigate the functional role of a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) detected within the N-terminus and of an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal within the C-terminus , NEP-GFP expression vectors were constructed containing the whole NEP gene , fragments encoding the N-terminus/C-terminus of the protein ( 5(')NEP-GFP/3(')NEP-GFP ) , and 5(')NEP-GFP constructs <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacking</cue> the NLS</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">3(')NEP-GFP transfected cells showed plasma membrane/cytoplasmic fluorescence whereas the 5(')NEP-GFP fusion protein was also detected in the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The omission of the NLS resulted in <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">no</cue> reduction in nuclear and an increase in cytoplasmic staining</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that the analyzed structural motifs determine the subcellular distribution of NEP in epithelial LNCaP PC cells and stromal prostatic cells and therefore could be responsible for the altered cellular localization of NEP observed in PC</scope> .</sentence>
