Concomitant hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen using purified enzymes in vitro. 
Concomitant hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in protocollagen was studied using purified enzymes. The data suggest that prolyl 4-hydroxylase (prolyl-glycyl-peptide, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.11.2) and lysyl hydroxylase (peptidyllysine, 2-oxoglutarate; oxygen 5-oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.11.4) are competing for the protocollagen substrate, this competition resulting in an inhibition of the lysyl hydroxylase but not of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase reaction. When the same protocollagen was used for these hydroxylases, the affinity of prolyl 4-hydroxylase to the protocollagen substrate was about 2-fold higher than that of lysyl hydroxylase. Hydroxylation of lysine residues in protocollagen had no effect on the affinity of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, whereas hydroxylation of proline residues decreased the affinity of lysyl hydroxylase to one-half of the value determined before the hydroxylation. When enzyme preparations containing different ratios of lysyl hydroxylase activity to prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity were used to hydroxylase protocollagen substrate, it was found that in the case of a low ratio the hydroxylation of lysine residues seemed to proceed only after a short lag period. Accordingly, it seems probable that most proline residues are hydroxylated to 4-hydroxyproline residues before hydroxylation of lysine residues if the prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase are present as free enzymes competing for the same protocollagen substrate.
