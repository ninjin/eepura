<sentence id="0">Proteasome inhibition induces neurite outgrowth through posttranslational modification of TrkA receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates many biological processes , including protein degradation , receptor endocytosis , protein sorting , subnuclear trafficking and neuronal differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While proteasome inhibition is known to induce neurite outgrowth , <scope type="neg" id="0">the signaling mechanisms that mediate these effects have <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been defined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we investigated the underlying mechanisms that link proteasome inhibition with neurite generation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that the proteasome inhibitors , MG132 and lactacystin , induced neurite outgrowth and also activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These proteasome inhibitors also induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of TrkA receptors , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> proteasome inhibition activates the major pathways of TrkA signaling</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">However , in contrast to nerve growth factor stimulation , which induces internalization of surface TrkA receptors , proteasome inhibitor-induced neurite outgrowth did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> require TrkA receptor internalization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> the ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates neurite formation through posttranslational modification of TrkA receptors</scope> .</sentence>
