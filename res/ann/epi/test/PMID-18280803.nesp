<sentence id="0">Regulation of ribosomal protein S6 kinases by ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6K ) is a key player in the regulation of cell growth and energy metabolism via the mTOR and PI3K signalling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The activity and subcellular localization of S6K are regulated by multiple S/T phosphorylations in response to diverse extracellular stimuli .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Downregulation of S6K signalling occurs through the action of S/T phosphatases ( PP2A and PP1 ) and tumor suppressors ( TSC1/2 and PTEN ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We report here that , in addition to phosphorylation , S6Ks are ubiquitinated in cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The pattern of ubiquitination and the effect of proteasomal inhibitors on the steady-state level of transiently overexpressed and endogenous S6Ks point to proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated S6Ks .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , we found that the site(s) of ubiquitination are located in the kinase domain and that the N- and C-terminal regulatory regions modulate the efficiency of S6K ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This study <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="1"> S6K signalling also <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> be regulated through the proteasome-mediated turnover of S6Ks</scope></scope> .</sentence>
