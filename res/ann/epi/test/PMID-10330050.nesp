<sentence id="0">Glycated albumin stimulation of PKC-beta activity is linked to increased collagen IV in mesangial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Albumin modified by Amadori-glucose adducts induces coordinate increases in the expression of extracellular matrix proteins , transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 , and the TGF-beta type II receptor in glomerular mesangial cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) accompanies the increased mesangial cell expression of matrix proteins and TGF-beta1 induced by high ambient glucose , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">postulated</cue> that glycated albumin ( GA ) modulates PKC activity and that PKC participates in mediating the GA-induced stimulation of matrix production</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To test this hypothesis , we examined the effects of PKC inhibitors on collagen type IV production by mouse or rat mesangial cells incubated with GA , and the influence of GA on PKC activity in these cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Increased collagen type IV production evoked by GA in 5.5 and 25 mM glucose in mouse mesangial cells was prevented by both general ( GF-109203X ) and beta-specific ( LY-379196 ) PKC inhibitors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Total PKC activity , measured by phosphorylation of a PKC-specific substrate , increased with time after exposure of rat mesangial cells to GA compared with the nonglycated , glucose-free counterpart .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">GA caused an increase in PKC-beta1 membrane-bound fraction and in total PKC activity in media containing physiological ( 5.5 mM ) glucose concentrations in rat mesangial cells , confirming that the glucose-modified protein , and <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> a " hyperglycemic " milieu</scope> , was responsible .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The findings <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> Amadori-modified albumin stimulates mesangial cell PKC activity , and that activation of the PKC-beta isoform is linked to the stimulation of collagen type IV production</scope> .</sentence>
