<sentence id="0">Extracellular and cytoplasmic CuZn superoxide dismutases from Brugia lymphatic filarial nematode parasites .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have isolated full-length cDNAs encoding two distinct types of CuZn superoxide dismutases ( SODs ) from the filarial nematode parasite Brugia pahangi .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The derived amino acid sequences <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that one class of cDNAs represented a cytoplasmic form of SOD and the second class represented an extracellular ( EC ) variant</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The predicted proteins were highly homologous to each other , but the sequence of the latter contained an additional 43 residues at the N terminus , the first 16 of which were markedly hydrophobic , and four potential sites for N-linked glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) with an antiserum to a partial SOD expressed in Escherichia coli revealed two proteins with estimated molecular masses of 19 and 29 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Digestion with N-glycanase <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> the latter protein corresponded to the EC form</scope> , as it possessed N-linked oligosaccharide chains at three sites , leaving a peptide backbone with an estimated molecular mass of 22 kDa , which was consistent with the additional 27 amino acids predicted from the cDNA sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Gel filtration <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated that</cue> both enzymes were dimeric in their native forms , in contrast to the human EC-SOD , which is tetrameric</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Comparison of the primary structure of the parasite EC-SOD with that of the human EC enzyme revealed two major differences : the N-terminal extension of the parasite enzyme was shorter by 25 residues , and it also <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">lacked</cue> the C-terminal charged extension which mediates binding to cell surface sulfated proteoglycans</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Lavage of Mongolian jirds infected intraperitoneally with Brugia malayi resulted in the recovery of filarial CuZn SODs , principally the EC form , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating that</cue> this form of SOD is secreted in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This EC enzyme <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> contribute to parasite persistence by neutralizing superoxide generated by activated leukocytes , thus acting as both an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory factor</scope> .</sentence>
