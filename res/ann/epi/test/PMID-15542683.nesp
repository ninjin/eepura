<sentence id="0">Hepatitis delta virus antigen is methylated at arginine residues , and methylation regulates subcellular localization and RNA replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hepatitis delta virus ( HDV ) contains a circular RNA which encodes a single protein , hepatitis delta antigen ( HDAg ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HDAg exists in two forms , a small form ( S-HDAg ) and a large form ( L-HDAg ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">S-HDAg can transactivate HDV RNA replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recent studies have shown that posttranslational modifications , such as phosphorylation and acetylation , of S-HDAg can modulate HDV RNA replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Here we show that S-HDAg can be methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase ( PRMT1 ) in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The major methylation site is at arginine-13 ( R13 ) , which is in the RGGR motif of an RNA-binding domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The methylation of S-HDAg is essential for HDV RNA replication , especially for replication of the antigenomic RNA strand to form the genomic RNA strand .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">An R13A mutation in S-HDAg inhibited HDV RNA replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The presence of a methylation inhibitor , S-adenosyl-homocysteine , also inhibited HDV RNA replication .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We further found that the methylation of S-HDAg affected its subcellular localization .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Methylation-defective HDAg lost the ability to form a speckled structure in the nucleus and also permeated into the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These results thus revealed a novel posttranslational modification of HDAg and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated</cue> its importance for HDV RNA replication</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">This and other results further showed that , unlike replication of the HDV genomic RNA strand , replication of the antigenomic RNA strand requires multiple types of posttranslational modification , including the phosphorylation and methylation of HDAg .</sentence>
