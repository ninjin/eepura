<sentence id="0">Frog prodermorphin expressed in mammalian cells is partly converted to the hydroxyproline containing precursor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Using recombinant vaccinia virus , we have expressed in mammalian cells the cDNA coding for the precursor of dermorphin , a D-alanine containing opioid peptide from the skin of the South American frog Phyllomedusa sauvagei .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HeLa cells and AtT-20 cells produced prodermorphin where proline-6 of dermorphin was partly hydroxylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This was demonstrated by digesting the partially purified precursors with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">After immunoprecipitation and separation by HPLC , two decapeptides were detected which differed by the presence of proline or hydroxy-proline at position 6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This demonstrates that HeLa cells as well as AtT-20 cells can perform the post-translational conversion of certain proline residues to hydroxyproline in a foreign hormone precursor expressed in these cells .</sentence>
