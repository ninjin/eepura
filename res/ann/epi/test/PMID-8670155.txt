Entry of polyunsaturated fatty acids into the brain: evidence that high-density lipoprotein-induced methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine and phospholipase A2 are involved. 
The conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) into phosphatidylcholine (PC) by a sequence of three transmethylation reactions is shown to be stimulated by the apolipoprotein E-free subclass of high-density lipoprotein (HDL3) in isolated bovine brain capillary (BBC) membranes, HDL3-induced stimulation of BBC membranes pulsed with [methyl-14C]methionine causes a transient increase in each methylated phospholipid, i.e. phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine (PMME), phosphatidyl-NN-dimethylethanolamine (PDME) and PC. PC substrate arising from the activation of PE N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is hydrolysed by a phospholipase A2 (PLA2), as demonstrated by the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC). When PE containing [14C]arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position ([14C]PAPE) is incorporated into BBC membranes, HDL3 stimulation induces the formation of PMME, PDME, PC and lyso-PC and the release of [14C]arachidonic acid, which correlates with the previous production of lyso-PC, suggesting that HDL3 stimulates a PLA2 that can release polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Both PEMT and PLA2 activities depend on a HDL3 concentration in the range 0-50 micrograms/ml and are strictly dependent on HDL3 binding, because HDL3 modified by tetranitromethane is no longer able to bind to specific receptors and to trigger PEMT and PLA2 activation. Moreover, HDL3 prelabelled with [14C]PAPE can stimulate PDME and lyso-PC synthesis in BBC membranes in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine, suggesting that HDL3 can supply BBC membranes in polyunsaturated PE and can activate enzymes involved in PE N-methylation and PUFA release. The results support the hypothesis of a close relationship between HDL3 binding, PE methylation and PUFA release, and suggest that the PC pool arising from PE could be used as a pathway for the supply of PUFA to the brain.
