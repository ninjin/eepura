<sentence id="0">Differential methylation pattern of ID4 , SFRP1 , and SHP1 between acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To gain insight into the differential mechanism of gene promoter hypermethylation in acute and chronic leukemia , we identified the methylation status on one part of 5'CpG rich region of 8 genes , DAB2IP , DLC-1 , H-cadherin , ID4 , Integrin alpha4 , RUNX3 , SFRP1 , and SHP1 in bone marrows from acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Also , we compared the methylation status of genes in AML and CML using methylation-specific PCR ( MSP ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The frequencies of DNA methylation of ID4 , SFRP1 , and SHP1 were higher in AML patients compared to those in CML patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> statistical difference between AML and CML</scope> was detected for other genes such as DLC-1 , DAB2IP , H-cadherin , Integrin alpha4 , and RUNX3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that these methylation-controlled genes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> have different roles in AML and CML</scope> , and thus , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> act as a biological marker of AML</scope></scope> .</sentence>
