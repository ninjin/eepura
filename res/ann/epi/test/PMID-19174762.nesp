<sentence id="0">Tolerance induction using lentiviral gene delivery delays onset and severity of collagen II arthritis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis remains suboptimal ; thus there is considerable interest in the development of strategies that mediate tolerance to autoantigens .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using lentiviral gene transfer in vivo , we expressed the immunodominant epitope of collagen type II ( CII ) on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules ( MHC II ) in a mouse model of destructive arthritis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">A sequence corresponding to amino acids 259-270 of CII was fused into the class II-associated invariant chain peptide ( CLIP ) position of the invariant chain to achieve efficient binding to MHC II .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transduction of cloned cells and primary antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) in vitro demonstrated successful presentation of the peptide on MHC II , and a physiological glycosylation pattern .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Compared with controls , mice intravenously injected with lentiviral vectors encoding this epitope displayed significantly less frequent , less severe , and less destructive arthritis , decreased lymphocyte proliferation in response to restimulation with CII , and lower CII-specific antibody levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">This was associated with an increased production of transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that overexpression of the immunodominant CII epitope on MHC II induces T cell production of TGF-beta and leads to inhibition of arthritis by means of both antigen-specific and bystander mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , antigen-specific tolerance induction using lentiviral gene delivery can ameliorate arthritis .</sentence>
