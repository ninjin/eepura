<sentence id="0">Regulated expression allows high level production and secretion of HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein in Drosophila Schneider cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have established a stable , continuous culture Drosophila Schneider 2 cell line that efficiently expresses a secreted , truncated form of the HIV envelope gp120 protein in a regulated manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The Drosophila produced recombinant gp120 protein is highly glycosylated , is recognized by gp120-specific monoclonal antibodies , binds to the CD4 receptor and has the ability to inhibit syncytia formation between uninfected CD4+ cells and HIV infected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We conclude that this recombinant Drosophila envelope protein is an appropriate mimic of the authentic viral envelope protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Thus , the Drosophila cell provides a continuous , stable culture system for the efficient expression of secreted forms of complex surface glycoproteins in quantities sufficient for detailed analyses .</sentence>
