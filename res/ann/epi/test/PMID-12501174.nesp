<sentence id="0">Histidine 407 , a phantom residue in the E1 subunit of the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex , activates reductive acetylation of lipoamide on the E2 subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An explanation for conservation of active sites between the E1 subunit and transketolase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Least squares alignment of the E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex E1 subunit and yeast transketolase crystal structures <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates</cue> a general structural similarity between the two enzymes</scope> and provides a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">plausible</cue> location for a short-loop region in the E1 structure that was unobserved due to disorder</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The residue H407 , located in this region , is shown to be able to penetrate the active site .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Suggested by this comparison , the H407A E1 variant was created , and H407 was shown to participate in the reductive acetylation of both an independently expressed lipoyl domain and the intact 1-lipoyl E2 subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">While the H407A substitution only modestly affected the reaction through pyruvate decarboxylation ( ca. 14 % activity compared to parental E1 ) , the overall complex has a much impaired activity , at most 0.15 % compared to parental E1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements show that the binding of the lipoyl domain to the H407A E1 variant is much weaker than that to parental E1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">At the same time , mass spectrometric measurements clearly demonstrate much impaired reductive acetylation of the independently expressed lipoyl domain and of the intact 1-lipoyl E2 by the H407A variant compared to the parental E1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">proposal</cue> is presented to explain the remarkable conservation of the three-dimensional structure at the active centers of the E. coli E1 subunit and transketolase on the basis of the parallels in the ligation-type reactions carried out and the need to protonate a very weak acid , a dithiolane sulfur atom in the former , and a carbonyl oxygen atom in the latter</scope> .</sentence>
