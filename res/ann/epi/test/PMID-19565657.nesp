<sentence id="0">Proteasome inhibition modulates kinase activation in neural cells : relevance to ubiquitination , ribosomes , and survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">In this study we examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> established signal transduction cascades , p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( ERK1/2 ) and Jun N-terminal kinases ( JNK ) pathways , are altered in N2a neural cells in response to proteasome inhibition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Additionally , we sought to elucidate the relative contribution of these signal transduction pathways to the multiple downstream effects of proteasome inhibition .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our data <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> ERK1/2 and JNK are activated in response to proteasome inhibition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Washout of proteasome inhibitor ( MG132 ) results in an enhancement of ERK1/2 activation and amelioration of JNK activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment with an established MAPK inhibitor resulted in an increase in proteasome inhibitor toxicity , and incubation with JNK inhibitor was observed to attenuate proteasome inhibitor toxicity significantly .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Subsequent studies demonstrated that inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK activity does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> alter the gross increase in ubiquitinated protein following proteasome inhibitor administration</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similarly , <scope type="spec" id="4"> ERK1/2 and JNK activity do <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="4">appear</cue> to play a role in the disruption of polysomes following proteasome inhibitor administration in neural cells</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together these data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicate that</cue> ERK1/2 and JNK activation <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> play differential roles in modulating neurochemical disturbances and neurotoxicity induced by proteasome inhibition</scope></scope> .</sentence>
