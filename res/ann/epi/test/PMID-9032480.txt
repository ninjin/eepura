Biochemical analysis of a bladder-cancer-associated mucin: structural features and epitope characterization. 
Three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), M344, M300 and M75, were shown to define a unique tumour-associated antigen (TAA) of superficial bladder tumours. The antigenic determinants are expressed on a very-high-molecular-mass component and, in about 50% of the positive samples, one determinant is also detected on a 62 kDa molecular species, observed only under reducing conditions. The objectives of the present study were to characterize further this TAA by analysing (1) the biochemical nature of the epitopes recognized by the three mAbs, and (2) the biochemical and structural features of the molecule bearing them. The antigenicity was resistant to heat denaturation, trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin treatments but highly sensitive to papain and Pronase digestion. NaIO4 oxidation decreased reactivity to mAbs M344 and M300 but enhanced reactivity to mAb M75. The three determinants were insensitive to beta-galactosidase and alpha-L-fucosidase but were sensitive to Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. None of the three mAbs reacted with ovine, bovine or porcine submaxillary mucins. Deglycosylation with O-glycosidase or trifluoromethanesulphonic acid completely abolished the reactivity of the mAbs whereas N-glycosidase F deglycosylation had no appreciable effect. The presence on the molecule of cryptic Gal(beta(1-3))GalNAc as a major core disaccharide was demonstrated by a heterologous sandwich assay using mAb M75 and peanut agglutinin. Thiol reduction using beta-mercaptoethanol increased mobility of the high-molecular-mass component in polyacrylamide gels. We thus conclude that mAbs M344 and M300 react with sialylated carbohydrate epitopes, and mAb M75 reacts with a partially cryptic and periodate-resistant sialylated epitope expressed on a typical secreted high-molecular-mass oligomeric mucin which we named MAUB for mucin antigen of the urinary bladder.
