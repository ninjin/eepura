<sentence id="0">Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 interacts with and is ubiquitinated by ubiquitin ligase ROC1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6K ) is involved in the regulation of cell growth and cellular metabolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The activation of S6K in response to diverse extracellular stimuli is mediated by multiple phosphorylations coordinated by the mTOR and PI3K signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have recently found that both forms of S6K are modified by ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Following these findings , we demonstrate here for the first time that S6K1 associates specifically with ubiquitin ligase ROC1 in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The interaction was initially identified in the yeast two-hybrid screening and further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , the overexpression of ROC1 leads to an increase in S6K1 ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with this observation , we showed that the steady-state level of S6K1 is regulated by ROC1 , since downregulation of ROC1 by specific siRNA promotes stabilization of S6K1 protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> the involvement of ROC1 in S6K1 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation</scope> .</sentence>
