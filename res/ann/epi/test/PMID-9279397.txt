Ascorbate induction of collagen synthesis as a means for elucidating a mechanism of quantitative control of tissue-specific function. 
Ascorbic acid displays the characteristics of an ideal inducer of tissue-specific function in primary avian tendon cells in culture. It is a highly specific, potent stimulator of collagen synthesis, it demonstrates slow reversible kinetics, and it has no effect on growth rate of the cultured cells. Kinetic analysis of ascorbate induction of collagen synthesis was used to determine the critical steps in this complex biosynthetic pathway. Full hydroxylation of the proline residues in collagen, although probably a necessary step for collagen induction, was in itself not sufficient for achieving either increased secretion or increased synthesis. On the other hand, an increase in secretion rate, which required both the presence of ascorbate and a high cell density, did correlate with the later stimulation in procollagen production. The process of procollagen secretion, therefore, meets the minimal requirements for the rate-limiting step. The fact that the cells maintained a large pool of intracellular procollagen despite changes in the rates of translation or secretion led us to postulate a possible feedback between the level of the internal procollagen pool and the rate of procollagen synthesis.
