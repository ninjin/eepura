<sentence id="0">Mechanisms of c-myc degradation by nickel compounds and hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nickel ( Ni ) compounds have been found to cause cancer in humans and animal models and to transform cells in culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">At least part of this effect is mediated by stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF1a ) and activating its downstream signaling .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recent studies reported that hypoxia signaling <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> either antagonize or enhance c-myc activity depending on cell context</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We investigated the effect of nickel on c-myc levels , and demonstrated that nickel , hypoxia , and other hypoxia mimetics degraded c-myc protein in a number of cancer cells ( A549 , MCF-7 , MDA-453 , and BT-474 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The degradation of the c-Myc protein was mediated by the 26S proteosome .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Interestingly , knockdown of both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha attenuated c-Myc degradation induced by Nickel and hypoxia , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> the functional HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha was required for c-myc degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Further studies revealed two <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potential</cue> pathways</scope> mediated nickel and hypoxia induced c-myc degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Phosphorylation of c-myc at T58 was significantly increased in cells exposed to nickel or hypoxia , leading to increased ubiquitination through Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In addition , nickel and hypoxia exposure decreased USP28 , a c-myc de-ubiquitinating enzyme , contributing to a higher steady state level of c-myc ubiquitination and promoting c-myc degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , the reduction of USP28 protein by hypoxia signaling is due to both protein degradation and transcriptional repression .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Nickel and hypoxia exposure significantly increased the levels of dimethylated H3 lysine 9 at the USP28 promoter and repressed its expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our study demonstrated that Nickel and hypoxia exposure increased c-myc T58 phosphorylation and decreased USP28 protein levels in cancer cells , which both lead to enhanced c-myc ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
