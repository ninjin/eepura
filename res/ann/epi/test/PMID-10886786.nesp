<sentence id="0">Differences in the ligand specificity between CD1d-restricted T cells with limited and diverse T-cell receptor repertoire .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The natural killer ( NK ) T-lymphocyte population consists of two subsets utilizing a diverse and restricted T-cell receptor ( TCR ) repertoire , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Both populations have been shown to include autoreactive cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">NKT cells carrying restricted Valpha14(AV14S1)Jalpha281/Vbeta8.2(BV8S2A1 ) TCR have been shown to recognize alpha-galactosylceramide ( alphaGalCer ) presented in the context of murine CD1d .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study we screened a set of murine CD1d-autoreactive T-cell hybridomas with diverse TCR for their reactivity with several glycosylated variants of ceramide , including alphaGalCer .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These hybridomas showed a different pattern of reactivity to CD1d-expressing antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) and were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> reactive with any of the tested variants of ceramide</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A second set of hybridomas had been selected for expression of Valpha14 and Vbeta8.2 TCR chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These cells responded to alphaGalCer presented on CD1d , but were only weakly reactive to syngeneic splenocytes or CD1d-transfected cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Their fine specificity in the response to glycosylation variants of ceramide demonstrated a homogenous reactivity pattern , including reactivity to alpha-galactosylsphingosine , the variant of alphaGalCer with truncated fatty acyl chain .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings underline the differences in ligand specificity between the two subsets of CD1d-restricted NKT cells , and demonstrate a similarity in reactivity among the hybridomas using the Valpha14-Jalpha281/Vbeta8.2 TCR .</sentence>
