IgE receptor on human lymphocytes.  IV.  Further analysis of its structure and of the role of N-linked carbohydrates. 
Previous studies have shown that the low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R II) on human B lymphocytes was comprised of three components with apparent Mr of 45, 65 to 95, and 37 kDa. The present results indicate that the 37-kDa component is a soluble degradation fragment of the 45-kDa component and they also suggest that the 65- to 95-kDa component is probably made of aggregates of the above components that are formed after solubilization of the cells. The 45-kDa component appears to be a glycoprotein containing several sialic acid residues, O-linked carbohydrates and one N-linked carbohydrate chain that is of the complex type. Partial digestion of the purified 65- to 95-, 45-, and 37-kDa molecules with alpha-chymotrypsin or protease V8 generates several fragments with identical mobility on SDS-PAGE. The 37 kDa is not N-glycosylated but like the IgE-binding factors present in the culture supernatant of Fc epsilon R-bearing cells, it contains sialic acid and O-linked carbohydrates. On incubation with protease inhibitors, the Mr of IgE-binding factors (BF) is shifted from 25-27 to 37 kDa, indicating that IgE-BF are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the 37-kDa molecule, previously identified as a membrane component of Fc epsilon R. On incubation with N-glycosylation inhibitors, the production of IgE-BF is significantly increased indicating that N-glycosylation inhibits the degradation of Fc epsilon R into IgE-BF. Inasmuch as the effect of glycosylation inhibitors is not prevented by monensin, it is concluded that all the IgE-BF are derived from surface Fc epsilon R and not from their intracellular precursors.
