<sentence id="0">Cleavage of a hydrophilic C-terminal domain increases growth-inhibitory activity of oncostatin M.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oncostatin M is a polypeptide cytokine , produced by normal and malignant hematopoietic cells , that has several in vitro activities , including the ability to inhibit growth of cultured carcinoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we present a structural and functional comparison of two oncostatin M-related proteins ( Mr 36,000 and 32,000 ) secreted by COS cells transfected with oncostatin M cDNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The smaller of these forms <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacked</cue> a hydrophilic C-terminal domain comprising predominantly basic amino acids</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This domain was also absent from native oncostatin M produced by U937 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="neg" id="1">The 32,000-Mr form of oncostatin M was <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> produced by cells transfected with plasmids ( G195 and G196 ) in which a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potential</cue> trypsinlike cleavage site within the hydrophilic C-terminal domain</scope> was altered by site-directed mutagenesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A 32,000-Mr fragment was produced by trypsin treatment of the 36,000-Mr form of oncostatin M. These observations <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the 32,000-Mr form of oncostatin M was derived from the 227-amino-acid propeptide by proteolytic cleavage at <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">or</cue> near the paired basic residues at positions 195 and 196</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pro-oncostatin M was equally active in radioreceptor assays as the processed form but was 5- to 60-fold less active in growth inhibition assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Likewise , nonprocessed mutant protein encoded by plasmid G196 was equally active in the radioreceptor assays as the processed form but was five- to ninefold less active in growth inhibition assays .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , <scope type="neg" id="5">the highly charged C-terminal domain of pro-oncostatin M is <cue type="neg" id="5">not</cue> required for receptor binding or growth-inhibitory activity</scope> but <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> alter the functional properties of the molecule</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Propeptide processing of oncostatin M <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be important for regulating in vivo activities of this cytokine</scope> .</sentence>
