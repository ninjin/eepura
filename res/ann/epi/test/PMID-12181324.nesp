<sentence id="0">Sequence determinants in hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha for hydroxylation by the prolyl hydroxylases PHD1 , PHD2 , and PHD3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is a heterodimeric transcription factor induced by hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Under normoxic conditions , site-specific proline hydroxylation of the alpha subunits of HIF allows recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein ( VHL ) , a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets these subunits for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Under hypoxic conditions , this hydroxylation is inhibited , allowing the alpha subunits of HIF to escape VHL-mediated degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Three enzymes , prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins 1 , 2 , and 3 ( PHD1 , -2 , and -3 ; also known as HIF prolyl hydroxylase 3 , 2 , and 1 , respectively ) , have recently been identified that catalyze proline hydroxylation of HIF alpha subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These enzymes hydroxylate specific prolines in HIF alpha subunits in the context of a strongly conserved LXXLAP sequence motif ( where X <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates</cue> any amino acid and P</scope> <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates</cue> the hydroxylacceptor proline )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We report here that PHD2 has the highest specific activity toward the primary hydroxylation site of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , and unexpectedly , mutations can be tolerated at the -5 , -2 , and -1 positions ( relative to proline ) of the LXXLAP motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , these results provide evidence that the only obligatory residue for proline hydroxylation in HIF-1alpha is the hydroxylacceptor proline itself .</sentence>
