<sentence id="0">The envelope protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus interacts with the non-structural protein 3 and is ubiquitinated .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To analyze the proteins interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) envelope ( E ) protein , a SARS-CoV was engineered including two tags associated to the E protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Using this virus , complexes of SARS-CoV E and other proteins were purified using a tandem affinity purification system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Several viral and cell proteins including spike , membrane , non-structural protein 3 ( nsp3 ) , dynein heavy chain , fatty acid synthase and transmembrane protein 43 bound E protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present work , we focused on the binding of E protein to nsp3 in infected cells and cell-free systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This interaction was mediated by the N-terminal acidic domain of nsp3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , nsp3 and E protein colocalized during the infection .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It was shown that E protein was ubiquitinated in vitro and in cell culture , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the interaction between nsp3 and E protein <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play a role in the E protein ubiquitination status and therefore on its turnover</scope></scope> .</sentence>
