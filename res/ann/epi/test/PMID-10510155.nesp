<sentence id="0">Evidence for involvement of polymorphic CYP2C19 and 2C9 in the N-demethylation of sertraline in human liver microsomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">AIMS : The present study was designed to define the kinetic behaviour of sertraline N-demethylation in human liver microsomes and to identify the isoforms of cytochrome P450 involved in this metabolic pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">METHODS : The kinetics of the formation of N-demethylsertraline were determined in human liver microsomes from six genotyped CYP2C19 extensive ( EM ) and three poor metabolisers ( PM ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Selective inhibitors of and specific monoclonal antibodies to various cytochrome P450 isoforms were also employed .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RESULTS : The kinetics of N-demethylsertraline formation in all EM liver microsomes were fitted by a two-enzyme Michaelis-Menten equation , whereas the kinetics in all PM liver microsomes were best described by a single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten equation similar to the low-affinity component found in EM microsomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mean apparent Km values for the high-and low-affinity components were 1.9 and 88 microm and V max values were 33 and 554 pmol min-1 mg-1 protein , respectively , in the EM liver microsomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Omeprazole ( a CYP2C19 substrate ) at high concentrations and sulphaphenazole ( a selective inhibitor of CYP2C9 ) substantially inhibited N-demethylsertraline formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Of five monoclonal antibodies to various cytochrome P450 forms tested , only anti-CYP2C8/9/19 had any inhibitory effect on this reaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The inhibition of sertraline N-demethylation by anti-CYP2C8/9/19 was greater in EM livers than in PM livers at both low and high substrate concentrations .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">However , anti-CYP2C8/9/19 did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> abolish the formation of N-demethylsertraline in the microsomes from any of the livers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSIONS : The polymorphic enzyme CYP2C19 catalyses the high-affinity N-demethylation of sertraline , while CYP2C9 is one of the low-affinity components of this metabolic pathway .</sentence>
