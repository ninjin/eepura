<sentence id="0">Cell cycle specific changes in the human cyclin B1 gene regulatory region as revealed by response to trichostatin A.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The human cyclin Bl gene is cell cycle regulated with maximal activity during G(2)/M .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We examined the role of histone deacetylation in cyclin Bl regulation using the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A ( TSA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">TSA treatment ( 100 ng/ml ) of NIH3T3 cells containing the luciferase reporter construct pCycB(-287)-LUC caused an increase in promoter activity in G(0) and G(1) but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> significant change in G(2)</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Removal of upstream sequences including an E-box and Sp1 site eliminated the TSA induced increase in G(0) and G(1) , and caused a decrease in promoter activity during S and G(2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Promoter activity increased only 2-fold following TSA treatment of G(0) cells containing the construct pCycB(MUT-E-Box)-LUC with an E-box mutation , and a decrease in activity was detected during G(2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We conclude that histone deacetylation contributes to the repression of cyclin B1 expression in G(0) and G(1) , and that this mechanism requires , in part , the E-box .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">TSA reduction of cyclin B1 promoter activity in G(2) , however , involves sequences within the first 119 bp .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A working model for cyclin B1 regulation is provided .</sentence>
