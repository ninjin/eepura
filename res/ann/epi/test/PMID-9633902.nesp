<sentence id="0">Methylation of the p16INK4A gene in multiple myeloma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The p16INK4A ( p16 ) binds to both cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin D-CDK6 and inhibits the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Loss of expression of this protein <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">can</cue> occur by several mechanisms including structural alterations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recent studies have <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that the loss of expression of p16 can occur by hypermethylation of the gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The methylation status of the p16 gene in multiple myeloma was examined in three myeloma cell lines ( U266 , RPMI8226 and IM9 ) and 16 primary myeloma samples using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ( MSP ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The U266 and RPMI8226 cell lines contained a completely methylated p16 gene and the IM9 line had a partially methylated p16 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Identical results were obtained by another polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methylation assay system as well as Southern blotting after using a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The U266 cell line expressed <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> p16</scope> , and the IM9 had weak expression as determined by reverse transcript (RT-)PCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The U266 cells began to express , and IM9 increased the accumulation of , the p16 RNA after treatment with the demethylating agent 5'-aza-2-deoxycytidine ( 10(-6)-10(-5) M ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggested</cue> that the levels of methylation of the p16 gene detected by the MSP technique correlated with the regulation of transcription of this gene</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Examination of the primary myeloma samples showed that eight of 16 ( 50 % ) contained a methylated p16 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We have previously found that alterations of the p16 gene , such as deletions and point mutations , are rare in primary multiple myeloma ; <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">none</cue> of the 16 samples included in this study had p16 gene alterations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our results <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that methylation of the p16 gene <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> contribute to the development and/or progression of multiple myeloma</scope></scope> .</sentence>
