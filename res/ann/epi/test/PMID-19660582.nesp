<sentence id="2">We have shown that as in yeast , components of the 19S proteasome are crucial for regulating inducible histone acetylation events in mammalian cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The 19S ATPase Sug1 binds to histone acetyltransferases and to acetylated histone H3 and , in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of Sug1 , histone H3 acetylation</scope> is dramatically decreased at mammalian promoters .</sentence>

<sentence id="5">To characterize the role that the 19S proteasome plays in regulating additional activating modifications , we examined the methylation and ubiquitination status of histones at inducible mammalian genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We find that Sug1 is crucial for regulating histone H3K4me3 and H3R17me2 at the cytokine inducible MHC-II and CIITA promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">absence</cue> of Sug1</scope> , histone H3K4me3 and H3R17me2 are dramatically decreased , but the loss of Sug1 has <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> significant effect on H3K36me3 or H2BK120ub</scope> .</sentence>
