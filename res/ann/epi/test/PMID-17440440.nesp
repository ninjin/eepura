<sentence id="0">A dual role of EGFR protein tyrosine kinase signaling in ubiquitination of AAV2 capsids and viral second-strand DNA synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A 52 kd cellular protein , FK506-binding protein ( FKBP52 ) , phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase ( EGFR-PTK ) , inhibits adeno-associated virus 2 ( AAV2 ) second-strand DNA synthesis and transgene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">FKBP52 is dephosphorylated at tyrosine residues by T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase ( TC-PTP ) , and TC-PTP over-expression leads to improved viral second-strand DNA synthesis and improved transgene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In these studies , we observed that perturbation of EGFR-PTK signaling by a specific inhibitor , Tyrphostin 23 ( Tyr23 ) , augmented the transduction efficiency of the single-stranded AAV ( ssAAV ) vector as well as the self-complementary AAV ( scAAV ) vector .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Similarly , tyrosine-dephosphorylation of FKBP52 by TC-PTP resulted in increased transduction by both vectors .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that EGFR-PTK signaling also affects aspects of AAV transduction other than viral second-strand DNA synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We document that inhibition of EGFR-PTK signaling leads to decreased ubiquitination of AAV2 capsids which , in turn , facilitates nuclear transport by limiting proteasome-mediated degradation of AAV vectors .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We also document that <scope type="neg" id="1">Tyr23-mediated increase in AAV2 transduction efficiency is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> further enhanced by a specific proteasome inhibitor , MG132</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , EGFR-PTK signaling modulates ubiquitin (Ub)/proteasome pathway-mediated intracellular trafficking as well as FKBP52-mediated second-strand DNA synthesis of AAV2 vectors .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This has implications in the optimal use of AAV vectors in gene therapy .</sentence>
