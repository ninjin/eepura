<sentence id="0">Characterization of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase from Acanthamoeba castellanii .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The kinetic properties of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase ( GlcNAc-phosphotransferase ) partially purified from the soil amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii have been studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The transferase phosphorylated the lysosomal enzymes uteroferrin and cathepsin D 3-90-fold better than nonlysosomal glycoproteins and 16-83-fold better than a Man9GlcNAc oligosaccharide .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Deglycosylated uteroferrin was a potent competitive inhibitor of the phosphorylation of intact uteroferrin ( Ki of 48 microM ) but did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> inhibit the phosphorylation of RNase B or the simple sugar alpha-methylmannoside</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Deglycosylated RNase ( RNase A ) did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> inhibit the phosphorylation of RNase B or uteroferrin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicate that</cue> purified amoeba GlcNAc-phosphotransferase recognizes a protein domain present on lysosomal enzymes but absent in most nonlysosomal glycoproteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The transferase also exhibited a marked preference for oligosaccharides containing mannose alpha 1,2-mannose sequences , but this cannot account for the high affinity binding to lysosomal enzymes .</sentence>
