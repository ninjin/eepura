<sentence id="0">The colR4 and colR15 beta-tubulin mutations in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii confer altered sensitivities to microtubule inhibitors and herbicides by enhancing microtubule stability .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The colR4 and colR15 beta 2-tubulin missense mutations for lysine-350 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( Lee and Huang , 1990 ) were originally isolated by selection for resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of colchicine .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The colR4 and colR15 mutants have been found to be cross resistant to vinblastine and several classes of antimitotic herbicides , including the dinitroanilines ( oryzalin , trifluralin , profluralin , and ethafluralin ) ; the phosphoric amide amiprophos methyl ; and the dimethyl propynl benzamide pronamide .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Like colchicine and vinblastine , the antimitotic effects of these plant-specific herbicides have been associated with the depolymerization of microtubules .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast to their resistance to microtubule-depolymerizing drugs , the mutants have an increased sensitivity to taxol , a drug which enhances the polymerization and stability of microtubules .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This pattern of altered sensitivity to different microtubule inhibitors was found to cosegregate and corevert with the beta-tubulin mutations providing the first genetic evidence that the in vivo herbicidal effects of the dinitroanilines , amiprophos methyl , and pronamide are related to microtubule function .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although wild-type like in their growth characteristics , the colR4 and colR15 mutants were found to have an altered pattern of microtubules containing acetylated alpha-tubulin , a posttranslational modification that has been associated with stable subsets of microtubules found in a variety of cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Microtubules in the interphase cytoplasm and those of the intranuclear spindle of mitotic cells , which in wild-type Chlamydomonas cells do <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> contain acetylated alpha-tubulin</scope> , were found to be acetylated in the mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data taken together <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the colR4 and colR15 missense mutations increase the stability of the microtubules into which the mutant beta-tubulins are incorporated and that the altered drug sensitivities of the mutants are a consequence of this enhanced microtubule stability</scope> .</sentence>
