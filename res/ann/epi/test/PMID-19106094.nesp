<sentence id="0">Deubiquitination of CXCR4 by USP14 is critical for both CXCL12-induced CXCR4 degradation and chemotaxis but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> ERK ativation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays important roles in the immune and nervous systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Abnormal expression of CXCR4 contributes to cancer and inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although ligand-dependent CXCR4 ubiquitination is known to accelerate CXCR4 degradation , little is known about counter mechanisms for receptor deubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">CXCL12 , a CXCR4 agonist , induces a time-dependent association of USP14 with CXCR4 , or its C terminus , <scope type="neg" id="1">that is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> mimicked by USP2A , USP4 , or USP7 , other members of the deubiquitination catalytic family</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Co-localization of CXCR4 and USP14 also is time-dependent following CXCL12 stimulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The physical interaction of CXCR4 and USP14 is paralleled by USP14-catalyzed deubiquitination of the receptor ; knockdown of endogenous USP14 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) blocks CXCR4 deubiquitination , whereas overexpression of USP14 promotes CXCR4 deubiquitination .</sentence>
