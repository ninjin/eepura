<sentence id="0">Jmjd1a demethylase-regulated histone modification is essential for cAMP-response element modulator-regulated gene expression and spermatogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Spermatogenesis , a fundamental process in the male reproductive system , requires a series of tightly controlled epigenetic and genetic events in germ cells ranging from spermatogonia to spermatozoa .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Jmjd1a is a key epigenetic regulator expressed in the testis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It specifically demethylates mono- and di-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 ) but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> tri-methylated H3K9 ( H3K9me3 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we generated a Jmjd1a antibody for immunohistochemistry and found Jmjd1a was specifically produced in pachytene and secondary spermatocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Disruption of the Jmjd1a gene in mice significantly increased H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 levels in pachytene spermatocytes and early elongating spermatids <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> affecting H3K9me3 levels</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Concurrently , the levels of histone acetylation were decreased in Jmjd1a knock-out germ cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> Jmjd1a promotes transcriptional activation by lowering histone methylation and increasing histone acetylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Interestingly , the altered histone modifications in Jmjd1a-deficient germ cells caused diminished cAMP-response element modulator ( Crem ) recruitment to chromatin and decreased expression of the Crem coactivator Act and their target genes Tnp1 ( transition protein 1 ) , Tnp2 , Prm1 ( protamine 1 ) , and Prm2 , all of which are essential for chromatin condensation in spermatids .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In agreement with these findings , Jmjd1a deficiency caused extensive germ cell apoptosis and blocked spermatid elongation , resulting in severe oligozoospermia , small testes , and infertility in male mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> the Jmjd1a-controlled epigenetic histone modifications are crucial for Crem-regulated gene expression and spermatogenesis</scope> .</sentence>
