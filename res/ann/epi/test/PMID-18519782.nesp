<sentence id="1">PURPOSE : Chemotherapy can be an integral component of the adjuvant management strategy for women with early stage breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To date , no tool is available to predict or monitor the efficacy of these therapies .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The aim of this proof-of-principle study was to assess <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> NEUROD1 DNA methylation is able to predict the response to neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Recently , we showed that NEUROD1 DNA is differentially methylated in neoplastic versus nonneoplastic breast tissue samples .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we used MethyLight and analyzed NEUROD1 methylation in ( a ) 74 breast cancer tissue samples , ( b ) two independent sets of pretreatment core biopsies of 23 ( training set ) and 21 ( test set ) neoadjuvantly treated breast cancer patients , and ( c ) pretherapeutic and posttherapeutic serum samples from 107 breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : High-grade tumors showed higher NEUROD1 methylation levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="1"> Estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers with high NEUROD1 methylation were 10.8-fold more <cue type="spec" id="1">likely</cue> to respond with a complete pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Patients with positive serum pretreatment NEUROD1 methylation , which persisted after chemotherapy , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicated</cue> poor relapse-free and overall survival in univariate and multivariate analyses ( relative risk for relapse , 6.2 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.6-24 ; P = 0.008 , and relative risk for death , 14 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.6-120 ; P = 0.02 )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSIONS : These data support the view that NEUROD1 methylation is a chemosensitivity marker in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer .</sentence>
