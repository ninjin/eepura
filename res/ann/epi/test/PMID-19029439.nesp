<sentence id="0">Processing of hemojuvelin requires retrograde trafficking to the Golgi in HepG2 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hemojuvelin ( HJV ) was recently identified as a critical regulator of iron homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is either associated with cell membranes through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or released as a soluble form .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Membrane-anchored HJV acts as a coreceptor for bone morphogenetic proteins and activates the transcription of hepcidin , a hormone that regulates iron efflux from cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Soluble HJV antagonizes bone morphogenetic protein signaling and suppresses hepcidin expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , we examined the trafficking and processing of HJV .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cellular HJV reached the plasma membrane <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> obtaining complex oligosaccharides</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> HJV avoided Golgi processing</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Secreted HJV , in contrast , has complex oligosaccharides and can be derived from HJV with high-mannose oligosaccharides at the plasma membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our results support a model in which retrograde trafficking of HJV before cleavage is the predominant processing pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Release of HJV requires it to bind to the transmembrane receptor neogenin .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Neogenin does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> , however , play a role in HJV trafficking to the cell surface</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that it could be involved <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">either</cue> in retrograde trafficking of HJV or in cleavage leading to HJV release</scope></scope> .</sentence>
