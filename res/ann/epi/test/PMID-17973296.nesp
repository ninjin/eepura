<sentence id="0">Flavonoids-induced accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha/2alpha is mediated through chelation of iron .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) is the regulatory subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF-1 that is the key regulator of cellular response to low oxygen tension .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Under normoxic conditions , HIF-1alpha is continuously degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through pVHL ( von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Under hypoxic conditions , HIF-1alpha is stabilized and induces the transcription of HIF-1 target genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Quercetin , a flavonoid with anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory , and kinase modulating properties , has been found to induce HIF-1alpha accumulation and VEGF secretion in normoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this study , the molecular mechanisms of quercetin-mediated HIF-1alpha accumulation were investigated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Previous studies have shown that , in addition to being induced by hypoxia , HIF-1alpha can be induced through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and p53 signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">But our study revealed , through p53 mutant-type as well as p53 null cell lines , that <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">neither</cue> the PI3K/Akt <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">nor</cue> the p53 signaling pathway</scope> is required for quercetin-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">And we observed that <scope type="neg" id="2">HIF-1alpha accumulated by quercetin is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> ubiquitinated</scope> and the interaction of HIF-1alpha with pVHL is reduced , compared with HIF-1alpha accumulated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The use of quercetin 's analogues showed that only quercetin and galangin induce HIF-1/2alpha accumulation and this effect is completely reversed by additional iron ions .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This is because quercetin and galangin are able to chelate cellular iron ions that are cofactors of HIF-1/2alpha proline hydroxylase ( PHD ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that quercetin inhibits the ubiquitination of HIF-1/2alpha in normoxia by hindering PHD through chelating iron ions</scope> .</sentence>
