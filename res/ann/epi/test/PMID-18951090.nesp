<sentence id="0">Arginine methylation of FOXO transcription factors inhibits their phosphorylation by Akt.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Forkhead box O ( FOXO ) transcription factors , the key regulators of cell survival , are negatively controlled through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Phosphorylation of FOXO by Akt leads to cytoplasmic localization and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show a paradigm of FOXO1 regulation by the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PRMT1 methylated FOXO1 at conserved Arg248 and Arg250 within a consensus motif for Akt phosphorylation ; this methylation directly blocked Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 at Ser253 in vitro and in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Silencing of PRMT1 by small interfering RNA enhanced nuclear exclusion , polyubiquitination , and proteasomal degradation of FOXO1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">PRMT1 knockdown led to a decrease in oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis depending on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , stable expression of enzymatic inactive PRMT1 mutant increased resistance to apoptosis , whereas this effect was reversed by expression of phosphorylation-deficient FOXO1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our findings predict a role for arginine methylation as an inhibitory modification against Akt-mediated phosphorylation .</sentence>
