<sentence id="0">Characterization of hARD2 , a processed hARD1 gene duplicate , encoding a human protein N-alpha-acetyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Protein acetylation is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism regulating a variety of cellular functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several human protein acetyltransferases have been characterized , most of them catalyzing epsilon-acetylation of histones and transcription factors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We recently described the human protein acetyltransferase hARD1 ( human Arrest Defective 1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">hARD1 interacts with NATH ( N-Acetyl Transferase Human ) forming a complex expressing protein N-terminal alpha-acetylation activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RESULTS : We here describe a human protein , hARD2 , with 81 % sequence identity to hARD1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The gene encoding hARD2 most <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> originates from a eutherian mammal specific retrotransposition event</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">hARD2 mRNA and protein are expressed in several human cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Immunoprecipitation experiments show that hARD2 protein <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potentially</cue> interacts with NATH , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that hARD2-NATH complexes <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be responsible for protein N-alpha-acetylation in human cells</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In NB4 cells undergoing retinoic acid mediated differentiation , the level of endogenous hARD1 and NATH protein decreases while the level of hARD2 protein is stable .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSION : A human protein N-alpha-acetyltransferase is herein described .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">ARD2 <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">potentially</cue> complements the functions of ARD1 , adding more flexibility and complexity to protein N-alpha-acetylation in human cells as compared to lower organisms which only have one ARD</scope> .</sentence>
