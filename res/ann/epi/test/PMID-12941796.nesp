<sentence id="0">BP75 , bromodomain-containing M(r) 75,000 protein , binds dishevelled-1 and enhances Wnt signaling by inactivating glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To identify novel regulators of Wnt signaling , we performed yeast two-hybrid analyses with Dvl-1 and identified BP75 as a candidate .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we demonstrated that BP75 directly interacts with Dvl-1 in mammalian cells and enhances TCF-dependent gene expression induced by Dvl-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In support of these results , BP75 in cooperation with Dvl-1 was found to facilitate dephosphorylation at Tyr216 of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and consequently inhibit its kinase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , the nuclear translocation and formation of vesicular structures of beta-catenin were induced by BP75 and Dvl-1 in a synergistic manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Collectively , these results provided us a novel mechanism in Wnt signaling where BP75 plays important regulatory roles between glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and Dvl.</sentence>
