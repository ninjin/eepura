<sentence id="0">PTPIP51 mRNA and protein expression in tissue microarrays and promoter methylation of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate carcinoma .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 ( PTPIP51 ) shows a tissue-specific expression pattern and is associated with cellular differentiation and apoptosis in several mammalian tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Overexpression of the full-length protein enhances apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It is also expressed in various carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study the expression of PTPIP51 and its in vitro interaction partners was investigated in human benign prostate hyperplasia ( BPH ) and in prostate carcinoma ( PCa ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">METHODS : Tissue microarrays of human BPH and PCa were analyzed by immunohistochemistry .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">For polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , cryo samples of BPH and PCa were used .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Bisulfite DNA treatment , followed by sequencing of PCR products was performed in order to analyze CpGs methylation within the promoter region of the PTPIP51 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">RESULTS : PTPIP51 mRNA and protein expression was detected in prostatic epithelia of BPH and in tumor cells of PCa , respectively , and within smooth muscle cells of the stromal compartment .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">A stronger expression was present in nerve fibers , particularly in PCa , in immune cells and in smooth muscle and endothelial cells of vessels of BPH and PCa .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">On mRNA levels , a slightly elevated expression of PTPIP51 was observed in the PCa group as tested by real-time quantitative PCR analyses .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Methylation experiments revealed that at least 70 % of methylated CpGs in the CpG island of the PTPIP51 gene promoter region were identified in BPH samples .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In contrast , a loss of methylation has been found in the PCa group .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSION : The promoter methylation status of PTPIP51 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">seems</cue> to influence the expression of PTPIP51 , which was seen as elevated in the PCa</scope> .</sentence>
