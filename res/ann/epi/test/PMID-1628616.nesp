<sentence id="1">The Saccharomyces cerevisiae och1 mutant shows a deficiency in the mannose outer chain elongation at the non-permissive temperature .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have cloned the OCH1 gene by complementation of temperature sensitive ( ts ) phenotype for growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The integrant of OCH1 gene in the yeast chromosome can complement the ts phenotype and shows the same mapping position as that of the och1 mutation , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the cloned gene is the true gene for mutation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The OCH1 gene disruptant is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> lethal</scope> but ts for cell growth , and <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">lacks</cue> mannose outer chains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The OCH1 gene sequence predicts a 55 kDa protein consisting of 480 amino acids .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It contains four <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potential</cue> asparagine-linked ( N-linked ) glycosylation sites</scope> and a single transmembrane region near the N-terminus .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In vitro translation/translocation analysis revealed that the large C-terminal region of the OCH1 protein is located at the lumenal side of microsomal membranes with some sugar modification , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicating</cue> a type II membrane topology</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The OCH1 protein was detected in yeast membrane fractions as four forms of 58-66 kDa , which correspond to the size of a glycoprotein containing four N-linked sugar chains the length of which is almost the same or slightly larger than the inner core ( Man8GlcNAc2 ) formed in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Finally , the OCH1 gene was found to encode a novel mannosyltransferase which specifically transfers [14C]mannose to the unique acceptor , the core-like oligosaccharide of cell wall mannan accumulated in the och1 disruptant .</sentence>
