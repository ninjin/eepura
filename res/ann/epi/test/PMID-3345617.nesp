<sentence id="0">Pharmacogenetics of N-methylation : heritability of human erythrocyte histamine N-methyltransferase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histamine N-methyltransferase ( HNMT ) catalyzes the N tau-methylation of histamine .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">HNMT is present in many human tissues , including the red blood cell ( RBC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our study evaluated the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possible</cue> role of inheritance in the regulation of individual variations in human RBC HNMT activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HNMT activity was measured in RBC lysates from 241 members of 51 nuclear families .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">After correction for the gender-specific effects of age , the frequency distribution of RBC HNMT activities was unimodal , and activities varied threefold within 2 SDs of the mean .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The correlation of HNMT activities in RBCs from 45 pairs of spouses was only 0.070 , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> shared environment did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> result in similar activities among genetically unrelated individuals</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Correlation coefficients were also calculated for pairs of genetically related individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">All of these correlations were significant except the mother-oldest son correlation .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The majority of the correlations did <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> differ significantly from those predicted for a trait with a heritability of 1.0 ( 100 % )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Our results demonstrate a significant familial aggregation of human RBC HNMT activity and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggest</cue> that inheritance <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> play an important role in the regulation of variation in the activity of this N-methyltransferase enzyme in the human RBC</scope></scope> .</sentence>
