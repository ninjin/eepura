<sentence id="0">Biological methylation of myelin basic protein : enzymology and biological significance .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Myelin is a membrane characteristic of the nervous tissue and functions as an insulator to increase the velocity of the stimuli being transmitted between a nerve cell body and its target .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Myelin isolated from human and bovine nervous tissue is composed of approximately 80 % lipid and 20 % protein , and 30 % of the protein fraction constitutes myelin basic protein ( MBP ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">MBP has an unusual amino acid at Res-107 as a mixture of NG-monomethylarginine and NG , N'G-dimethylarginine .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The formation of these methylarginine derivatives is catalysed by one of the subtypes of protein methylase I , which specifically methylates Res-107 of this protein .</sentence>
