<sentence id="0">TRIM44 interacts with and stabilizes terf , a TRIM ubiquitin E3 ligase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Terf/TRIM17 is a member of the TRIM family of proteins , which is characterized by the RING finger , B-box , and coiled-coil domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we found that terf interacts with TRIM44 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Terf underwent ubiquitination in vitro in the presence of the E2 enzyme UbcH6 ; this <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> that terf exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It was also found that terf was conjugated with polyubiquitin chains and stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor in mammalian cells ; this <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that terf rendered itself susceptible to proteasomal degradation through polyubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We also found that TRIM44 inhibited ubiquitination of terf , and thus stabilized the protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The N-terminal region of TRIM44 contains a zinc-finger domain found in ubiquitin hydrolases ( ZF UBP ) and ubiquitin specific proteases ( USPs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">proposed</cue> that TRIM44 <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> function as a new class of the " USP-like-TRIM " which regulates the activity of associated TRIM proteins</scope></scope> .</sentence>
