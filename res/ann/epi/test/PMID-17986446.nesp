<sentence id="0">Down-regulation of Pkc1-mediated signaling by the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Regulated ubiquitination and degradation of signaling proteins have emerged as key mechanisms for modulating the strength and duration of signaling pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The reversible nature of the ubiquitination process as well as the large number and diversity of the deubiquitinating enzymes raise the possibility that <scope type="spec" id="0"> signaling pathways <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> be modulated by specific deubiquitinating enzyme(s)</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we provide evidence that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the Pkc1-mediated signaling pathway that controls the cell wall integrity is negatively regulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Disruption of the UBP3 gene leads to an enhanced activation of the cell wall integrity pathway MAPK Slt2 when cells are challenged with a variety of pathway activation agents such as pheromone and Congo red .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The ubp3 deletion mutants accumulate high levels of Pkc1 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> potential regulation of Pkc1 by Ubp3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Consistent with this , Pkc1 and Ubp3 interact in vivo , and the stability of Pkc1 is markedly increased in the ubp3 deletion mutants .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , disruption of the PKC1 gene , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> the genes</scope> that encode components downstream of Pkc1 , completely suppresses other phenotypes displayed by the ubp3 deletion mutants such as hyperactivation of the pheromone-responsive MAPK Fus3 ( Wang , Y. , and Dohlman , H. G. ( 2002 ) J. Biol. Chem. 277 , 15766-15772 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings demonstrate that Ubp3 can regulate Pkc1 by facilitating its destruction and provide the initial evidence that Pkc1 plays a positive role in modulating the parallel pheromone-signaling pathway .</sentence>
