<sentence id="1">The quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) discriminates between native and nonnative proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The latter are degraded by the ER-associated degradation ( ERAD ) pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Whereas many cytosolic and membrane components of this system are known , only few luminal players have been identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this study , we characterize ERFAD ( ER flavoprotein associated with degradation ) , an ER luminal flavoprotein that functions in ERAD .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Upon knockdown of ERFAD , the degradation of the ERAD model substrate ribophorin 332 is delayed , and the overall level of polyubiquitinated cellular proteins is decreased .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also identify the ERAD components SEL1L , OS-9 and ERdj5 , a known reductase of ERAD substrates , as interaction partners of ERFAD .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our data show that ERFAD facilitates the dislocation of certain ERAD substrates to the cytosol , and we discuss the findings in relation to a potential redox function of the protein .</sentence>
