<sentence id="0">FKBP25 , a novel regulator of the p53 pathway , induces the degradation of MDM2 and activation of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The p53 tumour suppressor protein is tightly controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase , mouse double minute 2 ( MDM2 ) , but maintains MDM2 expression as part of a negative feedback loop .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have identified the immunophilin , 25kDa FK506-binding protein ( FKBP25 ) , previously shown to be regulated by p53-mediated repression , as an MDM2-interacting partner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that FKBP25 stimulates auto-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of MDM2 , leading to the induction of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Depletion of FKBP25 by siRNA leads to increased levels of MDM2 and a corresponding reduction in p53 and p21 levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These data are consistent with the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">idea</cue> that FKBP25 contributes to regulation of the p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop</scope> .</sentence>
