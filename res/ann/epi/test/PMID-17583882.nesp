<sentence id="0">Mutational analysis of the myxovirescin biosynthetic gene cluster reveals novel insights into the functional elaboration of polyketide backbones .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It has been proposed that two acyl carrier proteins (ACPs)-TaB and TaE--and two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl synthases (HMGSs)--TaC and TaF--could constitute two functional ACP-HMGS pairs ( TaB/TaC and TaE/TaF ) responsible for the incorporation of acetate and propionate units into the myxovirescin A scaffold , leading to the formation of beta-methyl and beta-ethyl groups , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has been <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> that three more proteins--TaX and TaY , which are members of the superfamily of enoyl-CoA hydratases ( ECHs ) , and a variant ketosynthase ( KS ) TaK--are shared between two ACP-HMGS pairs , to give the complete set of enzymes required to perform the beta-alkylations</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="1"> The beta-methyl branch is <cue type="spec" id="1">presumably</cue> further hydroxylated ( by TaH ) and methylated to produce the methoxymethyl group observed in myxovirescin A. To substantiate this <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">hypothesis</scope></cue> , a series of gene-deletion mutants were created , and the effects of these mutations on myxovirescin production were examined</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As predicted , DeltataB and DeltataE ACP mutants revealed similar phenotypes to their associated HMGS mutants DeltataC and DeltataF , respectively , thus providing direct evidence for the role of TaE/TaF in the formation of the beta-ethyl branch and <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">implying</cue> a role for TaB/TaC in the formation of the beta-methyl group</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Production of myxovirescin A was dramatically reduced in a DeltataK mutant and abolished in both the DeltataX and the DeltataY mutant backgrounds .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Analysis of a DeltataH mutant confirmed the role of the cytochrome P450 TaH in hydroxylation of the beta-methyl group .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Taken together , these experiments support a model in which the discrete ACPs TaB and TaE are compatible only with their associated HMGSs TaC and TaF , respectively , and function in a substrate-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Both TaB and TaC are essential for myxovirescin production , and the TaB/TaC pair can rescue antibiotic production in the absence of either TaE or TaF .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Finally , the reduced level of myxovirescin production in the DeltataE mutant , relative to the DeltataF strain , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggests</cue> an additional function of the TaE ACP</scope> .</sentence>
