<sentence id="0">Recessive osteogenesis imperfecta caused by LEPRE1 mutations : clinical documentation and identification of the splice form responsible for prolyl 3-hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> be caused by mutations in LEPRE1</scope> , encoding prolyl 3-hydroxylase-1 ( P3H1 ) or in CRTAP , encoding cartilage associated protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These proteins constitute together with cyclophilin B ( CyPB ) the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex that hydroxylates the Pro986 residue in both the type I and type II collagen alpha1-chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODS : We screened LEPRE1 , CRTAP and PPIB ( encoding CyPB ) in a European/Middle Eastern cohort of 20 lethal/severe OI patients <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> a type I collagen mutation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RESULTS : Four novel homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations were identified in LEPRE1 in four probands .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Two probands survived the neonatal period , including one patient who is the eldest reported patient ( 17 7/12 years ) so far with P3H1 deficiency .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">At birth , clinical and radiologic features were hardly distinguishable from those in patients with autosomal dominant ( AD ) severe/lethal OI .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Follow-up data reveal that the longer lived patients develop a severe osteochondrodysplasia that overlaps with , but has some distinctive features from , AD OI .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A new splice site mutation was identified in two of the four probands , affecting only one of three LEPRE1 mRNA splice forms , detected in this study .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The affected splice form encodes a 736 amino acid ( AA ) protein with a " KDEL " endoplasmic reticulum retention signal .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">While western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis of fibroblast cultures revealed <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absence</cue> of this P3H1 protein</scope> , mass spectrometry and SDS-urea-PAGE data showed severe reduction of alpha1(I)Pro986 3-hydroxylation and overmodification of type I (pro)collagen chains in skin fibroblasts of the patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">CONCLUSION : These findings <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that the 3-hydroxylation function of P3H1 is restricted to the 736AA splice form</scope> .</sentence>
