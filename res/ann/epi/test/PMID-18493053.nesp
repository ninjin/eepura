<sentence id="0">Regulators of cellular levels of histone acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone acetylation levels are regulated through the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) and deacetylases ( HDACs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">While much is known about gene-specific control of histone acetylation , little is understood about how total or cellular levels of histone acetylation are regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To identify regulators of cellular levels of histone acetylation , we developed an immunofluorescence-based approach to screen the single-gene deletion library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for strains with significant reductions in cellular histone acetylation levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Of the 4848 mutants screened , we identified 63 strains with considerable cellular hypoacetylation of N-terminal lysines in histones H3 and H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The cellular hypoacetylation was validated for subsets of the identified strains through secondary screens including mass spectrometric analysis of individual lysines and chromatin immunoprecipitation of specific genomic loci .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Among the identified mutants were several members of the Ccr4-Not complex , V-type ATPases , and vacuolar protein-sorting complexes as well as genes with <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unknown</cue> functions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We show that Gcn5 , a major HAT in yeast , has diminished histone acetyltransferase activity in particular mutants , providing a <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">plausible</cue> explanation for reduction of cellular acetylation levels in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our findings have revealed unexpected and novel links between histone acetylation , Gcn5 HAT activity , and diverse processes such as transcription , cellular ion homeostasis , and protein transport .</sentence>
