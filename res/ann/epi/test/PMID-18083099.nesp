<sentence id="0">Histone crosstalk between H2B monoubiquitination and H3 methylation mediated by COMPASS .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">COMPASS , the yeast homolog of the mammalian MLL complex , is a histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4 ) methylase consisting of Set1 ( KMT2 ) and seven other polypeptides , including Cps35 , the only essential subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Histone H2B monoubiquitination by Rad6/Bre1 is required for both H3K4 methylation by COMPASS , and H3K79 methylation by Dot1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">However , the molecular mechanism for such histone crosstalk is poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we demonstrate that histone H2B monoubiquitination controls the binding of Cps35 with COMPASS complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Cps 35 is required for COMPASS ' catalytic activity in vivo , and the addition of exogenous purified Cps35 to COMPASS purified from a Deltarad6 background results in the generation of a methylation competent COMPASS .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Cps35 associates with the chromatin of COMPASS-regulated genes in a H2BK123 monoubiquitination-dependent but Set1-independent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Cps35 is also required for proper H3K79 trimethylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These findings offer insight into the molecular role of Cps35 in translating the H2B monoubiquitination signal into H3 methylation .</sentence>
