<sentence id="0">HIF prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases in the biological response to intracellular O(2) levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that plays a crucial role in mediating cellular responses to oxygen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Oxygen availability influences multiple steps in HIF activation and recent studies have <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> at least two steps in this process are governed by a novel mode of signal transduction involving enzymatic hydroxylation of specific amino acid residues in HIF-alpha subunits by a series of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent oxygenases</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These enzymes are non-haem iron enzymes that use dioxygen in the hydroxylation reaction and therefore provide a direct link between the availability of molecular oxygen and regulation of HIF .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Prolyl hydroxylation regulates proteolytic destruction of HIF-alpha by the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin ligase complex , whereas HIF-alpha asparaginyl hydroxylation regulates recruitment of transcriptional coactivators .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The involvement of at least two distinct types of 2-OG-dependent oxygenase in oxygen-regulated transcription <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that these enzymes <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be well suited to a role in cellular oxygen sensing</scope></scope> .</sentence>
