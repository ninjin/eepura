<sentence id="0">The Neurospora peptide:N-glycanase ortholog PNG1 is essential for cell polarity despite its <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lack</cue> of enzymatic activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Secretory proteins are subjected to a stringent endoplasmic reticulum-based quality control system that distinguishes aberrant from correctly folded proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase cleaves oligosaccharides from misfolded glycoproteins and prepares them for degradation by the 26 S proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast to abundant in vitro data on its enzymatic function , <scope type="spec" id="1"> the in vivo relevance of peptide:N-glycanase activity remains <cue type="spec" id="1">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that the PNG1 ortholog from the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora crassa is an essential protein , and its deletion results in strong polarity defects .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">PNG1 and its predicted binding partner RAD23 have distinct functions in N. crassa and are involved in cell wall integrity and DNA repair , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , wild type PNG1 has substitutions in essential catalytic amino acids , and its deglycosylation activity is lost .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These substitutions are conserved in many PNG1 orthologs of the fungal kingdom , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">implying</cue> a so far unrecognized enzyme-independent function of PNG1 that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> only become apparent in highly polar cells such as fungal hyphae</scope></scope> .</sentence>
