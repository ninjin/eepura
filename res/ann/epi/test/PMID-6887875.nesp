<sentence id="0">Guide-lines in the design of new antiestrogens and cytotoxic-linked estrogens for the treatment of breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Antiestrogens ( Tamoxifen ) are used for the treatment of breast cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However these compounds are also weak estrogens that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> stimulate tumor growth</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cytotoxic-linked estrogens ( Estradiol Mustard , Estracyt ) are devoid of major therapeutic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This led to search for new antiestrogens devoid of estrogenicity and for active cytotoxic-estrogens .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hydroxylation of C-4 of triphenylethylene antiestrogens ( tamoxifen , CI 628 and U 23,469 ) largely increases their binding affinity for the estrogen receptor ( ER ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Hydroxylation also increases the in vitro antitumor activity of the drugs as shown by their higher ability to inhibit the growth of the ER-positive cell line MCF-7 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Triphenylethylene antiestrogens contain an aminoethoxy side chain which appears essential for their physiological activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Removal of the chain of tamoxifen suppresses its antiestrogenicity and antitumor activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The grafting of side chains on a weak estrogen of the gem-diphenylethylene category produces " symmetrical " antiestrogens devoid of estrogenic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This observation raises the question of the role played by the third phenyl ring of the triphenylethylenes since the trans-isomers of the latter display antiestrogenicity and the cis-isomers estrogenicity .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Comparison of the binding affinity for ER and antitumor activity of di- and triphenylethylene antiestrogens <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that this third phenyl ring increases the interaction with ER of the 4-phenolic group of the drugs and/or their aminoethoxy side chain</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">An analogue of this chain is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> any biological activity</scope> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that the di-(tri)pheny-lalkene structure is required for promoting the interaction of the chain with ER</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">New chemical structures yielding antiestrogens with antitumor activity are also reviewed .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">New cytotoxic estrogens designed for producing lethal damage of DNA show a low binding affinity for ER .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Moreover , there is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> evidence <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> specific antitumor activity</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">Such activity <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> be more easily obtained with estrogens bearing reagents for proteins <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">rather than</cue> DNA</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">The biological properties of a 2-mesylate derivative of estrone irreversibly interacting with ER supports the concept .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">On MCF-7 cells , the drug displays a strong antitumor activity which can only be suppressed by high , equimolar , concentrations of estradiol .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">It is devoid of cytotoxic activity on the ER-negative cell line Evsa-T <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">suggesting</cue> that ER is involved in its action</scope> .</sentence>
