Comparison of O-linked carbohydrate chains in MUC-1 mucin from normal breast epithelial cell lines and breast carcinoma cell lines.  Demonstration of simpler and fewer glycan chains in tumor cells. 
MUC-1 mucin is considered to be aberrantly glycosylated in breast, ovary, and other carcinomas in comparison with mucin from corresponding normal tissues. In order to clarify these differences in glycosylation, we have compared the O-linked carbohydrate chains from MUC-1 immunoprecipitated from [3H]GlcN-labeled breast epithelial cell lines (MMSV1-1, MTSV1-7, and HB-2) derived from cells cultured from human milk, with three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, BT-20, and T47D). Analysis by high pH anion chromatography showed that the normal cell lines had a higher ratio of GlcN/GalN and more complex oligosaccharide profiles than the cancer cell lines. Structural analyses were carried out on the oligosaccharides from MTSV1-7 and T47D MUC-1, and the following structures were proposed. MUC-1 from T47D had rather a simple glycosylation pattern, with NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-3GalNAc-ol, Galbeta1-3GalNAc-ol, and GalNAc-ol predominating; in contrast, MUC-1 from MTSV1-7 had more complex structures, including a number of disialo, core 2 species, i.e. NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-6[NeuAcalpha2 -3Galbeta1-3]GalNAc- ol and NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-6[NeuAcalpha2 -3Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbet a1-3Galbeta1-3]GalNAc-ol. Double-labeling experiments with [3H]GlcN and 14C-aminoacids and analysis of GalNAc or GalNAc-ol:protein ratios in MUC-1 showed that there was also a significant difference in the degree of glycosylation of the mucin between the two cell types. We conclude that MUC-1 from breast cancer cell lines has simpler, and fewer, carbohydrate chains than MUC-1 from normal breast epithelial cells, and that these differences, combined or separately, explain the differential tumor specificity of some MUC-1 antibodies and T cells.
