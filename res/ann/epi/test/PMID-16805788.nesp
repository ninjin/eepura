<sentence id="0">Enhancement of CD8 T-cell function through modifying surface glycoproteins in young and old mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previous work from our laboratory has shown that modifying cell surface glycosylation with either a Clostridium perfringens-derived sialidase ( CP-Siase ) , or an O-linked glycoprotein endopeptidase ( OSGE ) can enhance the function of CD4 T cells from both young and old mice at multiple levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we have re-assessed the effect of age on CD8 T-cell function , and examined the outcome of enzymatic treatment with CP-Siase and OSGE on its different aspects .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pre-treatment of CD8 T cells with either CP-Siase or OSGE led to a significant increase in anti-CD3-mediated Ca2+ response in both young and old mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Pre-treated CD8 T cells from both age groups also displayed a significant increase in activation-induced CD69 and CD25 expression , and produced significantly higher amounts of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma in comparison to their untreated counterparts .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , pretreatment with either enzyme enhanced granzyme B expression in CD8 T cells , and increased their cytolytic activity in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These data support the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">notion</cue> that glycosylated surface proteins hinder CD8 T-cell activation and function in both young and old mice</scope> , and raise the possibility of significantly improving CD8 T cell function in older individuals through enzymatic alteration of surface glycoproteins .</sentence>
