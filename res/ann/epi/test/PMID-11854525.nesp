<sentence id="0">Murine retroviruses activate B cells via interaction with toll-like receptor 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although most retroviruses require activated cells as their targets for infection , it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">not</cue> known how this is achieved in vivo</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A candidate protein for the activation of B cells by either mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) or murine leukemia virus is the toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , a component of the innate immune system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">MMTV caused B cell activation in C3H/HeN mice but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> in C3H/HeJ or BALB/c ( C.C3H Tlr4(lps-d) ) congenic mice</scope> , both of which have a mutant TLR4 gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This activation was independent of viral gene expression , because it occurred after treatment of MMTV with ultraviolet light or 2,2'-dithiodipyridine and in azidothymidine-treated mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Nuclear extracts prepared from the lymphocytes of MMTV-injected C3H/HeN but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> C3H/HeJ mice</scope> showed increased nuclear factor kappaB activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Additionally , the MMTV- and Moloney murine leukemia virus envelope proteins coimmunoprecipitated with TLR4 when expressed in 293T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The MMTV receptor <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">failed</cue> to coimmunoprecipitate with TLR4</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that MMTV/TLR4 interaction is independent of virus attachment and fusion</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These results identify retroviral proteins that interact with a mammalian toll receptor and show that direct activation by such viruses <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> initiate in vivo infection pathways</scope> .</sentence>
