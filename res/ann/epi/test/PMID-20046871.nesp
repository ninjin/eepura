<sentence id="0">Fgfr3 is a transcriptional target of Ap2delta and Ash2l-containing histone methyltransferase complexes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Polycomb ( PcG ) and trithorax ( trxG ) proteins play important roles in establishing lineage-specific genetic programs through induction of chromatin modifications that lead to gene silencing or activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previously , we described an association between the MLL/SET1 complexes and a highly restricted , gene-specific DNA-binding protein Ap2delta that is required for recruitment of the MLL/SET1 complex to target Hoxc8 specifically .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we reduced levels of Ap2delta and Ash2l in the neuroblastoma cell line , Neuro2A , and analyzed their gene expression profiles using whole-genome mouse cDNA microarrays .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This analysis yielded 42 genes <scope type="spec" id="0"> that are <cue type="spec" id="0">potentially</cue> co-regulated by Ap2delta and Ash2l</scope> , and we have identified evolutionarily conserved Ap2-binding sites in 20 of them .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">To determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> some of these were direct targets of the Ap2delta-Ash2l complex</scope> , we analyzed several promoters for the presence of Ap2delta and Ash2l by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Among the targets we screened , we identified Fgfr3 as a direct transcriptional target of the Ap2delta-Ash2l complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Additionally , we found that Ap2delta is necessary for the recruitment of Ash2l-containing complexes to this promoter and that this recruitment leads to trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 ( H3K4me3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , we have identified several candidate targets of complexes containing Ap2delta and Ash2l that can be used to further elucidate their roles during development and showed that Fgfr3 is a novel direct target of these complexes .</sentence>
