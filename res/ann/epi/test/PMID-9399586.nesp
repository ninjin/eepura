<sentence id="0">Functional expression of human mannan-binding proteins ( MBPs ) in human hepatoma cell lines infected by recombinant vaccinia virus : post-translational modification , molecular assembly , and differentiation of serum and liver MBP .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Human mannan-binding proteins ( MBPs ) occur in two forms , serum MBP ( S-MBP ) and liver MBP ( L-MBP ) , both of which are synthesized in the liver from a single form of human MBP mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate further the mechanisms of post-translational modification , molecular assembly and differentiation of S-MBP and L-MBP in vitro , we expressed a full-length human MBP cDNA in three human hepatoma cell lines , using the vaccinia virus expression system .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The expression of human MBP cDNA reproduced the native MBP differentiation of S-MBP and L-MBP in human hepatoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The recombinant S-MBP was secreted into the medium , and the recombinant L-MBP retained in the cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The former had the ability to activate the complement through the classical or lectin pathway but the latter did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , one notable difference between the two MBPs was the degree of oligomerization through interchain disulfide bonds between subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , we showed that both S-MBP and L-MBP undergo hydroxylation of lysine and proline residues in collagen-like sequences , and that the hydroxylysine is glycosylated to form glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine ( GluGalHyl ) and galactosylhydroxylysine ( GalHyl ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Hydroxylation was required for S-MBP to be assembled into large complexes , the apparent molecular sizes of which were estimated to be 200-1,300 kDa by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and gel filtration under non-denaturing conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The hydroxylation and subsequent glycosylation and oligomerization were inhibited by alpha , alpha'-dipyridyl , an inhibitor of collagen lysyl and prolyl hydroxylases .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> that newly synthesized lectins undergo post-translational modifications unique to the two forms of MBP , S-MBP , and L-MBP , in human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells , and that the collagen-like domains of the MBPs play an important role in promoting molecular assembly</scope> .</sentence>
