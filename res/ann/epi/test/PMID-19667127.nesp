<sentence id="0">Histone H2BK123 monoubiquitination is the critical determinant for H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation by COMPASS and Dot1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone H2B monoubiquitination by Rad6/Bre1 is required for the trimethylation of both histone H3K4 and H3K79 by COMPASS and Dot1 methyltransferases , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The dependency of methylation at H3K4 and H3K79 on the monoubiquitination of H2BK123 was recently challenged , and extragenic mutations in the strain background used for previous studies or epitope-tagged proteins were <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> to be the sources of this discrepancy</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we show that H3K4 and H3K79 methylation is solely dependent on H2B monoubiquitination regardless of any additional alteration to the H2B sequence or genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , we report that Y131 , one of the yeast histone H2A/H2B shuffle strains widely used for the last decade in the field of chromatin and transcription biology , carries a wild-type copy of each of the HTA2 and HTB2 genes under the GAL1/10 promoter on chromosome II .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Therefore , we generated the entire histone H2A and H2B alanine-scanning mutant strains in another background , which does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> express wild-type histones</scope> .</sentence>
