T1000	Speculation 985 994	suggested
E1000	Speculation:T1000 Scope:T1001
T1001	Span 985 1139	suggested a delayed acquisition of RAR full transcriptional competence because (i) cooperativity was maintained at RAR ligand subsaturating concentrations
T1002	Negation 905 908	not
E1001	Negation:T1002 Scope:T1003
T1003	Span 901 956	was not influenced by the spacing between the two RAREs
T1004	Speculation 1843 1853	suggesting
E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1843 2004	suggesting that RAR acts at the mRAR beta promoter by triggering the switch from an RNA elongation-incompetent RNAP form towards an RNA elongation-competent RNAP
T1006	Negation 1555 1558	not
E1003	Negation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 1529 1692	Loss of cooperativity was not correlated to local histone hyperacetylation or to alteration of constitutive RNA polymerase II (RNAP) loading at the promoter region
