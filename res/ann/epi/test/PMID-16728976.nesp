<sentence id="0">A PHD finger of NURF couples histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation with chromatin remodelling .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Lysine methylation of histones is recognized as an important component of an epigenetic indexing system demarcating transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin domains .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me3 ) marks transcription start sites of virtually all active genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recently , we reported that the WD40-repeat protein WDR5 is important for global levels of H3K4me3 and control of HOX gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that a plant homeodomain ( PHD ) finger of nucleosome remodelling factor ( NURF ) , an ISWI-containing ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complex , mediates a direct preferential association with H3K4me3 tails .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Depletion of H3K4me3 causes partial release of the NURF subunit , BPTF ( bromodomain and PHD finger transcription factor ) , from chromatin and defective recruitment of the associated ATPase , SNF2L ( also known as ISWI and SMARCA1 ) , to the HOXC8 promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Loss of BPTF in Xenopus embryos mimics WDR5 loss-of-function phenotypes , and compromises spatial control of Hox gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results strongly <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that WDR5 and NURF function in a common biological pathway in vivo</scope> , and that NURF-mediated ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling is directly coupled to H3K4 trimethylation to maintain Hox gene expression patterns during development .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We also identify a previously <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unknown</cue> function for the PHD finger</scope> as a highly specialized methyl-lysine-binding domain .</sentence>
