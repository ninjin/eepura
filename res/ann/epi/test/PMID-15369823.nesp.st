T1001	Span 2008 2124	suggest that both TAX1 and TAX19 acyltransferases may function at the early C5 acetylation step of taxoid metabolism

T1003	Span 464 578	thought to originate by intramolecular migration of a C5 acetate function in the process of oxetane ring formation

T1005	Span 2227 2335	may also function later in metabolism and be responsible for the production of many other acetylated taxoids

E1003	Speculation:T1006 Scope:T1007
T1007	Span 2058 2335	may function at the early C5 acetylation step of taxoid metabolism, and that the TAX19 acyltransferase, because of its broader specificity for polyhydroxylated taxoids, may also function later in metabolism and be responsible for the production of many other acetylated taxoids
