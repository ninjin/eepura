<sentence id="0">Serological reactivity and biochemical characterization of methylated and unmethylated forms of a recombinant protein fragment derived from outer membrane protein B of Rickettsia typhi .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Rickettsia typhi , an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes murine typhus , possesses a heavily methylated outer membrane protein B ( OmpB ) antigen .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This immunodominant antigen is responsible for serological reactions and is capable of eliciting protective immune responses with a guinea pig model .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Western blot analysis of partially digested OmpB with patient sera revealed that most of the reactive fragments are larger than 20 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One of these fragments , which is located at the N terminus ( amino acids 33 to 273 ) , fragment A ( At ) , has been expressed in Escherichia coli .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The expressed protein ( rAt ) was purified by chromatography and properly refolded by sequential dialysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The refolded rAt protein was recognized by at least 87 % of the typhus group patient sera as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , the titers were lower than those obtained with OmpB of R. typhi .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Since native OmpB is hypermethylated at lysine residues , we chemically methylated the lysine residues in rAt .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The methylation was confirmed by amino acid composition analysis , and the methylation pattern of the methylated rAt ( mrAt ) protein was similar to that of native At from OmpB , as revealed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Both rAt and mrAt were evaluated in an ELISA for their serological reactivity with patient sera .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Among patient sera tested , 83 % exhibited higher titers with mrAt than with rAt .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that rAt , with or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">without</cue> methylation</scope> , can <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> replace rickettsia-derived OmpB or whole-cell antigen for the diagnosis of R. typhi infection</scope></scope> .</sentence>
