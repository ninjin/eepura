<sentence id="0">Calcineurin promotes hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha expression by dephosphorylating RACK1 and blocking RACK1 dimerization .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxygen homeostasis represents an essential organizing principle of metazoan evolution and biology .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) is a master regulator of transcriptional responses to changes in O2 concentration .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">HIF-1 is a heterodimer of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">O2-dependent degradation of the HIF-1alpha subunit is mediated by prolyl hydroxylase , von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL)/Elongin-C E3 ubiquitin ligase , and the proteasome .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">O2-independent degradation of HIF-1alpha is regulated by the competition of RACK1 and HSP90 for binding to HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RACK1 binding results in the recruitment of the Elongin-C E3 ubiquitin ligase , leading to VHL-independent ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In this report , we show that calcineurin inhibits the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Calcineurin is a serine/threonine phosphatase that is activated by calcium and calmodulin .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The phosphatase activity of calcineurin is required for its regulation of HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">RACK1 binds to the catalytic domain of calcineurin and is required for HIF-1alpha degradation induced by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A. Elongin-C and HIF-1alpha each bind to RACK1 and dimerization of RACK1 is required to recruit Elongin-C to HIF-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Phosphorylation of RACK1 promotes its dimerization and dephosphorylation by calcineurin inhibits dimerization .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Serine 146 within the dimerization domain is phosphorylated and mutation of serine 146 impairs RACK1 dimerization and HIF-1alpha degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">These results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> intracellular calcium levels can regulate HIF-1alpha expression by modulating calcineurin activity and RACK1 dimerization</scope> .</sentence>
