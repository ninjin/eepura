<sentence id="0">Genomic hypomethylation and far-5 ' sequence alterations are associated with carcinogen-induced activation of the hamster thymidine kinase gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have investigated the mechanism of activation of an inactive but functionally intact hamster thymidine kinase ( TK ) gene by the chemical carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Following carcinogen treatment of TK- RJK92 Chinese hamster cells , aminopterin-resistant ( HATr ) colonies appeared at a frequency 50-fold higher than in untreated controls .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">More than 80 % of these HATr variants expressed TK enzymatic activity and were divided into high- and low-activity classes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In all TK+ variants , TK expression was correlated with demethylation in the 5' region of the TK gene and the appearance a 1,400-nucleotide TK mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using high-performance liquid chromatography to measure the level of genomic methylation , we found that four of five high-activity lines demonstrated extensive genomic hypomethylation ( approximately 25 % of normal level ) that was associated with demethylation of all TK gene copies .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Restriction endonuclease analysis of 15 low-activity lines revealed four instances of sequence alterations in the far-5 ' region of the TK gene and one instance of a tandem low-copy amplification .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In these lines , the structurally altered gene copy was demethylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Thus , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> that a chemical carcinogen can activate TK expression by several different mechanisms</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Focal demethylation with or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> gene rearrangement</scope> was associated with low TK activity , whereas demethylation throughout the genome was associated with high TK activity .</sentence>
