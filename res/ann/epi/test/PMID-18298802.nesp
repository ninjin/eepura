<sentence id="0">E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP-mediated TSC2 turnover in the presence and absence of HPV16 E6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We previously found that HPV16 E6 causes the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein TSC2 , resulting in the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 even in the <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">absence</cue> of insulin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we investigated the role of E6-associated protein ( E6AP ) in HPV16 E6-induced TSC2 degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Our results demonstrated that TSC2 was targeted for degradation in the presence or <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of HPV16 E6</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Over-expression of E6AP enhanced the degradation of TSC2 by HPV16 E6 , while expression of a dominant negative E6AP ( C833A ) inhibited the E6-induced degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Additionally , by using shRNAs to block E6AP expression in HPV16 positive and negative cells , we found a significantly prolonged TSC2 half-life .</sentence>
