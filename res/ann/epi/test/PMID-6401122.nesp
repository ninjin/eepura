<sentence id="0">Structural aspects of hydroxyproline-containing proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The occurrence of hydroxyproline ( Hyp ) in collagen , C1q and acetylcholineesterase ( AChE ) raises important questions concerning the role of this unusual imino acid in the structure and function of these proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Available data on collagen <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> Hyp is necessary for the normal secretion of the protein after its synthesis and for the integrity of the triple-helical conformation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Studies from our laboratory have dealt with the structural aspects of the posttranslational conversion of proline to hydroxyproline in collagen mediated by prolyl hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">proposed</cue> that the beta-turn conformation at the Pro-Gly segments in the nascent procollagen molecule are the sites of the enzymatic hydroxylation and that this conformation changes over to the collagen-like helix as a result of the hydroxylation process</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Recently , we have provided additional experimental support to our <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">proposal</cue> by a ) synthesizing specific beta-turn oligopeptides containing the Pro-Gly as well as Pro-Ala and Pro-DAla sequences and showing that these act as inhibitors of the enzymatic hydroxylation of a synthetic substrate and b ) demonstrating , by circular dichroism spectroscopy , the occurrence of a conformational change leading to the triple-helix as a direct consequence of proline hydroxylation in a non-helical polypeptide substrate</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We have also observed that the acquisition of hydroxylation results in a significant enhancement of the rate of folding of the polypeptide chain from the unfolded to the triple-helical conformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">believe</cue> that our observations on proline hydroxylation in collagen <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">should</cue> also be applicable to C1q and acetylcholineesterase both of which share the general structural and functional properties of collagen in their " tail " regions</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Using the techniques employed in collagen studies , one <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">should</cue> be able to assess the role of hydroxyproline in the folding , structural stabilities and functions of C1q and AChE</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">would</cue> also involve the study of the unhydroxylated and hydroxylated precursors of these proteins which <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> share common structural features with their collagen counterparts</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Finally , a systematic study of hydroxyproline-containing peptides and polypeptides has been initiated by us so as to understand the exact manner in which Hyp participates in the formation and stability of the triple-helical conformation in the proteins in which it occurs .</sentence>
