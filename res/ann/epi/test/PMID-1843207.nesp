<sentence id="0">Evidence against posttranslational glycosylation of rat glucocorticoid receptors .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The observed M(r) of the rat glucocorticoid receptor on denaturing polyacrylamide gels is 7-11 kDa higher than that deduced from the cloned cDNA sequence of the receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Posttranslational modification of the receptor , such as glycosylation , could account for this difference in mol wt .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Indeed , several reports have appeared in the literature <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that glucocorticoid receptors contain sugar moieties</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We have used a variety of methods to determine <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the receptor is glycosylated , i.e. , digestion of affinity labeled receptors with various glycosidases , immunoadsorption of receptors after whole cell labeling with [3H]D-glucosamine , and ion exchange and lectin column chromatography of affinity labeled receptors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">With each of these methods , there was <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> evidence for glycosylation of the receptor protein</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We therefore conclude that there is <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> significant amount of either N-linked glycosylation</scope> , or O-linked glycosylation with D-glucosamine , of the rat glucocorticoid receptor .</sentence>
