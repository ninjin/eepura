<sentence id="0">The IRAK-catalysed activation of the E3 ligase function of Pellino isoforms induces the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The protein kinases IRAK [ IL-1 ( interleukin 1 ) receptor-associated kinase ] 1 and 4 play key roles in a signalling pathway by which bacterial infection or IL-1 trigger the production of inflammatory mediators .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we demonstrate that IRAK1 and IRAK4 phosphorylate Pellino isoforms in vitro and that phosphorylation greatly enhances Pellino 's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We show that , in vitro , Pellino 1 can combine with the E2 conjugating complex Ubc13 ( ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 ) -Uev1a ( ubiquitin E2 variant 1a ) to catalyse the formation of K63-pUb ( Lys63-linked polyubiquitin ) chains , with UbcH3 to catalyse the formation of K48-pUb chains and with UbcH4 , UbcH5a or UbcH5b to catalyse the formation of pUb-chains linked mainly via Lys11 and Lys48 of ubiquitin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In IRAK1-/- cells , the co-transfection of DNA encoding wild-type IRAK1 and Pellino 2 , but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> inactive mutants of these proteins</scope> , induces the formation of K63-pUb-IRAK1 and its interaction with the NEMO [ NF-kappaB ( nuclear factor kappaB ) essential modifier ] regulatory subunit of the IKK ( inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase ) complex , a K63-pUb-binding protein .</sentence>
