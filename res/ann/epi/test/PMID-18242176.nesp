<sentence id="1">The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The tumor suppressor p53 is an important transcription factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The mutation of the p53 gene is the frequent alteration in most of tumors , but nearly 100 % wild-type p53 gene is found in NPC biopsy .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , our study testified that SV40 T-antigen transformed nasopharyngeal epithelial cells contained free , wild-type p53 .</sentence>
