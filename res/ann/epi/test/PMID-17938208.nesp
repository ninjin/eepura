<sentence id="0">CHD8 associates with human Staf and contributes to efficient U6 RNA polymerase III transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Chromatin remodeling and histone modification are essential for eukaryotic transcription regulation , but little is known about chromatin-modifying activities acting on RNA polymerase III ( Pol III ) -transcribed genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The human U6 small nuclear RNA promoter , located 5' of the transcription start site , consists of a core region directing basal transcription and an activating region that recruits the transcription factors Oct-1 and Staf ( ZNF143 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Oct-1 activates transcription in part by helping recruit core binding factors , but nothing is known about the mechanisms of transcription activation by Staf .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that Staf activates U6 transcription from a preassembled chromatin template in vitro and associates with several proteins linked to chromatin modification , among them chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 8 ( CHD8 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">CHD8 binds to histone H3 di- and trimethylated on lysine 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It resides on the human U6 promoter as well as the mRNA IRF3 promoter in vivo and contributes to efficient transcription from both these promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , Pol III transcription from type 3 promoters uses some of the same factors used for chromatin remodeling at Pol II promoters .</sentence>
