<sentence id="0">Dephosphorylation of p53 at Ser20 after cellular exposure to low levels of non-ionizing radiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Induction of the transactivation function of p53 after cellular irradiation was studied under conditions in which upstream signaling events modulating p53 activation were uncoupled from those regulating stabilization .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This investigation prompted the discovery of a novel radiation-responsive kinase pathway targeting Ser20 that results in the masking of the DO-1 epitope in undamaged cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Unmasking of the DO-1 epitope via dephosphorylation occurs in response to low doses of non-ionizing radiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our data show that phosphorylation at Ser20 reduces binding of the mdm2 protein , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that a function of the Ser20-kinase pathway <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be to produce a stable pool of inactive p53 in undamaged cells which can be readily activated after cellular injury</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to determine <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> the Ser20 signaling pathway is coupled to the Ser15 and Ser392 radiation-responsive kinase pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results demonstrated that : ( 1 ) dephosphorylation at Ser20 is co-ordinated with an increased steady-state phosphorylation at Ser392 after irradiation , without p53 protein stabilization , and ( 2 ) stabilization of p53 protein can occur without Ser15 phosphorylation at higher doses of radiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data show that the Ser20 and Ser392 phosphorylation sites are both targeted by an integrated network of signaling pathways which is acutely sensitive to radiation injury .</sentence>
