N-glycosylation site occupancy of rat alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase IV and the effect of glycosylation on enzymatic activity. 
All mammalian alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases (Fuc-Ts) so far characterized have potential N-glycosylation sites, but the role of these sites in enzymatic activity or localization has not been investigated. When one member of this family, rFuc-TIV, is expressed in bacteria, the unglycosylated form of rFuc-TIV has no detectable enzymatic activity. The two potential N-glycosylation sites of rFuc-TIV were mutated to determine site occupancy and the effect of site occupancy on enzyme activity and targeting of this enzyme. Results obtained with singly mutated forms of rFuc-TIV indicate that both sites are occupied in mammalian cells. Lack of glycosylation at sites 117-119, 218-220, or both of these sites, decreased enzyme activity to approximately 64%, 5% or 1%, respectively, of that seen in the unmutated enzyme. These results show that N-glycosylation is necessary for optimal enzyme activity, with glycosylation at site 218-220 playing the major role. However, N-glycosylation does not appear to affect the major intracellular location of the enzyme, as immunocytochemistry reveals the same perinuclear pattern of staining for the unglycosylated mutants as is seen for the wild-type rFuc-TIV in transfected cells.
