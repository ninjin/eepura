<sentence id="0">The crystal structure of xanthine oxidoreductase during catalysis : implications for reaction mechanism and enzyme inhibition .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Molybdenum is widely distributed in biology and is usually found as a mononuclear metal center in the active sites of many enzymes catalyzing oxygen atom transfer .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The molybdenum hydroxylases are distinct from other biological systems catalyzing hydroxylation reactions in that the oxygen atom incorporated into the product is derived from water <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">rather than</cue> molecular oxygen</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we present the crystal structure of the key intermediate in the hydroxylation reaction of xanthine oxidoreductase with a slow substrate , in which the carbon-oxygen bond of the product is formed , yet the product remains complexed to the molybdenum .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This intermediate displays a stable broad charge-transfer band at approximately 640 nm .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The crystal structure of the complex <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicates that</cue> the catalytically labile Mo-OH oxygen has formed a bond with a carbon atom of the substrate</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , the MoS group of the oxidized enzyme has become protonated to afford Mo-SH on reduction of the molybdenum center .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In contrast to previous assignments , we find this last ligand at an equatorial position in the square-pyramidal metal coordination sphere , not the apical position .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">A water molecule usually seen in the active site of the enzyme is <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">absent</cue> in the present structure , which <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">probably</cue> accounts for the stability of this intermediate toward ligand displacement by hydroxide</scope></scope> .</sentence>
