<sentence id="0">Fluorescent reporters of the histone acetyltransferase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) are important chromatin modifying enzymes that catalyze acetylation of specific lysine residues in histone and nonhistone substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">They participate in multiple cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation and signal transduction .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Aberrant expression of HATs has been observed in various disease states , especially cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , current strategies used for studying HAT enzymatic activity and inhibitor discovery are quite limited .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We report here a novel strategy for the homogeneous , continuous , one-step measurement of HAT activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A series of fluorescent reporters based on the amino-terminal seqence of histone H4 were synthesized and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">evaluated for</cue> HAT assay</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Fluorescence signals change effectively in response to the acetylation process by HAT p300 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Such an assay <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">should</cue> thus be broadly useful for assaying HAT activity in vitro as well as valuable in discovering new anticancer drugs based on the modulation of the HAT targets</scope> .</sentence>
