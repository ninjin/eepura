<sentence id="0">The role of N-glycosylation in the targeting and activity of the GLYT1 glycine transporter .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">To elucidate the role of N-glycosylation in the function of the high affinity glycine transporter GLYT1 , we have investigated the effect of the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin as well as the effect of the disruption of the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> glycosylation sites</scope> by site-directed mutagenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins from GLYT1-transfected COS cells reveals a major band of 80-100 kDa and a minor one of 57 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Treatment with tunicamycin produces a 40 % inhibition in transport activity and a decrease in the intensity of the 80-100-kDa band , whereas the 57-kDa band decreases in size to yield a 47-kDa protein corresponding to the unglycosylated form of the transporter .</sentence>
