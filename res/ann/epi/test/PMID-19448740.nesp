<sentence id="0">Cj1123c ( PglD ) , a multifaceted acetyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Campylobacter jejuni produces both N- and O-glycosylated proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Because protein glycosylation contributes to bacterial virulence , a thorough characterization of the enzymes involved in protein glycosylation is warranted to assess their <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> use as therapeutic targets and as glyco-engineering tools</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We performed a detailed biochemical analysis of the molecular determinants of the substrate and acyl-donor specificities of Cj1123c ( also known as PglD ) , an acetyltransferase of the HexAT superfamily involved in N-glycosylation of proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that Cj1123c has acetyl-CoA-dependent N-acetyltransferase activity <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> only on the UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-GlcNAc intermediate of the N-glycosylation pathway but also on the UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-AltNAc intermediate of the O-glycosylation pathway</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">implying</cue> functional redundancy between both pathways</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We further demonstrate that , despite its somewhat relaxed substrate specificity for N-acetylation , Cj1123c cannot acetylate aminoglycosides , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicating</cue> a preference for sugar-nucleotide substrates</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , we show that Cj1123c can O-acetylate UDP-GlcNAc and that Cj1123c is very versatile in terms of acyl-CoA donors as it can use propionyl- and butyryl-CoA <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">instead of</cue> acetyl-CoA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , using structural information available for Cj1123c and related enzymes , we identify three residues ( H125 , G143 , and G173 ) involved in catalysis and ( or ) acyl-donor specificity , opening up possibilities of tailoring the specificity of Cj1123c for the synthesis of novel sugars .</sentence>
