<sentence id="0">Critical DNA binding interactions of the insulator protein CTCF : a small number of zinc fingers mediate strong binding , and a single finger-DNA interaction controls binding at imprinted loci .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The DNA-binding protein CTCF ( CCCTC binding factor ) mediates enhancer blocking insulation at sites throughout the genome and plays an important role in regulating allele-specific expression at the Igf2/H19 locus and at other imprinted loci .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Evidence is also accumulating that CTCF is involved in large scale organization of genomic chromatin .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although CTCF has 11 zinc fingers , we show here that only 4 of these are essential to strong binding and that they recognize a core 12-bp DNA sequence common to most CTCF sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">By deleting individual fingers and mutating individual sites , we determined the orientation of binding .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , we were able to identify the specific finger and its point of DNA interaction that are responsible for the loss of CTCF binding when CpG residues are methylated in the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="spec" id="0"> This single interaction <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be critical for allele-specific binding and insulation by CTCF</scope> .</sentence>
