Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers and dimers show identical decreases in Km values for peptide substrates with increasing chain length: mutation of one of the two catalytic sites in the tetramer inactivates the enzyme by more than half. 
The collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (collagen P4Hs, EC 1.14.11.2) play a key role in the synthesis of the extracellular matrix. The vertebrate enzymes are alpha(2)beta(2) tetramers, the beta subunit being identical to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The main Caenorhabditis elegans collagen P4H form is an unusual PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI)(2) mixed tetramer consisting of two types of catalytic alpha subunit, but the PHY-1 and PHY-2 polypeptides also form active PHY/PDI dimers. The lengths of peptide substrates have a major effect on their interaction with the P4H tetramers, the K(m) values decreasing markedly with increasing chain length. This phenomenon has been explained in terms of processive binding of the two catalytic subunits to long peptides. We determined here the K(m) values of a collagen P4H having two catalytic sites, the C. elegans mixed tetramer, and a form having only one such site, the PHY-1/PDI dimer, for peptides of varying lengths. All the K(m) values of the PHY-1/PDI dimer were found to be about 1.5-2.5 times those of the tetramer, but increasing peptide length led to identical decreases in the values of both enzyme forms. The K(m) for a nonhydroxylated collagen fragment with 33 -X-Y-Gly-triplets but only 11 -X-Pro-Gly-triplets was found to correspond to the number of the former rather than the latter. To study the individual roles of the two catalytic sites in a tetramer, we produced mutant PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI)(2) tetramers in which binding of the Fe(2+) ion or 2-oxoglutarate to one of the two catalytic sites was prevented. The activities of the mutant tetramers decreased to markedly less than 50% of that of the wild type, being about 5-10% and 20-30% with the enzymes having one of the two Fe(2+)-binding sites or 2-oxoglutarate-binding sites inactivated, respectively, while the K(m) values for these cosubstrates or peptide substrates were not affected. Our data thus indicate that although collagen P4Hs do not act on peptide substrates by a processive mechanism, prevention of hydroxylation at one of the two catalytic sites in the tetramer impairs the function of the other catalytic site.
