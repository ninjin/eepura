<sentence id="0">Isoniazid acetylating phenotype in patients with paracoccidioidomycosis and its relationship with serum sulfadoxin levels , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase activities .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The authors evaluated the isoniazid acetylating phenotype and measured hematocrit , hemoglobin , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase activities plus serum sulfadoxin levels in 39 patients with paracoccidioidomycosis ( 33 males and 6 females ) aged 17 to 58 years .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Twenty one ( 53.84 % ) of the patients presented a slow acetylating phenotype and 18(46.16 % ) a fast acetylating phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) activity was decreased in 5(23.80 % ) slow acetylators and in 4(22.22 % ) fast acetylators .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Glutathione reductase activity was decreased in 14(66.66 % ) slow acetylators and in 12(66.66 % ) fast acetylators .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Serum levels of free and total sulfadoxin were higher in slow acetylator ( p less than 0.02 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Analysis of the results permitted us to conclude that serum sulfadoxin levels are related to the acetylator phenotype .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , sulfadoxin levels were always above 50 micrograms/ml , a value considered therapeutic .</sentence>
