Underhydroxylated minor cartilage collagen precursors cannot form stable triple helices. 
Matrix-free cells from chick-embryo sterna were incubated with various concentrations of 2,2'-bipyridyl, an iron chelator that inhibits prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. At concentrations in the region of 0.1 mM, significant effects on cartilage collagen hydroxylation and secretion were observed. When the underhydroxylated collagens were subsequently digested with chymotrypsin or chymotrypsin plus trypsin at 4 degrees C for 15 min, the minor cartilage collagen precursors (namely types IX and XI) were extensively degraded; type II procollagen was only partially susceptible and was converted into underhydroxylated collagen. The results demonstrate that there were significant differences in triple-helix stability among cartilage collagens such that the underhydroxylated minor collagen precursors were unable to attain a native structure under conditions where type II procollagen was successful.
