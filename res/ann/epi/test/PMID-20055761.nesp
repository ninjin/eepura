<sentence id="0">Investigating the dependence of the hypoxia-inducible factor hydroxylases ( factor inhibiting HIF and prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 ) on ascorbate and other reducing agents .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The HIF ( hypoxia-inducible factor ) hydroxylases [ PHDs or EGLNs ( prolyl hydroxylases ) , which in humans are PHD isoforms 1-3 , and FIH ( factor inhibiting HIF ) ] regulate HIF levels and activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These enzymes are Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases , many of which are stimulated by ascorbate .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have investigated the ascorbate dependence of PHD2-catalysed hydroxylation of two prolyl hydroxylation sites in human HIF-1alpha , and of FIH-catalysed hydroxylation of asparaginyl hydroxylation sites in HIF-1alpha and in a consensus ankyrin repeat domain peptide .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The initial rate and extent of hydroxylation was increased in the presence of ascorbate for each of these reactions .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When ascorbate was replaced with structural analogues , the results revealed that the ascorbate side chain was <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> important in its contribution to HIF hydroxylase catalysis</scope> , whereas modifications to the ene-diol portion of the molecule negated the ability to promote hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> <scope type="spec" id="2"> alternative reducing agents ( glutathione and dithiothreitol ) <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> be used to promote HIF hydroxylase activity , and found partial stimulation of hydroxylation in an apparently enzyme- and substrate-specific manner</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The results raise the possibility of developing reducing agents targeted to specific HIF hydroxylase-catalysed reactions .</sentence>
