<sentence id="0">Histone modification in constitutive heterochromatin versus unexpressed euchromatin in human cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone modifications are implicated in regulating chromatin condensation but it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue> how they differ between constitutive heterochromatin and unexpressed euchromatin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays were done on various human cell populations using antibodies specific for acetylated or methylated forms of histone H3 or H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis of the immunoprecipitates was by quantitative real-time PCR or semi-quantitative PCR ( SQ-PCR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Of eight tested antibodies , the one for histone H4 acetylated at lysine 4 , 8 , 12 , or 16 was best for distinguishing constitutive heterochromatin from unexpressed euchromatin , but differences in the extent of immunoprecipitation of these two types of chromatin were only modest , although highly reproducible .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">With this antibody , there was an average of 2.5-fold less immunoprecipitation of three constitutive heterochromatin regions than of four unexpressed euchromatic gene regions and about 15-fold less immunoprecipitation of these heterochromatin standards than of two constitutively expressed gene standards ( P < 0.001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also analyzed histone acetylation and methylation by immunocytochemistry with antibodies to H4 acetylated at lysine 8 , H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 , and H3 methylated at lysine 4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , immunocytochemical analysis was done with an antibody to heterochromatin protein 1alpha ( HP1alpha ) , whose preferential binding to heterochromatin has been linked to trimethylation of H3 at lysine 9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Our combined ChIP and immunocytochemical results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that factors other than hypoacetylation of the N-terminal tails of H4 and hypermethylation of H3 at lysine 9 can play an important role in determining <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> a chromatin sequence in mammalian cells is constitutively heterochromatic</scope></scope> .</sentence>
