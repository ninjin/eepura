<sentence id="0">A novel approach for N-glycosylation studies using detergent extracted microsomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recently , it has become apparent that asparagine-linked ( N-linked ) oligosaccharide at an early stage of processing can play an important role in quality control of the secretory pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we have developed a system for better understanding of the N-glycosylation machinery and its involvement in quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Rough microsomes ( RM ) treated with 0.18 % Tx-100 ( TxRM ) preserved translocation activities to a similar extent detected in RM .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TxRM were depleted of many soluble proteins including glucosidase II , BiP and Erp72 , but maintained approximately 80 % of calnexin , a membrane protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">More importantly , TxRM revealed insufficient glycosylation of T cell receptor-alpha ( TCR-alpha ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that a factor <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">or</cue> factors</scope> extracted with 0.18 % Tx-100 is responsible for facilitating the transfer of oligosaccharides to the protein</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In addition , the top band of TCR-alpha translated in TxRM migrated slower than that in RM , but faster than that in RM treated with castanospermine ( CST ) , an inhibitor of glucosidase I/II .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggests</cue> that the trimming of the inner two glucose sugars is impaired by the loss of glucosidase II</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Furthermore , we demonstrated that TCR-alpha coprecipitated with calnexin migrated between unglucosylated and diglucosylated forms on SDS-PAGE .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Thus , the treatment of RM with low concentration of detergent is a very powerful method for elucidating not only N-glycosylation processes but also other biological functions such as quality control in the ER .</sentence>
