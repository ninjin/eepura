<sentence id="0">Inhibitors of 2-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases block aspartyl beta-hydroxylation of recombinant human factor IX in several mammalian expression systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">While a role has been ascribed to the gamma-carboxyglutamate ( Gla ) residues in vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins and the enzyme catalyzing this posttranslational modification has been identified and partially characterized , both the functional significance of a second posttranslationally synthesized amino acid found in these proteins , beta-hydroxyaspartate ( Hya ) , and the aspartyl beta-hydroxylating enzyme remain to be determined .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We now report that inhibitors of 2-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases , such as dipyridyl , o-phenanthroline , and pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate , block hydroxylation of Asp64 in recombinant factor IX molecules produced in three different mammalian expression systems .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="neg" id="0">This hydroxylation was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> inhibited by the specific copper chelators 2,9-dimethylphenanthroline or D-penicillamine</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The Gla levels in these proteins were unaffected by these compounds and demonstrate that carboxylation proceeds independently of hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using these Hya-deficient recombinant factor IX molecules we demonstrate that this residue does <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> play a significant role in factor IX binding to endothelial cells under equilibrium conditions</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">From additional binding studies we have concluded that the Gla domain of factor IX is a major cell binding domain of factor IX .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , in contrast to studies demonstrating a marked loss of one-stage clotting activity in recombinant factors IX following site-directed mutations of Asp64 to neutral or basic residues ( Rees , D. J. G. , Jones , I. M. , Handford , P. A. , Walter , S. J. , Esnouf , M. P. , Smith , K. J. , and Brownlee , G. J. ( 1988 ) EMBO J. 7 , 2053-2061 ) , we have <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> found a decrease of one-stage clotting activity with Hya-deficient factor IX</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Hya-deficient proteins produced in this manner <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> prove to be more appropriate to elucidate the function of Hya than those produced by site-directed mutagenesis</scope> .</sentence>
