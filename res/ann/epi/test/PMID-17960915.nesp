<sentence id="0">Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 : positively charged residues in substrate peptides distal to the site of methylation are important for substrate binding and catalysis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein arginine methyltransferases ( PRMTs ) are a group of eukaryotic enzymes that catalyze the methylation of Arg residues in a variety of proteins ( e.g. , histones H3 and H4 ) , and their activities influence a wide range of cellular processes , including cell growth , RNA splicing , differentiation , and transcriptional regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Dysregulation of these enzymes has been linked to heart disease and cancer , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> this enzyme family as a novel therapeutic target</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">To aid the development of PRMT inhibitors , we characterized the substrate specificity of both the rat and human PRMT1 orthologues using histone based peptide substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">N- and C-terminal truncations to identify a minimal peptide substrate <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> long-range interactions between enzyme and substrate are important for high rates of substrate capture</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The importance of these long-range interactions to substrate capture were confirmed by " mutagenesis " experiments on a minimal peptide substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inhibition studies on S-adenosyl-homocysteine , thioadenosine , methylthioadenosine , homocysteine , and sinefungin <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that potent and selective bisubstrate analogue inhibitor(s) for PRMT1 can be developed by linking a histone based peptide substrate to homocysteine or sinefungin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Additionally , we present evidence that PRMT1 utilizes a partially processive mechanism to dimethylate its substrates .</sentence>
