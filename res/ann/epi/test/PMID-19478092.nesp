<sentence id="0">Occludin phosphorylation and ubiquitination regulate tight junction trafficking and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced permeability .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) alters tight junctions ( TJs ) and promotes vascular permeability in many retinal and brain diseases .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the molecular mechanisms of barrier regulation are poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we demonstrate that occludin phosphorylation and ubiquitination regulate VEGF-induced TJ protein trafficking and concomitant vascular permeability .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">VEGF treatment induced TJ fragmentation and occludin trafficking from the cell border to early and late endosomes , concomitant with increased occludin phosphorylation on Ser-490 and ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Furthermore , both co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that VEGF treatment increased the interaction between occludin and modulators of intracellular trafficking that contain the ubiquitin interacting motif , including Epsin-1 , epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 ( Eps15 ) , and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( Hrs ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Inhibiting occludin phosphorylation by mutating Ser-490 to Ala suppressed VEGF-induced ubiquitination , inhibited trafficking of TJ proteins , and prevented the increase in endothelial permeability .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , an occludin-ubiquitin chimera disrupted TJs and increased permeability without VEGF .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of VEGF-induced occludin phosphorylation and ubiquitination that contributes to TJ trafficking and subsequent vascular permeability .</sentence>
