<sentence id="2">Structural similarities and frequent co-occurrence <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the biosynthetic pathways for these compounds share common features</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Based on available literature data we <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">propose</cue> that oximes produced by CYP79 orthologs are common intermediates and that their conversion into beta- and gamma-hydroxynitrile glucosides is mediated by evolutionary diversified multifunctional orthologs to CYP71E1</scope> .</sentence>
