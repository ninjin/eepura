Frog prodermorphin expressed in mammalian cells is partly converted to the hydroxyproline containing precursor. 
Using recombinant vaccinia virus, we have expressed in mammalian cells the cDNA coding for the precursor of dermorphin, a D-alanine containing opioid peptide from the skin of the South American frog Phyllomedusa sauvagei. HeLa cells and AtT-20 cells produced prodermorphin where proline-6 of dermorphin was partly hydroxylated. This was demonstrated by digesting the partially purified precursors with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B. After immunoprecipitation and separation by HPLC, two decapeptides were detected which differed by the presence of proline or hydroxy-proline at position 6. This demonstrates that HeLa cells as well as AtT-20 cells can perform the post-translational conversion of certain proline residues to hydroxyproline in a foreign hormone precursor expressed in these cells.
