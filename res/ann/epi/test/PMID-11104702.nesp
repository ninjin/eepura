<sentence id="0">Coexpression of alpha and beta subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase stabilizes the triple helix of recombinant human type X collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have reported previously on the expression of recombinant human type X collagen ( hrColX ) in HEK 293 and HT 1080 cells by using the eukaryotic expression vector pCMVsis ( in which CMV stands for cytomegalovirus ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Several stably transfected clones secreted full-length triple-helical hrColX molecules in large amounts , but the secreted collagen was underhydroxylated , with a hydroxyproline-to-proline ratio of 0.25 and a melting temperature ( T(m) ) of 31 degrees C. By comparison , native chicken type X procollagen has a T(m) of 46 degrees C. To stabilize the triple helix of hrColX , an hrColX-expressing clone ( A6/16 ) was co-transfected with both alpha and beta subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Clones were selected that secreted proalpha1(X) collagen chains with an <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">apparent</cue> molecular mass of 75 kDa</scope> and an increased hydroxyproline-to-proline ratio of close to 0.5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">As a result of enhanced prolyl hydroxylation , the T(m) of the hrColX was increased to 41 degrees C as measured by CD analysis at various temperatures .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The CD spectra <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated</cue> a minimum ellipticity at 198 nm and a peak at 225 nm at 20 degrees C , confirming the presence of a triple helix</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The same T(m) of 41 degrees C was measured for the triple-helical core fragments of hrColX of 60-65 kDa that were retained after brief digestion with chymotrypsin/trypsin at increasing temperatures .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This shows that the human cell line HEK-293 is suitable for the simultaneous expression of three genes and the stable production of substantial amounts of recombinant , fully hydroxylated type X collagen over several years .</sentence>
