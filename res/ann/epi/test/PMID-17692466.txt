Induction of histone acetylation on the CRBPII gene in perinatal rat small intestine. 
The expression of genes associated with lipid and vitamin A metabolism is elevated when the small intestinal mucosa is maturing rapidly during the perinatal period. We have previously reported that cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII) mRNA levels rise abruptly in the rat small intestine during this period. In this study, we examined whether the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is involved in the intestinal expression of CRBPII during the perinatal stage. The expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 genes, which are markers of cell proliferation, decreased markedly during the perinatal period, whereas expression of CRBPII as well as villin, a marker of intestinal maturation, increased rapidly. Using a ChIP assay, we showed rapid induction of acetylation of the histones H3 and H4 which interacted with the promoter/enhancer region of the CRBPII gene at this time. The binding of CBP and p300, which have histone acetyltransferase activity, as well as binding of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) increased on the CRBPII promoter/enhancer region during the perinatal period. These results suggest that CRBPII gene expression during the perinatal period is associated with abrupt acetylation of histones H3 and H4 followed by the binding of CBP/p300 and RXRalpha.
