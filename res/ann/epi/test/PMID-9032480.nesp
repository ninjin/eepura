<sentence id="0">Biochemical analysis of a bladder-cancer-associated mucin : structural features and epitope characterization .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Three monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) , M344 , M300 and M75 , were shown to define a unique tumour-associated antigen ( TAA ) of superficial bladder tumours .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The antigenic determinants are expressed on a very-high-molecular-mass component and , in about 50 % of the positive samples , one determinant is also detected on a 62 kDa molecular species , observed only under reducing conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The objectives of the present study were to characterize further this TAA by analysing ( 1 ) the biochemical nature of the epitopes recognized by the three mAbs , and ( 2 ) the biochemical and structural features of the molecule bearing them .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The antigenicity was resistant to heat denaturation , trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin treatments but highly sensitive to papain and Pronase digestion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NaIO4 oxidation decreased reactivity to mAbs M344 and M300 but enhanced reactivity to mAb M75 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The three determinants were insensitive to beta-galactosidase and alpha-L-fucosidase but were sensitive to Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">None of the three mAbs reacted with ovine , bovine or porcine submaxillary mucins .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Deglycosylation with O-glycosidase or trifluoromethanesulphonic acid completely abolished the reactivity of the mAbs whereas N-glycosidase F deglycosylation had <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> appreciable effect</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The presence on the molecule of cryptic Gal(beta(1-3))GalNAc as a major core disaccharide was demonstrated by a heterologous sandwich assay using mAb M75 and peanut agglutinin .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Thiol reduction using beta-mercaptoethanol increased mobility of the high-molecular-mass component in polyacrylamide gels .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We thus conclude that mAbs M344 and M300 react with sialylated carbohydrate epitopes , and mAb M75 reacts with a partially cryptic and periodate-resistant sialylated epitope expressed on a typical secreted high-molecular-mass oligomeric mucin which we named MAUB for mucin antigen of the urinary bladder .</sentence>
