<sentence id="0">Chromatin assembly : biochemical identities and genetic redundancy .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Investigations on chromatin assembly in vitro implicate chromatin assembly factor 1 ( CAF1 ) as a chaperone for histones H3/H4 and nucleosome assembly protein 1 ( NAP1 ) as a chaperone for histones H2A/H2B .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Deletion analysis of CAF1 in vivo <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggests</cue> multiple redundant pathways for deposition of the histones</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Histone deposition requires acetylation of the amino-terminal tails and analysis of mutants <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> a specific but redundant role for acetylation of the tails in assembly</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , studies on the HAT1 acetyltransferase raise the possibility that acetylation of histones occurs following their transport into the nucleus but prior to their deposition onto DNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Identification of the factors involved in the redundant pathways of assembly is awaited .</sentence>
