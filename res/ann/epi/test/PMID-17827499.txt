Critical DNA binding interactions of the insulator protein CTCF: a small number of zinc fingers mediate strong binding, and a single finger-DNA interaction controls binding at imprinted loci. 
The DNA-binding protein CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) mediates enhancer blocking insulation at sites throughout the genome and plays an important role in regulating allele-specific expression at the Igf2/H19 locus and at other imprinted loci. Evidence is also accumulating that CTCF is involved in large scale organization of genomic chromatin. Although CTCF has 11 zinc fingers, we show here that only 4 of these are essential to strong binding and that they recognize a core 12-bp DNA sequence common to most CTCF sites. By deleting individual fingers and mutating individual sites, we determined the orientation of binding. Furthermore, we were able to identify the specific finger and its point of DNA interaction that are responsible for the loss of CTCF binding when CpG residues are methylated in the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus. This single interaction appears to be critical for allele-specific binding and insulation by CTCF.
