<sentence id="0">N-glycosylation site occupancy of rat alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase IV and the effect of glycosylation on enzymatic activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">All mammalian alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases ( Fuc-Ts ) so far characterized have <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> N-glycosylation sites</scope> , but <scope type="neg" id="0">the role of these sites in enzymatic activity or localization has <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> been investigated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">When one member of this family , rFuc-TIV , is expressed in bacteria , the unglycosylated form of rFuc-TIV has <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> detectable enzymatic activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The two <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">potential</cue> N-glycosylation sites of rFuc-TIV</scope> were mutated to determine site occupancy and the effect of site occupancy on enzyme activity and targeting of this enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Results obtained with singly mutated forms of rFuc-TIV <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> both sites are occupied in mammalian cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Lack of glycosylation at sites 117-119 , 218-220 , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">or</cue> both of these sites , decreased enzyme activity to approximately 64 % , 5 % or 1 % , respectively , of that seen in the unmutated enzyme</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results show that N-glycosylation is necessary for optimal enzyme activity , with glycosylation at site 218-220 playing the major role .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , <scope type="spec" id="7"> N-glycosylation does <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> <cue type="spec" id="7">appear</cue> to affect the major intracellular location of the enzyme</scope></scope> , as immunocytochemistry reveals the same perinuclear pattern of staining for the unglycosylated mutants as is seen for the wild-type rFuc-TIV in transfected cells .</sentence>
