<sentence id="0">Targeting WW domains linker of HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 for activation by CKIP-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">E3 ubiquitin ligases are final effectors of the enzyme cascade controlling ubiquitylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A central issue in understanding their regulation is to decipher mechanisms of their assembly and activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In contrast with RING-type E3s , fewer mechanisms are known for regulation of HECT-type E3s .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor 1 ( Smurf1 ) , a C2-WW-HECT-domain E3 , is crucial for bone homeostasis , in which it suppresses osteoblast activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> and how its activity is regulated remains <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">unclear</scope></cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Here we show that Smurf1 , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> Smurf2</scope> , interacts with casein kinase-2 interacting protein-1 ( CKIP-1 ) , resulting in an increase in its E3 ligase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Surprisingly , CKIP-1 targets specifically the linker region between the WW domains of Smurf1 , thereby augmenting its affinity for and promoting ubiquitylation of the substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Moreover , CKIP-1-deficient mice undergo an age-dependent increase in bone mass as a result of accelerated osteogenesis and decreased Smurf1 activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These findings provide evidence that the WW domains linker is important in complex assembly and in regulating activity of HECT-type E3s and that CKIP-1 functions as the first auxiliary factor to enhance the activation of Smurf1 .</sentence>
