<sentence id="0">Kinetic analysis of human protein arginine N-methyltransferase 2 : formation of monomethyl- and asymmetric dimethyl-arginine residues on histone H4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein arginine N-methyltransferases ( PRMTs ) methylate arginine residues within proteins using S-adenosyl-L-methionine ( AdoMet ) to form S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and methylarginine residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">All PRMTs produce omega-NG-monomethylarginine ( MMA ) residues and either asymmetric omega-N(G) , N(G)-dimethylarginine ( aDMA ) or symmetric omega-N(G) , N'(G)-dimethylarginine ( sDMA ) residues , referred to as Type I or Type II activity respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we report methylation activity from PRMT2 and compare it with PRMT1 activity using UPLC-MS/MS ( ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS ) , gel electrophoresis , and thin-layer chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We show that PRMT2 is a Type I enzyme and that the ratio of aDMA to MMA produced by PRMTs 1 and 2 is dependent on the substrate , regardless of rate or K(m) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the reactions for both enzymes are distributive rather than processive</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using UPLC-MS/MS we find that , for PRMT2 , the dissociation constant ( KAs ) and K(m) of AdoMet and the Km of histone H4 are similar to values for PRMT1 , whereas the PRMT2 k(cat) is 800-fold less than the PRMT1 k(cat) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although PRMT2 activity is substantially lower than PRMT1 in vitro , the fact that both enzymes selectively methylate histone H4 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that PRMT2 , like PRMT1 , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> act as a transcription co-activator through this modification</scope></scope> .</sentence>
