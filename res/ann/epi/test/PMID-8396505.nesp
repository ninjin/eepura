<sentence id="0">Partial characterization of the rH1 sodium channel protein from rat heart using subtype-specific antibodies .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Three subtype-specific antisera were generated against peptides corresponding to portions of the amino terminus , interdomain 1-2 , and carboxy terminus of the rH1 sodium channel primary sequence to confirm the expression of this protein in the adult rat heart and to determine selected biochemical properties of this protein that <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> contribute to its subtype-specific characteristics</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">All three antisera identify a 240-kD band on Western blots of partially purified cardiac membrane proteins and by immunoprecipitation of iodinated partially purified membrane proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Unlike other characterized mammalian sodium channels , no beta subunit is detected in association with the rH1 alpha subunit .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The rH1 alpha subunit is a complex sialoglycoprotein as evidenced by its interaction with wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose and by reduction in its apparent molecular weight after treatment with neuraminidase ; deglycosylation with N-glycanase confirms that the rH1 protein contains significantly less carbohydrate than other sodium channel proteins characterized to date ( 5 % versus 25 % to 30 % ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistent with electrophysiological studies <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating</cue> a role of phosphorylation in channel regulation</scope> , the rH1 alpha subunit can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> functional significance of these findings</scope> is discussed .</sentence>
