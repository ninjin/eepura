<sentence id="0">The TRC8 ubiquitin ligase is sterol regulated and interacts with lipid and protein biosynthetic pathways .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">TRC8/RNF139 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase that inhibits growth in a RING- and ubiquitylation-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">TRC8 also contains a predicted sterol-sensing domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we report that TRC8 protein levels are sterol responsive and that it binds and stimulates ubiquitylation of the endoplasmic reticulum anchor protein INSIG .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Induction of TRC8 destabilized the precursor forms of the transcription factors SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Loss of SREBP precursors was proteasome dependent , required a functional RING domain , occurred without generating processed nuclear forms , and suppressed SREBP target genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">TRC8 knockdown had opposite effects in sterol-deprived cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In Drosophila , growth inhibition by DTrc8 was genetically suppressed by loss of specific Mprlp , Padlp N-terminal domain-containing proteins found in the COP9 signalosome and eIF3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">DTrc8 genetically and physically interacted with two eIF3 subunits : eIF3f and eIF3h .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed these interactions in mammalian cells , and TRC8 overexpression suppressed polysome profiles .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Moreover , high-molecular weight ubiquitylated proteins were observed in eIF3 immunoprecipitations from TRC8-overexpressing cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Thus , TRC8 function <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> provide a regulatory link between the lipid and protein biosynthetic pathways</scope> .</sentence>
