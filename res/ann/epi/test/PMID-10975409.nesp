<sentence id="0">Seminal plasma glycodelin and fertilization in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Endometrium-derived glycodelin-A inhibits sperm-egg binding , whereas differentially glycosylated seminal plasma glycodelin-S does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The difference has been ascribed to the specific type of glycosylation of glycodelin-A .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We studied <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> the total glycodelin concentration or the relative glycodelin-A concentration in seminal plasma are related to the in vitro fertilization rate of oocytes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that total glycodelin levels were significantly higher in a quartile of men with the lowest in vitro fertilization rate compared with the remaining 3 quartiles combined ( P = .01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , for predicting low fertilization capacity of sperm , combining the glycodelin and sperm concentrations by logistic regression analysis did not significantly increase the information obtained from sperm concentration alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">We</cue> used specific lectin-immunoassays to determine <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">whether</cue> <scope type="spec" id="4"> increased glycodelin-A-type glycosylation in seminal plasma <cue type="spec" id="4">would</cue> be related to failure to fertilize</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">No</cue> difference</scope> was found between the groups with high fertilization and <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">no</cue> fertilization in vitro</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">It is concluded that , although high seminal plasma total glycodelin level has a tendency of being associated with a lower fertilization rate , the difference has limited value to predict fertilization in vitro .</sentence>
