Genomic hypomethylation and far-5' sequence alterations are associated with carcinogen-induced activation of the hamster thymidine kinase gene. 
We have investigated the mechanism of activation of an inactive but functionally intact hamster thymidine kinase (TK) gene by the chemical carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Following carcinogen treatment of TK- RJK92 Chinese hamster cells, aminopterin-resistant (HATr) colonies appeared at a frequency 50-fold higher than in untreated controls. More than 80% of these HATr variants expressed TK enzymatic activity and were divided into high- and low-activity classes. In all TK+ variants, TK expression was correlated with demethylation in the 5' region of the TK gene and the appearance a 1,400-nucleotide TK mRNA. Using high-performance liquid chromatography to measure the level of genomic methylation, we found that four of five high-activity lines demonstrated extensive genomic hypomethylation (approximately 25% of normal level) that was associated with demethylation of all TK gene copies. Restriction endonuclease analysis of 15 low-activity lines revealed four instances of sequence alterations in the far-5' region of the TK gene and one instance of a tandem low-copy amplification. In these lines, the structurally altered gene copy was demethylated. Thus, we propose that a chemical carcinogen can activate TK expression by several different mechanisms. Focal demethylation with or without gene rearrangement was associated with low TK activity, whereas demethylation throughout the genome was associated with high TK activity.
