<sentence id="0">A core protein epitope of the polymorphic epithelial mucin detected by the monoclonal antibody SM-3 is selectively exposed in a range of primary carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) SM-3 , which was raised to chemically deglycosylated milk mucin , reacts with an epitope present on the core protein of this mucin which we have referred to as PEM ( polymorphic epithelial mucin ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although this mucin is abundantly expressed by both the lactating breast and breast carcinomas , the antibody SM-3 shows very little or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> reactivity on the former</scope> but does react with 92 % of breast carcinomas .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Furthermore , SM-3 stains primary carcinomas of the lung , colon and ovary , but on the corresponding normal tissue the epitope is expressed at a much reduced level <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">or</cue> <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> at all</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate that</cue> an epitope masked in the normal mucin is exposed in the mucin produced by tumour cells , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">perhaps</cue> due to aberrant glycosylation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">An extensive immunohistochemical study of other normal tissues reveals that the majority show only weak focal staining with SM-3 or none at all , the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney , and sebaceous glands being the only normal tissues studied to show homogeneously positive staining .</sentence>
