<sentence id="0">Characterization of an alpha-L-rhamnosidase from Aspergillus kawachii and its gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">An alpha-L-rhamnosidase was purified by fractionating a culture filtrate of Aspergillus kawachii grown on L-rhamnose as the sole carbon source .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The alpha-L-rhamnosidase had a molecular mass of 90 kDa and a high degree of N-glycosylation of approximately 22 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 4.0 and temperature of 50 degrees C. Further , it was observed to be thermostable , and it retained more than 80 % of its original activity following incubation at 60 degrees C for 1 h. Its T ( 50 ) value was determined to be 72 degrees C. The enzyme was able to hydrolyze alpha-1,2- and alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The specific activity of the enzyme was higher toward naringin than toward hesperidin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The A. kawachii alpha-L-rhamnosidase-encoding gene ( Ak-rhaA ) codes for a 655-amino-acid protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA , the protein possessed 13 <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> N-glycosylation recognition sites</scope> and exhibited a high degree of sequence identity ( up to 75 % ) with the alpha-L-rhamnosidases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 78 from Aspergillus aculeatus and with hypothetical Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus fumigatus proteins .</sentence>
