<sentence id="0">DNA-methyltransferase 1 mRNA is selectively overexpressed in telencephalic GABAergic interneurons of schizophrenia brains .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A down-regulation of reelin and glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD ) 67 mRNAs was detected in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic cortical interneurons of schizophrenia ( SZ ) postmortem brains ( 10 ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the availability of GABA and reelin <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be decreased in SZ cortex</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In situ hybridization of the mRNA encoding for DNA-methyltransferase 1 , which catalyzes the methylation of promoter CpG islands , shows that the expression of this mRNA is increased in cortical GABAergic interneurons but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> in pyramidal neurons of SZ brains</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Counts of reelin mRNA-positive neurons in Brodmann 's area 10 of either nonpsychiatric subjects or SZ patients show that the expression of reelin mRNA is decreased in layer-I , -II , and -IV GABAergic interneurons of SZ patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">These findings are consistent with the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">hypothesis</cue> that the increase of DNA-methyltransferase 1 expression in telencephalic GABAergic interneurons of SZ patients causes a promoter hypermethylation of reelin and GAD(67) and <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">perhaps</cue> of other genes expressed in these interneurons</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">It is difficult to decide <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">whether</cue> this dysfunction of GABAergic neurons detected in SZ is responsible for this disease <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">or</cue> is a consequence of this disorder</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Although at present we cannot differentiate between these two alternatives , <scope type="spec" id="7"> it is important to consider that so far a molecular pathology of cortical GABAergic neurons <cue type="spec" id="7">appears</cue> to be the most consistent finding associated with SZ morbidity</scope> .</sentence>
