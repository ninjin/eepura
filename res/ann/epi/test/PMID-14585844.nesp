<sentence id="0">Regulation of beta1C and beta1A integrin expression in prostate carcinoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">beta(1C) and beta(1A) integrins are two splice variants of the human beta(1) integrin subfamily that act as an inhibitor and a stimulator of cell proliferation , respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In neoplastic prostate epithelium , both these variants are down-regulated at the mRNA level , but only beta(1C) protein levels are reduced .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We used an experimental model consisting of PNT1A , a normal immortalized prostate cell line , and LNCaP and PC-3 , two prostate carcinoma cell lines , to investigate both the transcription/post-transcription and translation/post-translation processes of beta(1C) and beta(1A) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Transcriptional regulation played the key role for the reduction in beta(1C) and beta(1A) mRNA expression in cancer cells , as beta(1C) and beta(1A) mRNA half-lives were comparable in normal and cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">beta(1C) translation rate decreased in cancer cells in agreement with the decrease in mRNA levels , whereas beta(1A) translation rate increased more than 2-fold , despite the reduction in mRNA levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Both beta(1C) and beta(1A) proteins were degraded more rapidly in cancer than in normal cells , and pulse-chase experiments showed that intermediates and/or rates of beta(1C) and beta(1A) protein maturation differ in cancer versus normal cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Inhibition of either calpain- or lysosomal-mediated proteolysis increased both beta(1C) and beta(1A) protein levels , the former in normal but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> in cancer cells and the latter</scope> in both cell types , albeit at a higher extent in cancer than in normal cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Interestingly , inhibition of the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway increased expression of ubiquitinated beta(1C) protein <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> affecting beta(1A) protein levels in cancer cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">These results show that transcriptional , translational , and post-translational processes , the last involving the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway , contribute to the selective loss of beta(1C) integrin , a very efficient inhibitor of cell proliferation , in prostate malignant transformation .</sentence>
