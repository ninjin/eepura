<sentence id="0">Polarized secretion of the regulated secretory protein chromogranin A.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Bovine chromogranin A ( CgA ) , together with secreted alkaline phosphatase ( SEAP ) as an external control for apical secretion were expressed in MDCK cells to test <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">if</cue> CgA contains sorting signals for polarized secretion</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">CgA , SEAP , and the endogenous apical marker GP80 were secreted 75-80 % apically .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Basolateral secretion of SEAP was inhibited 40 % by ammonium chloride .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Sulfate labeling and digestion with chondroitinase ABC revealed a 120 kDa proteoglycan-CgA and 75 kDa CgA .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> affect apical secretion of CgA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">As <scope type="neg" id="2">CgA is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> N-glycosylated</scope> , we used tunicamycin to test <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">if</cue> cellular N-glycosylation is required for apical sorting</scope> .</sentence>
