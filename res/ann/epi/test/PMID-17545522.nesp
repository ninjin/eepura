<sentence id="0">Methylation of CASP8 , DCR2 , and HIN-1 in neuroblastoma is associated with poor outcome .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">PURPOSE : Epigenetic aberrations have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of most cancers .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To investigate the clinical significance of epigenetic changes in neuroblastoma , we evaluated the relationship between clinicopathologic variables and the pattern of gene methylation in neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Methylation-specific PCR was used to evaluate the gene methylation status of 19 genes in 14 neuroblastoma cell lines and 8 genes in 70 primary neuroblastoma tumors .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Associations between gene methylation , established prognostic factors , and outcome were evaluated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Log-rank tests were used to identify the number of methylated genes that was most predictive of overall survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : Epigenetic changes were detected in the neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumors , although the pattern of methylation varied .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Eight of the 19 genes analyzed were methylated in > 70 % of the cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="8"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">Epigenetic</cue> changes of four genes were detected in only small numbers of cell lines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">None of the cell lines had methylation of the other seven genes analyzed .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">In primary neuroblastoma tumors , high-risk disease and poor outcome were associated with methylation of DCR2 , CASP8 , and HIN-1 individually .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Although methylation of the other five individual genes was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> predictive of poor outcome</scope> , a trend toward decreased survival was seen in patients with a methylation phenotype , defined as > or = 4 methylated genes ( P = 0.055 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">CONCLUSION : Our study <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicates that</cue> clinically aggressive neuroblastoma tumors have aberrant methylation of multiple genes</scope> and provides a rationale for exploring treatment strategies that include demethylating agents .</sentence>
