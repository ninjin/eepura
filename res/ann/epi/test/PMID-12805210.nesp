<sentence id="0">Role of calnexin in the glycan-independent quality control of proteolipid protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The endoplasmic ( ER ) quality control apparatus ensures that <scope type="neg" id="0">misfolded or unassembled proteins are <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> deployed within the cell</scope> , but are retained in the ER and degraded .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A glycoprotein-specific system involving the ER lectins calnexin and calreticulin is well documented , but very little is known about mechanisms that <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> operate for non-glycosylated proteins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have used a folding mutant of a non- glycosylated membrane protein , proteolipid protein ( PLP ) , to examine the quality control of this class of polypeptide .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We find that calnexin associates with newly synthesized PLP molecules , binding stably to misfolded PLP .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Calnexin also binds stably to an isolated transmembrane domain of PLP , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that this chaperone is able to monitor the folding and assembly of domains within the ER membrane</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Notably , this glycan-independent interaction with calnexin significantly retards the degradation of misfolded PLP .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> that calnexin contributes to the quality control of non-glycosylated polytopic membrane proteins by binding to misfolded or unassembled transmembrane domains</scope> , and discuss our findings in relation to the role of calnexin in the degradation of misfolded proteins .</sentence>
