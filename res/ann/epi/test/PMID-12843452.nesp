<sentence id="0">A PCR-based method for studying DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">DNA methylation is a mechanism for regulation of gene expression in animals ( 1-3 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The addition of a methyl group at the 5-position of cytosine bases occurs exclusively at CpG dinucleotides .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">CpG dinucleotides in the vertebrate genome are underrepresented and amount to 1 % of the genome ( 4 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">However , in some regions of the genome , CpG residues amount to 6 % or more of the dinucleotides in the genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These regions , known as CpG islands , are usually associated with the promoter regions of housekeeping genes and , in contrast to CpGs throughout the genome , are unmethylated ( 5,6 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Methylation of CpG islands occurs only in silenced genes on the inactive X chromosome and in parentally imprinted genes ( 7 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition , CpG islands <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> become methylated upon oncogenic transformation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These alterations in the methylation profile are correlated with silencing of tumor suppressor genes such as p15 , p16 , Rb , VHL , e-cadherin , ER , and HIC1 ( 8 ) .</sentence>
