<sentence id="0">Microheterogeneity of serum glycoproteins in patients with chronic alcohol abuse compared with carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type I.</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Chronic alcohol abuse alters the normal N-glycosylation of transferrin , producing the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This alteration could be similar to that present in patients with carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1 ( CDG1 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We thus compared the alterations of N-glycans present in patients with alcoholism and patients with CDG1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHODS : The N-glycans of serum glycoproteins were compared in sera of patients with alcoholism , patients with CDG1 , and controls by two-dimensional electrophoresis , neuraminidase , peptide:N-glycosidase F , and endoglycosidase F2 treatments .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A specific antibody directed against the amino acid sequence surrounding the N-432 N-glycosylation site of transferrin was prepared ( SZ-350 antibody ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">RESULTS : In patients with alcoholism , the abnormal transferrin and alpha(1)-antitrypsin isoforms were devoid of a variable number of entire N-glycan moieties and were identical with those present in CDG1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In the serum of patients with alcoholism , this finding was less pronounced than in CDG1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast to CDG1 , there was no decrease in clusterin or serum amyloid P in patients with alcoholism .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The SZ-350 antibody recognized only transferrin isoforms with <scope type="spec" id="0"> one <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> no N-glycan moieties</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSION : Antibodies directed against specific N-glycosylation sites of glycoproteins could be useful for developing more specific immunochemical tests for the diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse .</sentence>
