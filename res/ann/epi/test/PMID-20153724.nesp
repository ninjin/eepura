<sentence id="0">Daxx is reciprocally regulated by Mdm2 and Hausp .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Daxx is a multifunctional protein , regulating a wide range of important functions including apoptosis and transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the way Daxx is regulated is poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In our previous studies , we have found that Daxx forms a complex with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 and the de-ubiquitinase Hausp .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the present work , we show that Daxx is ubiquitinated by Mdm2 in both in vitro and in vivo systems and Mdm2 reduces Daxx expression upon over-expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We further demonstrate that Hausp critically controls the cellular level of Daxx most <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">likely</cue> by inducing Daxx de-ubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These results reveal Mdm2 and Hausp as important regulators for Daxx functions by controlling Daxx ubiquitination and stability .</sentence>
