<sentence id="0">Erythrocytosis-associated HIF-2alpha mutations demonstrate a critical role for residues C-terminal to the hydroxylacceptor proline .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A classic physiologic response to hypoxia in humans is the up-regulation of the ERYTHROPOIETIN ( EPO ) gene , which is the central regulator of red blood cell mass .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The EPO gene , in turn , is activated by hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">HIF is a transcription factor consisting of an alpha subunit ( HIF-alpha ) and a beta subunit ( HIF-beta ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Under normoxic conditions , prolyl hydroxylase domain protein ( PHD , also known as HIF prolyl hydroxylase and egg laying-defective nine protein ) site specifically hydroxylates HIF-alpha in a conserved LXXLAP motif ( where underlining <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicates</cue> the hydroxylacceptor proline</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This provides a recognition motif for the von Hippel Lindau protein , a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets hydroxylated HIF-alpha for degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Under hypoxic conditions , this inherently oxygen-dependent modification is arrested , thereby stabilizing HIF-alpha and allowing it to activate the EPO gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We previously identified and characterized an erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutation , G537W .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">More recently , we reported two additional erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutations , G537R and M535V .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Here , we describe the functional characterization of these two mutants as well as a third novel erythrocytosis-associated mutation , P534L .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">These mutations affect residues C-terminal to the LXXLAP motif .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We find that all result in impaired degradation and thus aberrant stabilization of HIF-2alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">However , each exhibits a distinct profile with respect to their effects on PHD2 binding and von Hippel Lindau interaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">These findings reinforce the importance of HIF-2alpha in human EPO regulation , demonstrate heterogeneity of functional defects arising from these mutations , and point to a critical role for residues C-terminal to the LXXLAP motif in HIF-alpha .</sentence>
