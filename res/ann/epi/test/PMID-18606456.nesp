<sentence id="0">Rapid histone deacetylation and transient HDAC association in the IL-2 promoter region of TSST-1-stimulated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It remains <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue> how superantigen induces unresponsiveness in stimulated T cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We analyzed the chromatin status of the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) promoter region in T cells stimulated with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 ( TSST-1 ) superantigen using T cell receptor-transgenic T cells responding to ovalbumin ( OVA ) and TSST-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Compared to OVA stimulation , naive T cells cultured with TSST-1 showed lower IL-2 expression after transient enhancement .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Coincidentally , the acetylated histone H3 ( AcH3 ) level at the IL-2 promoter region was first enhanced , and then decreased , in TSST-1-stimulated T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">At the reduction stage of AcH3 , histone deacetylase-1 ( HDAC1 ) was markedly associated with the IL-2 promoter region in a TSST-1-specific manner <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">without</cue> HDAC1 over-expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The enhancement of HDAC1 association and IL-2 suppression was prevented by pre-treatment with HDAC inhibitor , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> once the anergy status</scope> was established .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that recruitment of HDAC1 in the IL-2 promoter region at the early stimulation stage with TSST-1 plays a pivotal role in sAg-induced anergy</scope> .</sentence>
