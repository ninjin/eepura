<sentence id="0">Posttranslational modifications in human plasma MBL and human recombinant MBL .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mannan-binding lectin ( MBL ) is a complex serum protein that plays an important role in innate immunity .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In addition to assuming several different oligomeric forms , the polypeptide itself is highly heterogeneous .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">This heterogeneity is due to post-translational modifications , which help to stabilize the intact protein in its active conformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">For the first time , positions and occupation frequency of partial hydroxylations and partial glycosylations are reported in MBL .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hydroxylation and glycosylation patterns of both recombinant and plasma derived MBL were determined , using a combination of mass spectrometry on reduced MBL and on enzyme cleaved MBL .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Variations in the degree of hydroxylation and glycosylation <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">seem</cue> to be an indigenous characteristic of collectins</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In addition to these already known modifications , a new post-translational modification was identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Cys(216) ( and occasionally also Cys(202) ) was modified in trace amounts to dehydroalanine , as detected by a 34 Da mass loss .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">This impairs the formation of a disulphide bond in the carbohydrate recognition domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The dehydroalanine was identified in similar small amounts in both recombinant and plasma-derived MBL .</sentence>
