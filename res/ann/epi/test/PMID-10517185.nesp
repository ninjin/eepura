<sentence id="0">Modulation of keratan sulfate synthesis on lumican by the action of cytokines on human articular chondrocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Adult human articular chondrocytes were used to investigate why keratan sulfate/polylactosamine chains are deficient on the lumican residing in the matrix of adult articular cartilage , whereas they are present on the lumican residing in the matrix of juvenile cartilage .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Under serum-free conditions with either monolayer cultures , agarose cultures , or micromass cultures , the adult chondrocytes synthesized a form of lumican possessing keratan sulfate/polylactosamine chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus , the adult chondrocytes are capable of producing a proteoglycan form of lumican and <scope type="spec" id="0"> this <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be the default synthesis preference</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The micromass culture system proved useful for demonstrating that growth factors/cytokines present in the extracellular milieu are capable of influencing the structure of the keratan sulfate/polylactosamine chains on the secreted lumican .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Of particular note was the ability of IL-1beta to promote the secretion of a form of lumican deficient in keratan sulfate/polylactosamine chains , whereas with bFGF , IGF-1 and TGFbeta keratan sulfate/polylactosamine chains were present , though their size or degree of substitution varied .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Thus , growth factors/cytokines are able to modulate the molecular form of lumican .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , additional studies showed that this modulation was <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> due to the degradation of keratan sulfate/polylactosamine chains following proteoglycan secretion</scope> , but represented a direct effect on synthesis .</sentence>
