Rabbit secretory components of different allotypes vary in their carbohydrate content and their sites of N-linked glycosylation. 
The asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in rabbit high and low Mr secretory components (SC) have been determined for the three known allotypes, t61, t62, and t63. Purified SC polypeptides were subjected to mild periodate oxidation of terminal nonreducing sugars followed by selective reduction with [3H]sodium borohydride, SC polypeptides were further proteolytically cleaved, and the 3H-labeled peptides were isolated and characterized. Both high and low Mr SCs of the three allotypes possess a common glycosylation site at the asparagine residue position 400, whereas the second site, in the amino-terminal domain of SC, was found to be variable: the t61 and t63 allotypes contained a glycosylation site at positions 70 and 90, respectively. Moreover, although the t62 allotype was found to contain a triplet acceptor site (N-X-S) at positions 90-92, analyses showed that less than 30% of the t62 allotype peptides encompassing this region were glycosylated at residue 90. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the t61 SC in the region of residues 69-90 varies by 8 and 10 amino acid substitutions when compared with the t62 and t63 allotype sequences, respectively. However, neither the variation in amino acid sequence nor the variation in degree or site of glycosylation measurably affected the non-covalent binding of domain 1 to dimeric IgA.
