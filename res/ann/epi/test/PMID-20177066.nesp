<sentence id="0">Ubiquitination of PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homolog ) inhibits phosphatase activity and is enhanced by membrane targeting and hyperosmotic stress .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homolog ) tumor suppressor is a phosphatase that inhibits phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent signaling by metabolizing the phosphoinositide lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PtdInsP(3) ) at the plasma membrane .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PTEN can be mono- or polyubiquitinated , and <scope type="spec" id="0"> this <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to control its nuclear localization and stability , respectively</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although PTEN phosphorylation at a cluster of C-terminal serine and threonine residues has been shown to stabilize the protein and inhibit <scope type="spec" id="1"> polyubiquitination and plasma membrane localization , details of the regulation of ubiquitination are <cue type="spec" id="1">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we show that plasma membrane targeting of PTEN greatly enhances PTEN ubiquitination and that phosphorylation of PTEN in vitro does <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affect subsequent ubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">These data <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that C-terminal phosphorylation indirectly regulates ubiquitination by controlling membrane localization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also show that either mono- or polyubiquitination in vitro greatly reduces PTEN phosphatase activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Finally , we show that hyperosmotic stress increases both PTEN ubiquitination and cellular PtdInsP(3) levels well before a reduction in PTEN protein levels is observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Both PTEN ubiquitination and elevated PtdInsP(3) levels were reduced within 10 min after removal of the hyperosmotic stress .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> ubiquitination <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> represent a regulated mechanism of direct reversible control over the PTEN enzyme</scope></scope> .</sentence>
