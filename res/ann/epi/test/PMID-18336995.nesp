<sentence id="0">T3-mediated expression of PGC-1alpha via a far upstream located thyroid hormone response element .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Thyroid hormone ( T3 ) has a profound influence on normal development , differentiation and metabolism .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">T3 induces complex gene expression patterns raises the question of how <scope type="spec" id="0"> these expression patterns <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> be regulated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Since the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha ( PGC-1alpha ) induces very similar cellular energy metabolic pathways , we investigated the molecular mechanism of T3 regulation of PGC-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">PGC-1alpha is rapidly regulated by T3 , both in vivo and in cell culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Transient transfection experiments demonstrated binding of the thyroid hormone receptor ( TR ) to a response element located at -4kb upstream of the transcriptional start site within the PGC-1alpha gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Introducing of a single copy of the -4kb TRE in a heterologous promoter context is sufficient to maintain T3 responsiveness .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed increased histone acetylation upon stimulation of T3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Finally , TR binds the -4kb TRE in electrophoretic mobility shift assays , identifying PGC-1alpha as a direct target of TR action .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Since T3 directly regulates PGC-1alpha and PGC-1alpha coactivates liganded TR , we <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> an autoregulatory feed-forward loop of PGC-1alpha activation upon T3 treatment</scope> .</sentence>
