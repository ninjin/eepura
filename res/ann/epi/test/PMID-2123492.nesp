<sentence id="0">Selective carboxyl methylation of structurally altered calmodulins in Xenopus oocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The eucaryotic protein carboxyl methyltransferase specifically modifies atypical D-aspartyl and L-isoaspartyl residues which are generated spontaneously as proteins age .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The selectivity of the enzyme for altered proteins in intact cells was explored by co-injecting Xenopus laevis oocytes with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine and structurally altered calmodulins generated during a 14-day preincubation in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Control experiments <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicated that</cue> <scope type="neg" id="0">the oocyte protein carboxyl methyltransferase was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> saturated with endogenous substrates</scope></scope> , since <scope type="spec" id="2"> protein carboxyl methylation rates <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> be stimulated up to 8-fold by increasing concentrations of injected calmodulin</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The oocyte protein carboxyl methyltransferase showed strong selectivities for bovine brain and bacterially synthesized calmodulins which had been preincubated in the presence of 1 mM EDTA relative to calmodulins which had been preincubated with 1 mM CaCl2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Radioactive methyl groups were incorporated into base-stable linkages with recombinant calmodulin as well as into carboxyl methyl esters following its microinjection into oocytes .</sentence>
