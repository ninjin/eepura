<sentence id="0">Induction of histone acetylation on the CRBPII gene in perinatal rat small intestine .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The expression of genes associated with lipid and vitamin A metabolism is elevated when the small intestinal mucosa is maturing rapidly during the perinatal period .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have previously reported that cellular retinol-binding protein type II ( CRBPII ) mRNA levels rise abruptly in the rat small intestine during this period .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we examined <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is involved in the intestinal expression of CRBPII during the perinatal stage</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 genes , which are markers of cell proliferation , decreased markedly during the perinatal period , whereas expression of CRBPII as well as villin , a marker of intestinal maturation , increased rapidly .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Using a ChIP assay , we showed rapid induction of acetylation of the histones H3 and H4 which interacted with the promoter/enhancer region of the CRBPII gene at this time .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The binding of CBP and p300 , which have histone acetyltransferase activity , as well as binding of retinoid X receptor alpha ( RXRalpha ) increased on the CRBPII promoter/enhancer region during the perinatal period .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that CRBPII gene expression during the perinatal period is associated with abrupt acetylation of histones H3 and H4 followed by the binding of CBP/p300 and RXRalpha</scope> .</sentence>
