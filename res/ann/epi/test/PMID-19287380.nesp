<sentence id="0">Protein kinase DYRK2 is a scaffold that facilitates assembly of an E3 ligase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein kinases have central functions in various cellular signal transduction pathways through their substrate phosphorylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we show that a protein kinase , DYRK2 , has unexpected role as a scaffold for an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">DYRK2 associates with an E3 ligase complex containing EDD , DDB1 and VPRBP proteins ( EDVP complex ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Strikingly , DYRK2 serves as a scaffold for the EDVP complex , because small-interfering-RNA-mediated depletion of DYRK2 disrupts the formation of the EDD-DDB1-VPRBP complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Although the kinase activity of DYRK2 is dispensable for its ability to mediate EDVP complex formation , it is required for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its downstream substrate , katanin p60 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Collectively , our results reveal a new type of E3-ubiquitin ligase complex in humans that depends on a protein kinase for complex formation as well as for the subsequent phosphorylation , ubiquitylation and degradation of their substrates .</sentence>
