<sentence id="0">Salmonella secreted factor L deubiquitinase of Salmonella typhimurium inhibits NF-kappaB , suppresses IkappaBalpha ubiquitination and modulates innate immune responses .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Salmonella enterica translocates virulent factors into host cells using type III secretion systems to promote host colonization , intracellular bacterial replication and survival , and disease pathogenesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Among many effectors , the type III secretion system encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 translocates a Salmonella-specific protein , designated Salmonella secreted factor L ( SseL ) , a <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> virulence factor possessing deubiquitinase activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In this study , we attempt to elucidate the mechanism and the function of SseL in vitro , in primary host macrophages and in vivo in infected mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Expression of SseL in mammalian cells suppresses NF-kappaB activation downstream of IkappaBalpha kinases and impairs IkappaBalpha ubiquitination and degradation , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> IkappaBalpha phosphorylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Disruption of the gene encoding SseL in S. enterica serovar typhimurium increases IkappaBalpha degradation and ubiquitination , as well as NF-kappaB activation in infected macrophages , compared with wild-type bacteria .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Mice infected with SseL-deficient bacteria mount stronger inflammatory responses , associated with increased production of NF-kappaB-dependent cytokines .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , SseL represents one of the first bacterial deubiquitinases demonstrated to modulate the host inflammatory response in vivo .</sentence>
