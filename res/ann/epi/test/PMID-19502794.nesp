<sentence id="0">NBR1 and p62 as cargo receptors for selective autophagy of ubiquitinated targets .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved cell survival process for degradation of long-lived proteins , damaged organelles and protein aggregates .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The mammalian proteins p62 and NBR1 are selectively degraded by autophagy and can act as cargo receptors or adaptors for the autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Despite differing in size and primary sequence , both proteins share a similar domain architecture containing an N-terminal PB1 domain , a LIR motif interacting with ATG8 family proteins , and a C-terminal UBA domain interacting with ubiquitin .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The LIR motif is essential for their autophagic degradation , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> ATG8 family proteins are responsible for the docking of p62 and NBR1 to nucleating autophagosomes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">p62 and NBR1 co-operate in the sequestration of misfolded and ubiquitinated proteins in p62 bodies and are both required for their degradation by autophagy .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Here we discuss the role of p62 and NBR1 in degradation of ubiquitinated cargoes and the <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">putative</cue> role of LIR as a general motif for docking of proteins to ATG8 family proteins</scope> .</sentence>
