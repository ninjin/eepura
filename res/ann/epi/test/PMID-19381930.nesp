<sentence id="0">In vitro and in vivo assays for studying histone ubiquitination and deubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Posttranslational histone modifications play important roles in regulating chromatin structure and function ( Martin and Zhang , Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 6:838-849 , 2005 ; Jenuwein and Allis , Science 293:1074-1080 , 2001 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">One example of such modifications is histone ubiquitination , which occurs predominately on H2A and H2B .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Recent studies have highlighted important regulatory roles of H2A ubiquitination in Polycomb group proteins-mediated gene silencing ( Wang et al. , Nature 431:873-878 , 2004 ; Joo et al. , Nature 449:1068-1072 , 2007 ) and H2B ubiquitination in transcription , H3 methylation , and DNA methylation ( Zhang , Genes Dev 17:2733-2740 , 2003 ; Sun and Allis , Nature 418:104-108 , 2002 ; Sridhar et al. , Nature 447:735-738 , 2007 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we describe methods for in vitro histone ubiquitination and deubiquitination assays .</sentence>
