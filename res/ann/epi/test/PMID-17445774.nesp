<sentence id="0">Studies of the in vitro Nalpha-acetyltransferase activities of E. coli RimL protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Although the Escherichia coli N(alpha)-acetyltransferase RimL catalyzing the N-terminal acetylation of L12 have been identified through mutant analysis , little is known about its enzymatic activity and auxiliary subunit requirement .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This study was to investigate the enzymatic activities of RimL and its substrate specificity .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">RimL , its substrate L12 , and two mutant substrates L12S1A and L12I2D were overexpressed and purified from E. coli .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In vitro experimental results revealed that RimL itself can convert L12 to L7 by acetylation of the N-terminal serine residue .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The K(m) value for L12 was 0.55 microM and the V(max) was 25.71 min(-1) as determined by a spectrophotometrical method .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">We also found that RimL acetylated the L12S1A mutant with an N-terminal alanine residue instead of the native serine residue , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> RimL can acetylate other N-terminal residues</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , when the second N-terminal residue isoleucine was replaced by aspartic acid , the mutant L12I2D was also acetylated by RimL but under a much lower rate .</sentence>
