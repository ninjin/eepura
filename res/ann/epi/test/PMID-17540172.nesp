<sentence id="0">L3MBTL1 , a histone-methylation-dependent chromatin lock .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Distinct histone lysine methylation marks are involved in transcriptional repression linked to the formation and maintenance of facultative heterochromatin , although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We demonstrate that the malignant-brain-tumor ( MBT ) protein L3MBTL1 is in a complex with core histones , histone H1b , HP1gamma , and Rb. The MBT domain is structurally related to protein domains that directly bind methylated histone residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Consistent with this , we found that the L3MBTL1 MBT domains compact nucleosomal arrays dependent on mono- and dimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 and of histone H1b lysine 26 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The MBT domains bind at least two nucleosomes simultaneously , linking repression of transcription to recognition of different histone marks by L3MBTL1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Consistently , L3MBTL1 was found to negatively regulate the expression of a subset of genes regulated by E2F , a factor that interacts with Rb.</sentence>
