<sentence id="0">Circadian rhythm transcription factor CLOCK regulates the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor by acetylating its hinge region lysine cluster : potential physiological implications .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Glucocorticoids , end products of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , influence functions of virtually all organs and tissues through the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Circulating levels of glucocorticoids fluctuate naturally in a circadian fashion and regulate the transcriptional activity of GR in target tissues .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The basic helix-loop-helix protein CLOCK , a histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) , and its heterodimer partner BMAL1 are self-oscillating transcription factors that generate circadian rhythms in both the central nervous system and periphery .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We found that CLOCK/BMAL1 repressed GR-induced transcriptional activity in a HAT-activity- dependent fashion .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In serum-shock-synchronized cells , transactivational activity of GR , accessed by mRNA expression of an endogenous-responsive gene , fluctuated spontaneously in a circadian fashion in reverse phase with CLOCK/BMAL1 mRNA expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">CLOCK and GR interacted with each other physically , and CLOCK suppressed binding of GR to its DNA recognition sequences by acetylating multiple lysine residues located in its hinge region .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> CLOCK/BMAL1 functions as a reverse-phase negative regulator of glucocorticoid action in target tissues , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">possibly</cue> by antagonizing biological actions of diurnally fluctuating circulating glucocorticoids</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Further , these results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that a peripheral target tissue circadian rhythm indirectly influences the functions of every organ and tissue inside the body through modulation of the ubiquitous and diverse actions of glucocorticoids</scope> .</sentence>
