<sentence id="0">Erythropoietin structure-function relationships .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Mutant proteins that test a model of tertiary structure .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">On the basis of its primary sequence and the location of its disulfide bonds , we <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">propose</cue> a structural model of the erythropoietic hormone erythropoietin ( Epo ) which predicts a four alpha-helical bundle motif , in common with other cytokines</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In order to test this model , site-directed mutants were prepared by high level transient expression in Cos7 cells and analyzed by a radioimmuno assay and by bioassays utilizing mouse and human Epo-dependent cell lines .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Deletions of 5 to 8 residues within predicted alpha-helices resulted in the failure of export of the mutant protein from the cell .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In contrast , deletions at the NH2 terminus ( delta 2-5 ) , the COOH terminus ( delta 163-166 ) , or in predicted interhelical loops ( AB : delta 32-36 , delta 53-57 ; BC : delta 78-82 ; CD : delta 111-119 ) resulted in the export of immunologically detectable Epo muteins that were biologically active .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The mutein delta 48-52 could be readily detected by radioimmunoassay but had markedly decreased biological activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , replacement of each of these deleted residues by serine resulted in Epo muteins with full biological activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Replacement of Cys29 and Cys33 by tyrosine residues also resulted in the export of fully active Epo .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Therefore , this small disulfide loop is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> critical to Epo 's stability or function</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The properties of the muteins that we tested are consistent with our proposed model of tertiary structure .</sentence>
