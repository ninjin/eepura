<sentence id="0">Chromosomal integration of retinoic acid response elements prevents cooperative transcriptional activation by retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">All-trans-retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors ( RXR ) are nuclear receptors known to cooperatively activate transcription from retinoid-regulated promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">By comparing the transactivating properties of RAR and RXR in P19 cells using either plasmid or chromosomal reporter genes containing the mRAR beta 2 gene promoter , we found contrasting patterns of transcriptional regulation in each setting .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Cooperativity between RXR and RAR occurred at all times with transiently introduced promoters , but was restricted to a very early stage ( < 3 h ) for chromosomal promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This time-dependent loss of cooperativity was specific for chromosomal templates containing two copies of a retinoid-responsive element ( RARE ) and <scope type="neg" id="0">was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> influenced by the spacing between the two RAREs</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This loss of cooperativity <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggested</cue> a delayed acquisition of RAR full transcriptional competence because ( i ) cooperativity was maintained at RAR ligand subsaturating concentrations</scope> , ( ii ) overexpression of SRC-1 led to loss of cooperativity and even to strong repression of chromosomal templates activity , and ( iii ) loss of cooperativity was observed when additional cis-acting response elements were activated .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Surprisingly , histone deacetylase inhibitors counteracted this loss of cooperativity by repressing partially RAR-mediated activation of chromosomal promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="2">Loss of cooperativity was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> correlated to local histone hyperacetylation or to alteration of constitutive RNA polymerase II ( RNAP ) loading at the promoter region</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Unexpectedly , RNAP binding to transcribed regions was correlated to the RAR activation state as well as to acetylation levels of histones H3 and H4 , <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggesting</cue> that RAR acts at the mRAR beta promoter by triggering the switch from an RNA elongation-incompetent RNAP form towards an RNA elongation-competent RNAP</scope> .</sentence>
