<sentence id="2">To explore the molecular mechanism of activation , we screened genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated by hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Fibroblasts isolated from fetal rat lung were cultured under hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Differential display technique showed that the mRNA level of prolyl 4-hydroxylase ( PH ) alpha(I) , an active subunit that catalyzes the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of proline residue in procollagen , increased 2-3-fold after an 8-h exposure to hypoxia .</sentence>
