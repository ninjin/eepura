<sentence id="0">SAGA-mediated H2B deubiquitination controls the development of neuronal connectivity in the Drosophila visual system .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Nonstop , which has previously been shown to have homology to ubiquitin proteases , is required for proper termination of axons R1-R6 in the optic lobe of the developing Drosophila eye .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Herein , we establish that Nonstop actually functions as an ubiquitin protease to control the levels of ubiquitinated histone H2B in flies .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We further establish that Nonstop is the functional homolog of yeast Ubp8 , and can substitute for Ubp8 function in yeast cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In yeast , Ubp8 activity requires Sgf11 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We show that in Drosophila , loss of Sgf11 function causes similar photoreceptor axon-targeting defects as loss of Nonstop .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Ubp8 and Sgf11 are components of the yeast SAGA complex , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="1"> Nonstop function <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> be mediated through the Drosophila SAGA complex</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Indeed , we find that Nonstop does associate with SAGA components in flies , and mutants in other SAGA subunits display nonstop phenotypes , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">indicating that</cue> SAGA complex is required for accurate axon guidance in the optic lobe</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Candidate genes regulated by SAGA that <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be required for correct axon targeting were identified by microarray analysis of gene expression in SAGA mutants</scope> .</sentence>
