<sentence id="0">Independent function of two destruction domains in hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha chains activated by prolyl hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Oxygen-dependent proteolytic destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha ( HIF-alpha ) subunits plays a central role in regulating transcriptional responses to hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Recent studies have defined a key function for the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor E3 ubiquitin ligase ( VHLE3 ) in this process , and have defined an interaction with HIF-1 alpha that is regulated by prolyl hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we show that two independent regions within the HIF-alpha oxygen-dependent degradation domain ( ODDD ) are targeted for ubiquitylation by VHLE3 in a manner dependent upon prolyl hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In a series of in vitro and in vivo assays , we demonstrate the independent and non-redundant operation of each site in regulation of the HIF system .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Both sites contain a common core motif , but differ both in overall sequence and in the conditions under which they bind to the VHLE3 ligase complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The definition of two independent destruction domains implicates a more complex system of pVHL-HIF-alpha interactions , but reinforces the role of prolyl hydroxylation as an oxygen-dependent destruction signal .</sentence>
