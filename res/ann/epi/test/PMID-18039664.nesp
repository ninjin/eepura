<sentence id="0">In vitro reconstitution of plant Atg8 and Atg12 conjugation systems essential for autophagy .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Genetic and biochemical analyses using yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems , the Atg8 and Atg12 systems , exist and play essential roles in autophagy , the bulk degradation system conserved in yeast and mammals .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These conjugation systems are also conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana ; however , further detailed study of plant ATG ( autophagy-related ) conjugation systems in relation to those in yeast and mammals is needed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here , we describe the in vitro reconstitution of Arabidopsis thaliana ATG8 and ATG12 ( AtATG8 and AtATG12 ) conjugation systems using purified recombinant proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">AtATG12b was conjugated to AtATG5 in a manner dependent on AtATG7 , AtATG10 , and ATP , whereas AtATG8a was conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) in a manner dependent on AtATG7 , AtATG3 , and ATP .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Other AtATG8 homologs ( AtATG8b-8i ) were similarly conjugated to PE .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The AtATG8 conjugates were deconjugated by AtATG4a and AtATG4b .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results support the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">hypothesis</cue> that the ATG conjugation systems in Arabidopsis are very similar to those in yeast and mammals</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Intriguingly , in vitro analyses showed that AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates accelerated the formation of AtATG8-PE , whereas AtATG3 inhibited the formation of AtATG12-AtATG5 conjugates .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The in vitro conjugation systems reported here will afford a tool with which to investigate the cross-talk mechanism between two conjugation systems .</sentence>
