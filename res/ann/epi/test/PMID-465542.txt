Collagen synthesis by cultured skin fibroblasts from siblings with hydroxylysine-deficient collagen. 
It has been previously shown that dermis from subjects with hydroxylysine-deficient collagen contains approximately 5% of normal levels of hydroxylysine and sonicates of skin fibroblasts contain less than 15% of normal levels of collagen lysyl hydroxylase activity. However, cultures of dermal fibroblasts from two siblings with hydroxylysine-deficient collagen (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type VI) compared to fibroblasts from normal subjects synthesize collagen containing approximately 50% of normal amounts of hydroxylysine. The lysyl hydroxylase deficient cultures synthesize both Type I and Type III collagen in the same proportion as control cultures. Both alpha 1(I) and alpha 2 chains are similarly reduced in hydroxylysine content. Collagen prolyl hydroxylation by normal collagen lysyl hydroxylation is the same with or without ascorbate supplementation. In mutant cells the rate of prolyl hydroxylation measured after release of inhibition by alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl is the same as in control cells. The rate of lysyl hydroxylation is reduced in mutant cells but only to approximately 50% of normal.
