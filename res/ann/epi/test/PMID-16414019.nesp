<sentence id="0">Prion protein-related proteins from zebrafish are complex glycosylated and contain a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A hallmark of prion diseases in mammals is a conformational transition of the cellular prion protein ( PrP(C) ) into a pathogenic isoform termed PrP(Sc) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">PrP(C) is highly conserved in mammals , moreover , genes of PrP-related proteins have been recently identified in fish .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">While there is only little sequence homology to mammalian PrP , PrP-related fish proteins were <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">predicted</cue> to be modified with N-linked glycans and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We biochemically characterized two PrP-related proteins from zebrafish in cultured cells and show that both zePrP1 and zeSho2 are imported into the endoplasmic reticulum and are post-translationally modified with complex glycans and a C-terminal GPI anchor .</sentence>
