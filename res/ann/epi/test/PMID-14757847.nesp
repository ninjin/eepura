<sentence id="0">Role of the DNA methyltransferase variant DNMT3b3 in DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Several alternatively spliced variants of DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT ) 3b have been described .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we identified new murine Dnmt3b mRNA isoforms and found that mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells expressed only Dnmt3b transcripts that contained exons 10 and 11 , whereas the Dnmt3b transcripts in somatic cells <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">lacked</cue> these exons</scope> , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that this region is important for embryonic development</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">DNMT3b2 and 3b3 were the major isoforms expressed in human cell lines and the mRNA levels of these isoforms closely correlated with their protein levels .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although DNMT3b3 <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be catalytically inactive</scope> , it still <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> be biologically important because D4Z4 and satellites 2 and 3 repeat sequences , all known DNMT3b target sequences , were methylated in cells that predominantly expressed DNMT3b3</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Treatment of cells with the mechanism-based inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) caused a complete depletion of DNMT1 , 3a , 3b1 , and 3b2 proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Human DNMT3b3 and the murine Dnmt3b3-like isoform , Dnmt3b6 , were also depleted although less efficiently , <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">suggesting</cue> that DNMT3b3 also <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">may</cue> be capable of DNA binding</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Moreover , de novo methylation of D4Z4 in T24 cancer cells after 5-Aza-CdR treatment only occurred when DNMT3b3 was expressed , reinforcing its role as a contributing factor of DNA methylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The expression of either DNMT3b2 or 3b3 , however , was <scope type="neg" id="6"><cue type="neg" id="6">not</cue> sufficient to explain the abnormal methylation of DNMT3b target sequences in human cancers , which <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">may</cue> therefore be dependent on factors that affect DNMT3b targeting</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Methylation analyses of immunodeficiency , chromosomal instabilities , and facial abnormalities cells revealed that an Alu repeat sequence was highly methylated , <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">suggesting</cue> that Alu sequences are <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> DNMT3b targets</scope></scope> .</sentence>
