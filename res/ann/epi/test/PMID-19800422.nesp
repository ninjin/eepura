<sentence id="0">The role of asparagine-linked glycosylation site on the catalytic domain of matriptase in its zymogen activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Matriptase is a type II transmembrane serine protease containing one <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">potential</cue> site for asparagine-linked glycosylation ( N-glycosylation ) on the catalytic domain ( Asn772</scope> ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It has been found that the activation of matriptase zymogen occurs via a mechanism requiring its own activity and that the N-glycosylation site is critical for the activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The present study aimed to determine the underlying reasons for the site requirement using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing recombinant variants of rat matriptase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4"><scope type="spec" id="2"> A full-length variant with glutamine substitution at Asn772 <cue type="spec" id="2">appeared</cue> to be <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">unable</cue> to undergo activation because of its catalytic incompetence ( i.e. , decreased availability of the soluble catalytic domain and/or of the correctly folded domain</scope> )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This was evidenced by the observations that ( i ) a recombinant catalytic domain of matriptase with glutamine substitution at the site corresponding to matriptase Asn772 [ N772Q-CD-Myc(His)(6) ] was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> detected in the medium conditioned by transfected cells</scope> but was on the cell surface and ( ii ) purified N772Q-CD-Myc(His)(6) exhibited markedly reduced activity toward a peptide substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It is concluded that N-glycosylation site at Asn772 of matriptase is required for the zymogen activation because it plays an important role in rendering this protease catalytically competent in the cellular environment .</sentence>
