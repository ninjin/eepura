E1002	Speculation:T1004 Scope:T1005
T1005	Span 1439 1589	indicated that the histones H3 and H4 associated with the promoter and the 5' region of uidA were hyperacetylated in the presence of the PetE enhancer

E1004	Speculation:T1008 Scope:T1009
T1009	Span 1769 1998	suggest that the pea PetE enhancer activates transcription by associating with the nuclear matrix, mediating the acetylation of histones on the promoter and the nearby coding region and resulting in an altered chromatin structure
