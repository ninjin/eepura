The transcriptional enhancer of the pea plastocyanin gene associates with the nuclear matrix and regulates gene expression through histone acetylation. 
The influence of the transcriptional enhancer of the pea plastocyanin gene (PetE) on the acetylation of histones was examined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using antibodies that recognize acetylated or nonacetylated histones H3 and H4. In transgenic tobacco plants containing the pea PetE promoter fused to uidA, both acetylated and nonacetylated histones H3 and H4 were present on the integrated transgene. Linking the PetE enhancer to the transgene resulted in increased beta-glucuronidase activity and increased amounts of acetylated histones H3 and H4 present on the promoter, suggesting that the enhancer may increase transcription by mediating the acetylation of histones. Trichostatin A and sodium butyrate, which are potent inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAs), activated expression from the PetE promoter by fourfold, with a concomitant increase in the acetylation states of histones H3 and H4, as determined by ChIP, indicating that the acetylation of histones has a direct positive effect on transcription. The HDA inhibitors did not increase expression from the PetE promoter when it was linked to the enhancer, consistent with preexisting hyperacetylated histones on the transgene. Mapping of histone acetylation states along the reporter gene indicated that the histones H3 and H4 associated with the promoter and the 5' region of uidA were hyperacetylated in the presence of the PetE enhancer. The PetE enhancer bound to isolated tobacco nuclear matrices in vitro and was associated with the nuclear matrix in nuclei isolated from transgenic tobacco plants. These results suggest that the pea PetE enhancer activates transcription by associating with the nuclear matrix, mediating the acetylation of histones on the promoter and the nearby coding region and resulting in an altered chromatin structure.
