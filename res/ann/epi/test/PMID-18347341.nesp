<sentence id="0">PHDs overactivation during chronic hypoxia " desensitizes " HIFalpha and protects cells from necrosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Cell adaptation to changes in oxygen ( O(2) ) availability is controlled by two subfamilies of O(2)-dependent enzymes : the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases [ prolyl hydroxylases domain ( PHDs ) and factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) ] .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These oxygen sensors regulate the activity of the HIF , a transcriptional complex central in O(2) homeostasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In well oxygenated cells , PHDs hydroxylate the HIFalpha subunits , thereby targeting them for proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , acute hypoxia inhibits PHDs , leading to HIFalpha stabilisation .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">However , here we show that chronic hypoxia induces HIF1/2alpha"desensitization " in cellulo and in mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">At the basis of this general adaptative mechanism , we demonstrate that chronic hypoxia not only increases the pool of PHDs but also overactivates the three PHD isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="spec" id="0"> This overactivation <cue type="spec" id="0">appears</cue> to be mediated by an increase in intracellular O(2) availability consequent to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">By using in cellulo and in vivo siRNA , we found that the PHDs are the key enzymes triggering HIFalpha desensitization , a feedback mechanism required to protect cells against necrotic cell death and thus to adapt them across a chronic hypoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Hence , PHDs serve as dual enzymes , for which inactivation and later overactivation is necessary for cell survival in acute or chronic hypoxia , respectively .</sentence>
