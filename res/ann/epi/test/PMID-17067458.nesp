<sentence id="0">[ Expression of DNA methyltransferases in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma and its association with the CpG islands methylation of tumor suppressor genes ]</sentence>
<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : To investigate the role of DNA methyltransferases ( DNMT ) in carcinogenesis and development of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) by detection the expression of DNMT in ACC and to assess its correlation to methylation of tumor suppressor genes and biological behavior of ACC .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">METHODS : The protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b were examined by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues of ACC from 60 patients .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The association between the positive staining of DNMT1 and DNMT3b microscopically and the CpG islands methylation status of some tumor suppressor genes , tumor grade and stage was analysed by Fisher exact test .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">RESULTS : The number of DNMT1 positive cells was much more than that of DNMT3b ( P < 0.01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The positive expression of DNMT1 was increased concomitantly to the amounts of methylation of tumor suppressor genes occurred in ACC and was significantly correlated to the methylation status of RASSF1A ( P < 0.01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A difference was found between the more and less methylation of tumor suppressor genes group ( P < 0.05 ) The increased positive expression of DNMT1 correlated to the tumor grade ( P < 0.05 ) and stage ( P < 0.01 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">It was much more expressed in the lower grade or more advanced stage cases .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The correlation between the expression of DNMT3b and <scope type="neg" id="0">the methylation of tumor suppressor genes , tumor grade and stage was <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> found</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">CONCLUSIONS : DNMT1 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> play an important role in the maintenance of methylation of tumor suppressor genes in ACC</scope> and was related correlated to the methylation of RASSF1A , tumor grade and stage , which <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">implied</cue> that DNMT1</scope> <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">may</cue> contribute to the carcinogenesis and development of ACC</scope> and was <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">likely</cue> to be a molecular marker for evaluating the prognosis of patients with ACC</scope> .</sentence>
