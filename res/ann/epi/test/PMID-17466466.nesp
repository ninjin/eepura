<sentence id="0">Reptilian transferrins : evolution of disulphide bridges and conservation of iron-binding center .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Transferrins , found in invertebrates and vertebrates , form a physiologically important family of proteins playing a major role in iron acquisition and transport , defense against microbial pathogens , growth and differentiation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These proteins are bilobal in structure and each lobe is composed of two domains divided by a cleft harboring an iron atom .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Vertebrate transferrins comprise of serotransferrins , lactoferrins and ovotransferrins .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In mammals serotransferrins transport iron in physiological fluids and deliver it to cells , while lactoferrins scavenge iron , limiting its availability to invading microbes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In oviparous vertebrates there is only one transferrin gene , expressed either in the liver to be delivered to physiological fluids as serotransferrin , or in the oviduct with a final localization in egg white as ovotransferrin .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Being products of one gene sero- and ovotransferrin are identical at the amino-acid sequence level but with different , cell specific glycosylation patterns .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">Our</cue> knowledge of the mechanisms of transferrin iron binding and release is based on sequence and structural data obtained for human serotransferrin and hen and duck ovotransferrins</scope> .</sentence>

<sentence id="13">In the present paper , ten new reptilian mRNA transferrin sequences obtained from the Nile crocodile ( NtrF ) , bearded dragon ( BtrF ) , Cuban brown anole ( AtrF ) , veiled and Mediterranean chameleons ( VtrF and KtrF ) , sand lizard ( StrF ) , leopard gecko ( LtrF ) , Burmese python ( PtrF ) , African house snake ( HtrF ) , and grass snake ( GtrF ) are presented and analyzed .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Nile crocodile and red-eared turtle transferrins have a disulphide bridge pattern identical to known bird homologues .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">A partially different disulphide bridge pattern was found in the Squamata ( snakes and lizards ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">The <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possibility</cue> of a unique interdomain disulphide bridge</scope> was predicted for LtrF .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">Differences were found in iron-binding centers from those of previously known transferrins .</sentence>
<sentence id="18">Substitutions were found in the iron-chelating residues of StrF and TtrF and in the synergistic anion-binding residues of NtrF .</sentence>
<sentence id="19">In snakes , <scope type="neg" id="3">the transferrin ( PtrF , HtrF and GtrF ) N-lobe " dilysine trigger " occurring in all other known transferrins was <cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> found</scope> , which <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicates</cue> a different mechanism of iron release</scope> .</sentence>
