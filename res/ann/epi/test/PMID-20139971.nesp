<sentence id="0">Histone H3 Thr 45 phosphorylation is a replication-associated post-translational modification in S. cerevisiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Post-translational histone modifications are crucial for the regulation of numerous DNA-templated processes , and are <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">thought</cue> to mediate both alteration of chromatin dynamics and recruitment of effector proteins to specific regions of the genome</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In particular , histone Ser/Thr phosphorylation regulates multiple nuclear functions in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , including transcription , DNA damage repair , mitosis , apoptosis and sporulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although modifications to chromatin during replication remain poorly understood , a number of recent studies have described acetylation of the histone H3 N-terminal alpha-helix ( alphaN helix ) at Lys 56 as a modification that is important for maintenance of genomic integrity during DNA replication and repair .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here , we report phosphorylation of H3 Thr 45 ( H3-T45 ) , a histone modification also located within the H3 alphaN helix in S. cerevisiae .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Thr 45 phosphorylation peaks during DNA replication , and is mediated by the S phase kinase Cdc7-Dbf4 as part of a multiprotein complex identified in this study .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Furthermore , loss of phosphorylated H3-T45 causes phenotypes consistent with replicative defects , and prolonged replication stress results in H3-T45 phosphorylation accumulation over time .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Notably , the phenotypes described here are independent of Lys 56 acetylation status , and combinatorial mutations to both Thr 45 and Lys 56 of H3 cause synthetic growth defects .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Together , these data identify and characterize H3-T45 phosphorylation as a replication-associated histone modification in budding yeast .</sentence>
