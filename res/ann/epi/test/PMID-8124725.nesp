<sentence id="0">B cell-specific demethylation : a novel role for the intronic kappa chain enhancer sequence .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We studied the molecular mechanism of demethylation and its role in kappa chain gene regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Following transfection into B cell cultures , this gene undergoes regional demethylation in a process that is developmentally regulated in a lineage- and stage-specific manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Although <scope type="neg" id="0">a germline V kappa promoter is <cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> required for the demodification activity</scope> , a fragment containing the intronic kappa chain transcriptional enhancer and the nearby matrix attachment region is essential .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In its natural location downstream to the J kappa 5 sequence , this element induces bidirectional demodification of plasmid constructs in a distance- and orientation-independent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When this enhancer is placed in an upstream position , however , the kappa gene remains modified and transcriptionally inactive , demonstrating that demethylation is required for kappa chain activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These studies <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the kappa enhancer plays a dual role in regulating B cell differentiation by inducing demethylation and by promoting tissue-specific transcription</scope> .</sentence>
