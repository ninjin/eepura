<sentence id="0">Inhibition of histone deacetylation protects wild-type but <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> gelsolin-deficient neurons from oxygen/glucose deprivation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Histone acetylation and deacetylation participate in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this paper , we demonstrate that pre-treatment with the histone deacetylation inhibitor trichostatin A ( TSA ) enhances histone acetylation in primary cortical neurons and protects against oxygen/glucose deprivation , a model for ischaemic cell death in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The actin-binding protein gelsolin was identified as a mediator of neuroprotection by TSA .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">TSA enhanced histone acetylation of the gelsolin promoter region , and up-regulated gelsolin messenger RNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Double-label confocal immunocytochemistry visualized the up-regulation of gelsolin and histone acetylation within the same neuron .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Together with gelsolin up-regulation , TSA pre-treatment decreased levels of filamentous actin .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The neuroprotective effect of TSA was completely abolished in neurons lacking gelsolin gene expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In conclusion , we demonstrate that the enhancement of gelsolin gene expression correlates with neuroprotection induced by the inhibition of histone deacetylation .</sentence>
