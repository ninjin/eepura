<sentence id="0">Hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome : relationship between phenotypes and specific mutations in the iron-responsive element of ferritin light-chain mRNA .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent reports have described families in whom a combination of elevated serum ferritin not related to iron overload and congenital nuclear cataract is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have studied the molecular pathogenesis of hyperferritinemia in two families showing different phenotypic expression of this new genetic disorder .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Serum ferritin levels ranged from 950 to 1,890 microg/L in affected individuals from family 1 , and from 366 to 635 microg/L in those from family 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Cataract was clinically manifested in family 1 and asymptomatic in family 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">By using monoclonal antibodies specific for the H and L ferritin subunits , serum ferritin was found to be essentially L type in both normal and affected individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The latter also showed normal amounts of H-type ferritin in circulating mononuclear cells ; on the contrary , L-type ferritin contents were 13 times normal in family 1 and five times normal in family 2 on average .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Serum ferritin was glycosylated in both normal and affected individuals .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">There was a close relationship between mononuclear cell L-type ferritin content and serum ferritin concentration ( r = 0.95 , P < .00001 ) , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that the excess production of ferritin in cells was directly responsible for the hyperferritinemia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The dysregulated L-subunit synthesis was found to result from different point mutations in a noncoding sequence of genomic L-subunit DNA , which behaves as an mRNA cis-acting element known as iron regulatory element ( IRE ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Affected individuals from family 1 were heterozygous for a point mutation ( a single G to A change ) in the highly conserved , three-nucleotide motif forming the IRE bulge .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Affected members from family 2 were heterozygous for a double point mutation in the IRE lower stem .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Using a gel retardation assay , the observed molecular lesions were shown to variably reduce the IRE affinity for an iron regulatory protein ( IRP ) , which inhibits ferritin mRNA translation .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">The direct relationship between the degree of hyperferritinemia and severity of cataract <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggests</cue> that this latter is the consequence of excessive ferritin production within the lens fibers</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">These findings provide strong evidence that serum ferritin is a byproduct of intracellular ferritin synthesis and that the L-subunit gene on chromosome 19 is the source of glycosylated serum ferritin .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">From a practical standpoint , <scope type="spec" id="2"> this new genetic disorder <cue type="spec" id="2">should</cue> be taken into account by clinicians when facing a high serum ferritin in an apparently healthy person</scope> .</sentence>
