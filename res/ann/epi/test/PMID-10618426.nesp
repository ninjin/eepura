<sentence id="0">Molecular mechanism for silencing virally transduced genes involves histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Virally transduced genes are often silenced after integration into the host genome .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Chromatin immunoprecipitation and nuclease sensitivity experiments now demonstrate that silencing of the transgene is characterized by deacetylation of histone H4 lysines and chromatin condensation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Trichostatin A treatment results in dramatic reactivation of gene expression that is preceded by histone acetylation and chromatin decondensation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Analysis of individual histone H4 lysines demonstrate that chromatin domain opening is coincident with rapid acetylation of histone H4 K5 , K12 , and K16 and that maintenance of the open domain is correlated with acetylation of histone H4 K8 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Removal of trichostatin A results in rapid deacetylation of histone H4 K8 , chromatin condensation , and transcription silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that deacetylation of histone H4 lysines and coincident chromatin condensation are critically involved in the silencing of virally transduced genes</scope> .</sentence>
