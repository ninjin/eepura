<sentence id="0">Negative regulation of T-cell activation and autoimmunity by Mgat5 N-glycosylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">T-cell activation requires clustering of a threshold number of T-cell receptors ( TCRs ) at the site of antigen presentation , a number that is reduced by CD28 co-receptor recruitment of signalling proteins to TCRs .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we demonstrate that a deficiency in beta1,6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V ( Mgat5 ) , an enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway , lowers T-cell activation thresholds by directly enhancing TCR clustering .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Mgat5-deficient mice showed kidney autoimmune disease , enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity , and increased susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Recruitment of TCRs to agonist-coated beads , TCR signalling , actin microfilament re-organization , and agonist-induced proliferation were all enhanced in Mgat5-/- T cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Mgat5 initiates GlcNAc beta1,6 branching on N-glycans , thereby increasing N-acetyllactosamine , the ligand for galectins , which are proteins known to modulate T-cell proliferation and apoptosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Indeed , galectin-3 was associated with the TCR complex at the cell surface , an interaction dependent on Mgat5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Pre-treatment of wild-type T cells with lactose to compete for galectin binding produced a phenocopy of Mgat5 clustering-/- TCR .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> a galectin-glycoprotein lattice strengthened by Mgat5-modified glycans restricts TCR recruitment to the site of antigen presentation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Dysregulation of Mgat5 in humans <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> increase susceptibility to autoimmune diseases , such as multiple sclerosis</scope> .</sentence>
