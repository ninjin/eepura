<sentence id="0">Hydrogen peroxide prolongs nuclear localization of NF-kappaB in activated cells by suppressing negative regulatory mechanisms .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">NF-kappaB transcription factors induce pro-inflammatory molecules ( e.g. IL-8 ) in response to <scope type="spec" id="0"> cytokines ( e.g. TNFalpha , IL-1beta ) <cue type="spec" id="0">or</cue> other stimuli</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the basal state , they are sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IkappaB proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pro-inflammatory signaling triggers polyubiquitination of intermediaries ( e.g. RIP1 ) , which activate IkappaB kinases that trigger Ser phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha , thereby promoting nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">A negative feedback loop exists whereby NF-kappaB drives resynthesis of IkappaBalpha , which promotes export of NF-kappaB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This process relies on Cezanne , a deubiquitinating cysteine protease that stabilizes resynthesized IkappaBalpha by removing polyubiquitin from modified intermediaries .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">H(2)O(2) is generated during inflammation .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Here we examined the effects of H(2)O(2) on NF-kappaB dynamics and pro-inflammatory activation in cultured cells co-stimulated with TNFalpha or IL-1beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that H(2)O(2) enhanced the induction of IL-8 by TNFalpha or IL-1beta .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We demonstrated by using assays of NF-kappaB nuclear localization and by imaging of live cells expressing a fluorescent form of NF-kappaB that H(2)O(2) prolonged NF-kappaB nuclear localization in cells co-stimulated with TNFalpha or IL-1beta by suppressing its export from the nucleus .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We provide evidence that H(2)O(2) suppresses NF-kappaB export by prolonging polyubiquitination of signaling intermediaries , which promotes Ser phosphorylation and destabilization of newly synthesized IkappaBalpha proteins .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Finally , we observed that the catalytic activity of Cezanne and its ability to suppress RIP1 polyubiquitination and NF-kappaB transcriptional activity were inhibited by H(2)O(2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We conclude that H(2)O(2) prolongs NF-kappaB activation in co-stimulated cells by suppressing the negative regulatory functions of Cezanne and IkappaBalpha .</sentence>
