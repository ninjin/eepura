<sentence id="0">Ascorbate induction of collagen synthesis as a means for elucidating a mechanism of quantitative control of tissue-specific function .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Ascorbic acid displays the characteristics of an ideal inducer of tissue-specific function in primary avian tendon cells in culture .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">It is a highly specific , potent stimulator of collagen synthesis , it demonstrates slow reversible kinetics , and it has <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on growth rate of the cultured cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Kinetic analysis of ascorbate induction of collagen synthesis was used to determine the critical steps in this complex biosynthetic pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Full hydroxylation of the proline residues in collagen , although <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">probably</cue> a necessary step for collagen induction , was in itself <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> sufficient</scope> for achieving either increased secretion or increased synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">On the other hand , an increase in secretion rate , which required both the presence of ascorbate and a high cell density , did correlate with the later stimulation in procollagen production .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The process of procollagen secretion , therefore , meets the minimal requirements for the rate-limiting step .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The fact that the cells maintained a large pool of intracellular procollagen despite changes in the rates of translation or secretion led us to postulate a <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">possible</cue> feedback between the level of the internal procollagen pool and the rate of procollagen synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
