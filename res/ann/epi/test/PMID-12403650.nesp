<sentence id="0">Group D prothrombin activators from snake venom are structural homologues of mammalian blood coagulation factor Xa .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Procoagulant venoms of several Australian elapids contain proteinases that specifically activate prothrombin ; among these , Group D activators are functionally similar to coagulation factor Xa ( FXa ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Structural information on this class of prothrombin activators will contribute significantly towards understanding the mechanism of FXa-mediated prothrombin activation .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we present the purification of Group D prothrombin activators from three Australian snake venoms ( Hoplocephalus stephensi , Notechis scutatus scutatus and Notechis ater niger ) using a single-step method , and their N-terminal sequences .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The N-terminal sequence of the heavy chain of hopsarin D ( H. stephensi ) revealed that a fully conserved Cys-7 was substituted with a Ser residue .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We therefore determined the complete amino acid sequence of hopsarin D. Hopsarin D shows approximately 70 % similarity with FXa and approximately 98 % similarity with trocarin D , a Group D prothrombin activator from Tropidechis carinatus .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">It possesses the characteristic Gla domain , two epidermal growth factor-like domains and a serine proteinase domain .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">All residues important for catalysis are conserved , as are most regions involved in interactions with factor Va and prothrombin .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , there are some structural differences .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Unlike FXa , hopsarin D is glycosylated in both its chains : in light-chain residue 52 and heavy-chain residue 45 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The glycosylation on the heavy chain is a large carbohydrate moiety adjacent to the active-site pocket .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Overall , hopsarin D is structurally and functionally similar to mammalian coagulation FXa .</sentence>
