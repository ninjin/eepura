<sentence id="0">CD44s adhesive function spontaneous and PMA-inducible CD44 cleavage are regulated at post-translational level in cells of melanocytic lineage .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Adhesion between the CD44s receptor and hyaluronic acid plays an important role in cell migration , tumour growth and progression .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although the alternative splicing of CD44 variant exons represents the principal regulatory mechanism of CD44-mediated functions , CD44v spliced variants are scantily expressed in melanoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">For this reason , we have investigated the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">possibility</cue> that post-translational modifications of the CD44 standard receptor could play a pivotal role in regulating CD44-mediated functions in melanoma</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using metabolic inhibitors of N- and O-glycosylation , as well as melanoma transfectants expressing CD44s O-glycosylation site-specific mutants , we performed structural and functional analysis of N- and O-deglycosylated CD44s molecules expressed in melanoma cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We discovered that <scope type="neg" id="1">complete N- and O-glycosylation is <cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> required by CD44s to be correctly expressed on the melanoma cell surface</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Indeed , variably glycosylated and functionally different CD44s molecules were constitutively expressed in primary and metastatic lesions .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , we observed that changes in N- and O-glycosylation of CD44s could modulate its cleavage .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In fact , spontaneous CD44s shedding was dependent on the presence of partial or complete O-glycosylation of four serine-glycine motifs localized in the membrane-proximal CD44 ectodomain .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Mutation of these serine residues , as well as an extensive metabolic O-deglycosylation , strongly impaired spontaneous CD44 shedding .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , an O-glycosylation-independent mechanism of CD44 cleavage has been identified .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">This alternative mechanism of receptor cleavage is phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) inducible , mediated by metalloproteinase and requires the presence of N-linked sugar residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our findings demonstrate that the post-translational modification of CD44s represents the principal regulatory mechanism of CD44s-mediated functions in melanoma .</sentence>
