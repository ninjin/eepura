<sentence id="0">Protein arginine methyltransferase I : substrate specificity and role in hnRNP assembly .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Prmt1 , the major protein arginine methyltransferase in mammalian cells , has been implicated in signal transduction , transcriptional control , and protein trafficking .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , mouse embryonic stem cells homozygous for an essentially null mutation in the Prmt1 gene were used to examine Prmt1 activity and substrate specificity , which by several criteria <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">appeared</cue> to be highly specific</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">First , other methyltransferases did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> substitute for the loss of Prmt1 activity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Second , almost all proteins modified by recombinant Prmt1 in vitro were authentic substrates , i.e. , proteins rendered hypomethylated by Prmt1 gene disruption .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Finally , Prmt1 did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> modify the substrates of other methyltransferases from cells treated with methyltransferase inhibitors</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Recombinant proteins corresponding to two splice-variants , Prmt1(353) and Prmt1(371) , methylated different , proteins in vitro , providing the first evidence for functional differences between the two isoforms .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">However , the differences in substrate specificity were lost by the addition of an N-terminal His(6) tag .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Loss of Prmt1 activity ( and hypomethylation of hnRNPs ) has <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> obvious effect on the formation or composition of hnRNP complexes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Finally , <scope type="spec" id="5"> methylation of the most abundant Prmt1 substrates <cue type="spec" id="5">appeared</cue> to be extensive and constitutive throughout the cell cycle , <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">suggesting</cue> the modification does <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> modulate protein function under normal growth conditions</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
