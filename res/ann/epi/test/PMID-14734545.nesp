<sentence id="0">Substrate requirements of the oxygen-sensing asparaginyl hydroxylase factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits 1 and 2 ( HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha ) are subjected to oxygen-dependent asparaginyl hydroxylation , a modification that represses the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain ( CAD ) at normoxia by preventing recruitment of the p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein coactivators .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This hydroxylation is performed by the novel asparaginyl hydroxylase , factor-inhibiting HIF-1 ' ( FIH-1 ) , of which HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are the only reported substrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Here we investigated the substrate requirements of FIH-1 by characterizing its subcellular localization and by examining amino acids within the HIF-1alpha substrate for their importance in recognition and catalysis by FIH-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Using immunohistochemistry , we showed that both endogenous and transfected FIH-1 are primarily confined to the cytoplasm and remain there under normoxia and following treatment with the hypoxia mimetic , dipyridyl .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Individual alanine mutations of seven conserved amino acids flanking the hydroxylated asparagine in HIF-1alpha revealed the importance of the valine ( Val-802 ) adjacent to the targeted asparagine .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The HIF-1alpha CAD V802A mutant exhibited a 4-fold lower V(max) in enzyme assays , whereas all other mutants were hydroxylated as efficiently as the wild type HIF-1alpha CAD .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , in cell-based assays the transcriptional activity of V802A was constitutive , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> negligible normoxic hydroxylation in HEK293T cells , whereas the wild type and other mutants were repressed under normoxia</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Molecular modeling of the HIF-1alpha CAD V802A in complex with FIH-1 predicted an alteration in asparagine positioning compared with the wild type HIF-1alpha CAD , providing an explanation for the impaired catalysis observed and confirming the importance of Val-802 in asparaginyl hydroxylation by FIH-1 .</sentence>
