<sentence id="0">Insulin resistance in denervated skeletal muscle .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Inability of insulin to stimulate dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase in denervated rat epitrochlearis muscles .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have investigated the effects of insulin and motor denervation on the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Rat epitrochlearis muscles were denervated in vivo 3 days before the contralateral and denervated muscles were incubated in vitro with 32Pi to label sites in glycogen synthase .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The 32P-labeled synthase was rapidly immunoprecipitated from extracts under conditions which prevented changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When 32P-labeled synthase from contralateral muscles was cleaved with CNBr , essentially all of the 32P was recovered in two fragments , denoted CB-1 and CB-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Incubating these muscles with insulin decreased the 32P content of each fragment by approximately 25 % , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating that</cue> the hormone stimulated dephosphorylation of at least two sites</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Peptide mapping by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography was performed to resolve phosphorylation sites more completely .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that the enzyme was phosphorylated in sites 1a , 1b , 2 , 3(a+b+c) , and 5</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Insulin stimulated dephosphorylation of sites in peptides presumed to contain sites 1b , 2 , and 3(a+b+c) .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Synthase from denervated muscles <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">appeared</cue> to contain the same amount of phosphate as enzyme from contralateral muscles</scope> , and denervation did <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> detectably affect the distribution of 32P within the subunit</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">However , denervation abolished the effect of insulin on decreasing the 32P content of synthase .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The results <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">indicate that</cue> the insulin resistance induced by denervation involves a loss in the ability of insulin to stimulate dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase</scope> .</sentence>
