<sentence id="0">The general secretory pathway of Klebsiella oxytoca : <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> evidence for relocalization or assembly of pilin-like PulG protein into a multiprotein complex</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">It has been proposed that the four type IV pilin-like proteins that are required for extracellular protein secretion by the general secretory pathway ( GSP ) <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> assemble into a trans-periplasm complex resembling a type IV pilus</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To test this idea , we examined the subcellular distribution and oligomeric state of PulG , one of the type IV pilin-like proteins required for pullulanase secretion in Klebsiella oxytoca .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Fractionation of Escherichia coli cells carrying a single copy of each pul gene showed that PulG protein was located in two distinct envelope fractions corresponding to the outer and cytoplasmic membranes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The protein was partially released by treating the membranes with Triton X-100 + EDTA or at high pH , but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> by Triton X-100 alone or by 8 M urea , 6 M guanidine hydrochloride or 1 M NaCl</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Like type IV pilins , non-sedimentable PulG that had been released from the membranes at high pH could be sedimented by centrifugation when the pH was lowered .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Treatment of whole cells , sphaeroplasts or isolated membranes with a cleavable cross-linking agent produced mainly PulG homodimers .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Previous studies showed that both PulO , which cleaves and N-methylates the PulG precursor , and PulE , a putative ATP-binding protein , share extensive sequence identity with proteins known to be required for type IV pilus processing and assembly .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">However , mutations which disrupted either pulE or pulO , or indeed the complete absence of all other components of the pullulanase secretion apparatus , had little or <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">no</cue> effect on any of the properties of PulG protein described above</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We conclude that there is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">no</cue> evidence that PulG protein assembles into a stable multiprotein complex or that processing of the PulG precursor causes a detectable change in its subcellular distribution</scope> .</sentence>
