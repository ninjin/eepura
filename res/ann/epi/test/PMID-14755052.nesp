<sentence id="0">Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation is required for DNA elimination in developing macronuclei in Tetrahymena .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Genome-wide DNA elimination accompanies development of the somatic macronucleus from the germ-line micronucleus during the sexual process of conjugation in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Small RNAs , referred to as " scan RNAs " ( scnRNAs ) , that accumulate only during conjugation are highly enriched in the eliminated sequences , and mutations that prevent DNA elimination also affect the accumulation of scnRNAs , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that an RNA interference (RNAi)-like mechanism is involved in DNA elimination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Histone H3 that is methylated at lysine 9 ( K9 ) is a hallmark of heterochromatin and , in Tetrahymena , is found only in developing macronuclei ( anlagen ) in association with chromatin containing the sequences undergoing elimination .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In this article , we demonstrate that a mutation in the TWI1 gene that eliminates the accumulation of scnRNAs also abolishes H3 methylation at K9 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We created mutant strains of Tetrahymena in which the only major H3 contained a K9Q mutation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">These mutants accumulated scnRNAs normally during conjugation but showed dramatically reduced efficiency of DNA elimination .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results provide strong genetic evidence linking an RNAi-like pathway , H3 K9 methylation , and DNA elimination in Tetrahymena .</sentence>
