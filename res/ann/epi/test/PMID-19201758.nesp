<sentence id="0">Protein phosphatase 2A contributes to the cardiac dysfunction induced by endotoxemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">AIMS : Sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction represents an intrinsic impairment of cardiomyocyte function due in part to a decrease in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity associated with a sustained increase in cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) phosphorylation at Ser23/24 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Dephosphorylation of cTnI is under regulatory control .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Thus , muscarinic and adenosine A(1)-receptor agonists antagonize beta-adrenergic stimulation via activation of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The aim of this study was to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> modulation of PP2A and thus cTnI phosphorylation <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">could</cue> improve sepsis-induced contractile dysfunction</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">METHODS AND RESULTS : Cardiomyocytes were isolated from control or septic mice 16-18 h after an injection of vehicle or lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; 9 mg/kg ip ) respectively .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Protein expression and phosphatase activity were determined in homogenates of control and septic hearts .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our data showed that LPS significantly increased cTnI phosphorylation at Ser23/24 in cardiomyocytes and reduced contraction amplitude <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">without</cue> affecting Ca(2+)-transients</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Treatment of cardiomyocytes with the A(1) agonist cyclopentyladenosine ( CPA ) or the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 significantly attenuated the LPS-induced contractile dysfunction <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> effect on Ca(2+)-transients</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Co-treatment with CPA and H89 completely reversed the contractile dysfunction .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Increased cTnI phosphorylation in septic hearts was associated with a significant reduction in the protein expression of both the catalytic and regulatory subunits ( B56 alpha ) of PP2A and a decrease in PP2A activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">CPA treatment of septic hearts increased PP2A activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">An increase in the protein expression of demethylated PP2A and a decrease in the PP2A-methyltransferase ( PPMT ; the methyltransferase that catalyses this reaction ) were also observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSION : These data <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">support</cue> the <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">hypothesis</cue> that sustained cTnI phosphorylation underlies the contractile dysfunction seen in sepsis</scope></scope> .</sentence>
