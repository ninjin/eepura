<sentence id="0">Drosophila stem cells share a common requirement for the histone H2B ubiquitin protease scrawny .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Stem cells within diverse tissues share the need for a chromatin configuration that promotes self-renewal , yet few chromatin proteins are known to regulate multiple types of stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We describe a Drosophila gene , scrawny ( scny ) , encoding a ubiquitin-specific protease , which is required in germline , epithelial , and intestinal stem cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Like its yeast relative UBP10 , Scrawny deubiquitylates histone H2B and functions in gene silencing .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Consistent with previous studies of this conserved pathway of chromatin regulation , scny mutant cells have elevated levels of ubiquitinylated H2B and trimethylated H3K4 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Our findings <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that inhibiting H2B ubiquitylation through scny represents a common mechanism within stem cells that is used to repress the premature expression of key differentiation genes , including Notch target genes</scope> .</sentence>
