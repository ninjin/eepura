<sentence id="0">Identification of 17,20beta,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one as an oocyte maturation-inducing steroid in black porgy , Acanthopagrus schlegeli .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The identity of the maturation-inducing steroid ( MIS ) in black porgy , Acanthopagrus schlegeli , a marine protandrous teleost , is unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies demonstrated that two teleost MISs , the progestins 17,20beta,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one ( 20beta-S ) and 17,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one ( DHP ) can induce maturation of black porgy oocytes in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The purpose of the present study was to identify the major progestin produced during oocyte maturation ( OM ) in black porgy and investigate <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> its secretion increases during this process</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Females were injected twice with a LHRH analog to induce OM .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Ovarian follicles undergoing OM were incubated in vitro with tritiated [3H]pregnenolone precursor and the tritiated products were extracted , purified , and identified by HPLC , TLC , acetylation , and recrystallization .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Significant amounts of tritiated products were biosynthesized from [3H]pregnenolone that co-migrated with 20beta-S but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> with DHP</scope> on HPLC and TLC .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Similar TLC profiles were obtained with the tritiated products isolated from the HPLC/TLC 20beta-S fraction and standard 20beta-S after the acetylation reaction .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The identity of the tritiated products as 20beta-S was confirmed by recrystallization .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">20beta-S had a slightly higher potency than DHP in the inducing in vitro final oocyte maturation .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Plasma 20beta-S concentrations increased significantly during the oocyte maturation after injection with a LHRH analog .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The present data <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that 20beta-S is the MIS in black porgy</scope> .</sentence>
