<sentence id="0">Regulation of acetylation at the major histocompatibility complex class II proximal promoter by the 19S proteasomal ATPase Sug1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Recent studies have made evident the fact that the 19S regulatory component of the proteasome has functions that extend beyond degradation , particularly in the regulation of transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Although 19S ATPases facilitate chromatin remodeling and acetylation events in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) , it is <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue> if they play similar roles in mammalian cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We have recently shown that the 19S ATPase Sug1 positively regulates the transcription of the critical inflammatory gene for major histocompatibility complex class II ( MHC-II ) by stabilizing enhanceosome assembly at the proximal promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We now show that Sug1 is crucial for regulating histone H3 acetylation at the MHC-II proximal promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Sug1 binds to acetylated histone H3 and , in the <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">absence</cue> of Sug1 , histone H3 acetylation</scope> is dramatically decreased at the proximal promoter , with a preferential loss of acetylation at H3 lysine 18 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Sug1 also binds to the MHC-II histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) and is critical for the recruitment of CBP to the MHC-II proximal promoter .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Our current study strongly implicates the 19S ATPase Sug1 in modifying histones to initiate MHC-II transcription and provides novel insights into the role of the proteasome in the regulation of mammalian transcription .</sentence>
