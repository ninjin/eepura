<sentence id="0">Genome-wide analysis reveals MOF as a key regulator of dosage compensation and gene expression in Drosophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Dosage compensation , mediated by the MSL complex , regulates X-chromosomal gene expression in Drosophila .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here we report that the histone H4 lysine 16 ( H4K16 ) specific histone acetyltransferase MOF displays differential binding behavior depending on <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the target gene is located on the X chromosome versus the autosomes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">More specifically , on the male X chromosome , where MSL1 and MSL3 are preferentially associated with the 3' end of dosage compensated genes , MOF displays a bimodal distribution binding to promoters and the 3' ends of genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , on MSL1/MSL3 independent X-linked genes and autosomal genes in males and females , MOF binds primarily to promoters .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Binding of MOF to autosomes is functional , as H4K16 acetylation and the transcription levels of a number of genes are affected upon MOF depletion .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Therefore , MOF is <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> only involved in the onset of dosage compensation</scope> , but also acts as a regulator of gene expression in the Drosophila genome .</sentence>
