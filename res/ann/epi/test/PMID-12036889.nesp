<sentence id="0">Tissue factor is the receptor for plasminogen type 1 on 1-LN human prostate cancer cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Tissue factor ( TF ) , the initiator of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation , binds plasminogen ( Pg ) with high affinity through an interaction between kringles 1-3 of Pg and the extracellular domain of TF .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We investigated the binding of Pg type 1 ( Pg 1 ) and Pg type 2 ( Pg 2 ) to highly invasive , TF-expressing , 1-LN human prostate tumor cells and to TF isolated from 1-LN cell membranes .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Pg 1 , containing both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide chains , bound to isolated TF with high affinity , whereas Pg 2 , containing only one O-linked oligosaccharide chain , did <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> bind to TF</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Although Pg 1 and Pg 2 bind to 1-LN cells , only anti-TF antibodies inhibited the binding of Pg 1 , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that TF functions as the receptor for Pg 1 on 1-LN cells</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Binding of Pg 1 to isolated TF was inhibited by 6-aminohexanoic acid and alpha-methylmannoside , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> that Pg 1 L-lysine binding sites and the biantennary , mannose-containing N-linked oligosaccharide chain are involved in this interaction</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Binding of Pg 1 to 1-LN cells promoted activation by receptor-bound urinary-type Pg activator ( u-PA ) and initiated a Ca(++) signaling cascade .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">In previous studies we demonstrated that the Pg 2 O-linked carbohydrate chain is essential for its binding to CD26 on 1-LN cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The current studies <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> that Pg oligosaccharide chains regulate the binding of Pg 1 and Pg 2 to separate receptors on the cell surface</scope> .</sentence>
