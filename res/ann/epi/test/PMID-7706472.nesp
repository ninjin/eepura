<sentence id="0">Pathways of processing of the gastrin precursor in rat antral mucosa .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The precursor of the acid-stimulating hormone gastrin gives rise to multiple peptides differing markedly in biological activity , but the relevant biosynthetic pathways are poorly understood .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have used antibodies to amidated gastrins , gastrins with COOH-terminal glycine ( Gly ) gastrins with COOH-terminal hydroxyglycine ( GlyOH ) and to the COOH terminus of progastrin , to immunoprecipitate peptides labeled with [35S]sulfate or [3H]tyrosine during incubation of rat antral mucosa in vitro .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Labeled progastrin was detectable after 30 min of continuous incubation with isotopic precursors , G34 and G34-Gly after 60 min , and G17 and G17-Gly after 120 min .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Pulse chase experiments <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> progastrin is converted to G34-Gly which then follows one of two pathways : ( a ) hydroxylation of COOH-terminal Gly and conversion to G34 followed by cleavage yielding G17 , or ( b ) cleavage to G17-Gly</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The kinetics of G17-Gly and G17 labeling were similar , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggesting</cue> that G17-Gly is a product in its own right , and not simply an intermediate in G17 synthesis</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Since the two peptides are reported to have distinct biological activities , <scope type="spec" id="2"> they <cue type="spec" id="2">appear</cue> to be alternative mature products of progastrin processing</scope> .</sentence>
