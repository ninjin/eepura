<sentence id="0">Glycation does <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> modify bovine serum albumin (BSA)-induced reduction of rat aortic relaxation</scope> : the response to glycated and nonglycated BSA is lost in metabolic syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The effects of nonglycated bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and advanced glycosylation end products of BSA ( AGE-BSA ) on vascular responses of control and metabolic syndrome ( MS ) rats characterized by hypertriglyceridemia , hypertension , hyperinsulinemia , and insulin resistance were studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Albumin and in vitro prepared AGE-BSA have vascular effects ; however , recent studies <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> some effects of in vitro prepared AGEs are due to the conditions in which they were generated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We produced AGEs by incubating glucose with BSA for 60 days under sterile conditions in darkness and at 37 degrees C. To develop MS rats , male Wistar animals were given 30 % sucrose in drinking water since weanling .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Six month old animals were used .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Blood pressure , insulin , triglycerides , and serum albumin were increased in MS rats .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Contraction of aortic rings elicited with norepinephrine was stronger .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">There were <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">no</cue> effects of nonglycated BSA or AGE-BSA on contractions in control or MS rats</scope> ; however , both groups responded to L-NAME , an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Arterial relaxation induced using acetylcholine was smaller in MS rats .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA significantly diminished relaxation in a 35 % in the control group but the decrease was similar when using nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This decrease was <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">not</cue> present in the MS rats</scope> and was <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> due to increased RAGEs or altered biochemical characteristics of BSA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">In conclusion , both BSA and AGE-BSA inhibit vascular relaxation in control artic rings .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">In MS rats the effect is lost <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">possibly</cue> due to alterations in endothelial cells that are a consequence of the illness</scope> .</sentence>
