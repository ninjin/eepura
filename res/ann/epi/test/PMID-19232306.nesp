<sentence id="0">Histone modifications dictate specific biological readouts .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosomal core particle , containing 147 bp of DNA that wraps twice around an octamer of core histones .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">The core histones bear a highly dynamic N-terminal amino acid tail around 20-35 residues in length and rich in basic amino acids .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">These tails extending from the surface of nucleosome play an important role in folding of nucleosomal arrays into higher order chromatin structure , which plays an important role in eukaryotic gene regulation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The amino terminal tails protruding from the nuclesomes get modified by the addition of small groups such as methyl , acetyl and phosphoryl groups .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">In this review , we focus on these complex modification patterns and their biological functions .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Moreover , <scope type="spec" id="0"> these modifications <cue type="spec" id="0">seem</cue> to be part of a complex scheme where distinct histone modifications act in a sequential manner or in combination to form a " histone code " read by other proteins to control the structure <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">and/or</cue> function of the chromatin fiber</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Errors in this histone code <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">may</cue> be involved in many human diseases especially cancer , the nature of which could be therapeutically exploited</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Increasing evidence <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggests</cue> that many proteins bear multiple , distinct modifications , and the ability of one modification to antagonize or synergize the deposition of another can have significant biological consequences</scope> .</sentence>
