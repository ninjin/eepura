<sentence id="0">Reductive activation of methanol : 5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase of Methanosarcina barkeri .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Methanol : 5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase ( MT1 ) from Methanosarcina barkeri , which is one of the enzymes responsible for the transmethylation from methanol to coenzyme M , was found to be activated in the presence of hydrogenase and ferredoxin .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This activation was shown to involve a reduction of the bound corrinoid to the Co ( I ) level , and was demonstrated by spectrophotometry and chemical conversion of reduced MT1 to its methylated form .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The reducing system of hydrogenase and ferredoxin was able to reduce dithiols , like dithiodiethanesulfonate and cystine to their monomers , in the presence of a corrinoid , which acts as an electron carrier .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The ferredoxin was purified 133-fold and was tentatively identified on the basis of spectral properties and iron content of 3.8-4.0 atoms iron per molecule ferredoxin ( 12,000 daltons ) .</sentence>
