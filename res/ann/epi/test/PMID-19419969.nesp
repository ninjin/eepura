<sentence id="1">The rough endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein complex consisting of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 ( P3H1 ) , cartilage-associated protein ( CRTAP ) , and cyclophilin B ( CypB ) can be isolated from chick embryos on a gelatin-Sepharose column , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicating</cue> some involvement in the biosynthesis of procollagens</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 modifies a single proline residue in the alpha chains of type I , II , and III collagens to (3S)-hydroxyproline .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilin B was shown previously to catalyze the rate of triple helix formation .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we show that cyclophilin B in the complex shows peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and that the P3H1.CRTAP.CypB complex has another important function : it acts as a chaperone molecule when tested with two classical chaperone assays .</sentence>
