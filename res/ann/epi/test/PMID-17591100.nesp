<sentence id="0">Clinical application of methylation specific-polymerase chain reaction in serum of patients with gastric cancer .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND/AIMS : We previously reported that aberrant methylation of p16 and/or E-cadherin genes in serum DNA <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> serve together as a tumor marker in gastric cancer</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We presently investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> sensitivity <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> be increased by consideration of a third gene , which encodes retinoic acid receptor-1 ( RARbeta )</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">METHODOLOGY : We performed a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ( MSP ) in serum DNA to detect aberrant methylation of RARbeta from 109 preoperative gastric cancer patients , in which the first two genes had been characterized .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">We also examined all three genes in sera from 10 outpatients during postgastrectomy follow-up .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RESULTS : Aberrant methylation of RARbeta was demonstrated in 26 preoperative patients ( 24 % ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Considering this with previous results , 52 patients ( 48 % ) of the 109 preoperative showed hypermethylation of at least one gene ( p16 , E-cadherin , and/or RARbeta ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7"><scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">No</cue> aberrant methylation was detected in control sera</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In the follow-up group , aberrant methylation was demonstrated in 2 of the 3 patients who had definite radiologic evidence of recurrences .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">One of the patients showing promoter hypermethylation <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">without</cue> definite findings of recurrence</scope> at the time of analysis developed peritoneal recurrence 6 months later .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">CONCLUSIONS : Including the MSP assay in conventional follow-up could facilitate early detection of recurrent disease in gastric cancer patients .</sentence>
