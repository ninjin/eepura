<sentence id="0">The E3 ubiquitin ligase TEB4 mediates degradation of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">The endoplasmic reticulum resident thyroid hormone-activating type 2 deiodinase ( D2 ) is inactivated by ubiquitination via the hedgehog-inducible WSB-1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Ubiquitinated D2 can then be subsequently taken up by the proteasomal system or be reactivated by USP-33/20-mediated deubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Given that heterologously expressed D2 accumulates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking the E3 ligase Doa10 , we tested <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the human Doa10 ortholog , TEB4 , plays a role in D2 ubiquitination and degradation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In a setting of transient coexpression in HEK-293 cells , TEB4 and D2 could be coimmunoprecipitated , and additional TEB4 expression decreased D2 activity by approximately 50 % ( P < 0.05 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">A highly efficient TEB4 knockdown ( > 90 % reduction in mRNA and protein levels ) decreased D2 ubiquitination and increased D2 activity and protein levels by about fourfold .</sentence>
<sentence id="6"><scope type="neg" id="2">The other activating <scope type="spec" id="3"> deiodinase , D1 , <cue type="spec" id="3">or</cue> a truncated D2 molecule ( Delta18-D2 ) that <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">lacks</cue> a critical instability domain</scope></scope> was <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> affected by TEB4 knockdown</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , TEB4 knockdown prolonged D2 activity half-life at least fourfold , even under conditions known to promote D2 ubiquitination .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Neither exposure to 1 microM of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 for 24 h <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">nor</cue> RNA interference WSB-1 knockdown</scope> resulted in additive effects on D2 expression when combined with TEB4 knockdown .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Similar results were obtained with MSTO-211 cells , which endogenously express D2 , after TEB4 knockdown using a lentivirus-based transduction strategy .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">While TEB4 expression predominates in the hematopoietic lineage , both WSB-1 and TEB4 are coexpressed with D2 in a number of tissues and cell types , except the thyroid and brown adipose tissue , where TEB4 expression is minimal .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">We conclude that TEB4 interacts with and mediates loss of D2 activity , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicating that</cue> D2 ubiquitination and degradation can be tissue specific , depending on WSB-1 and TEB4 expression levels</scope> .</sentence>
