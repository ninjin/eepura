<sentence id="0">Proteolysis of AKAP121 regulates mitochondrial activity during cellular hypoxia and brain ischaemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">A-kinase anchor protein 121 ( AKAP121 ) assembles a multivalent signalling complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane that controls persistence and amplitude of cAMP and src signalling to mitochondria , and plays an essential role in oxidative metabolism and cell survival .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , we show that AKAP121 levels are regulated post-translationally by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Seven In-Absentia Homolog 2 ( Siah2 ) , an E3-ubiquitin ligase whose expression is induced in hypoxic conditions , formed a complex and degraded AKAP121 .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In addition , we show that overexpression of Siah2 or oxygen and glucose deprivation ( OGD ) promotes Siah2-mediated ubiquitination and proteolysis of AKAP121 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Upregulation of Siah2 , by modulation of the cellular levels of AKAP121 , significantly affects mitochondrial activity assessed as mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative capacity .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Also during cerebral ischaemia , AKAP121 is degraded in a Siah2-dependent manner .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These findings reveal a novel mechanism of attenuation of cAMP/PKA signaling , which occurs at the distal sites of signal generation mediated by proteolysis of an AKAP scaffold protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">By regulating the stability of AKAP121-signalling complex at mitochondria , cells efficiently and rapidly adapt oxidative metabolism to fluctuations in oxygen availability .</sentence>
