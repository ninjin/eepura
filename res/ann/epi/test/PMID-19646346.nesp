<sentence id="1">OBJECTIVE : The glycosylation status of autoantigens <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">appears</cue> to be crucial for the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases</scope> , since carbohydrates play a crucial role in the distinction of self from non-self .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Proteinase 3 ( PR3 ) , the main target antigen for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ANCA ) in patients with Wegener 's granulomatosis ( WG ) , contains two Asn-linked glycosylation sites .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The present study explores the influence of the glycosylation status of PR3 on the PR3 recognition by ANCA in a well characterized population of patients with WG .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHODS : Forty-four patients with WG ( 459 serum samples ) who participated in a multicenter randomized trial , were tested by capture ELISA for ANCA against PR3 and deglycosylated recombinant variants of PR3 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">RESULTS : The patients were followed for a median of 27 months , and the median number of serum samples per patient was 10 .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">At baseline , the correlation between the levels of ANCA against PR3 and against all the deglycosylated recombinant variants of PR3 were greater than 0.94 ( ? < 0.001 for all the comparisons ) .</sentence>
