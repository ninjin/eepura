<sentence id="0">Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C augments Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation by deubiquitinating Mdm2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear antigen 3C ( EBNA3C ) is one of the essential latent antigens for primary B-cell transformation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Previous studies established that EBNA3C facilitates degradation of several vital cell cycle regulators , including the retinoblastoma ( pRb ) and p27(KIP) proteins , by recruitment of the SCF(Skp2) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">EBNA3C was also shown to be ubiquitinated at its N-terminal residues .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , EBNA3C can bind to and be degraded in vitro by purified 20S proteasomes .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Surprisingly , in lymphoblastoid cell lines , EBNA3C is extremely stable , and the mechanism for this stability is unknown .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In this report we show that EBNA3C can function as a deubiquitination enzyme capable of deubiquitinating itself in vitro as well as in vivo .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Functional mapping using deletion and point mutational analysis showed that both the N- and C-terminal domains of EBNA3C contribute to the deubiquitination activity .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We also show that EBNA3C efficiently deubiquitinates Mdm2 , an important cellular proto-oncogene , which is known to be overexpressed in several human cancers .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">The data presented here further demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of EBNA3C can bind to the acidic domain of Mdm2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Additionally , the N-terminal domain of EBNA3C strongly stabilizes Mdm2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Importantly , EBNA3C simultaneously binds to both Mdm2 and p53 and can form a stable ternary complex ; however , in the presence of p53 the binding affinity of Mdm2 toward EBNA3C was significantly reduced , <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggesting</cue> that p53 and Mdm2 <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">might</cue> share a common overlapping domain of EBNA3C</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We also showed that EBNA3C enhances the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 toward p53 , which in turn facilitated p53 ubiquitination and degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Thus , manipulation of the oncoprotein Mdm2 by EBNA3C <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">potentially</cue> provides a favorable environment for transformation and proliferation of EBV-infected cells</scope> .</sentence>
