T1001	Span 889 1177	suggests that CpG methylation-mediated direct interference with binding of nuclear factors LBF 2, 3, 7, AML1/LBF1, LBF5 and LBF6 or methylation of CpGs within an E-box sequence (where activators as well as repressors can bind) is not the major mechanism in silencing of the LMP 1 promoter
