<sentence id="2">About 2 mg purified protein could be obtained from 250 ml conditioned medium ; <scope type="spec" id="0"> multiple successive harvests <cue type="spec" id="0">could</cue> be obtained from the same roller bottle</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Degradation of proenkephalin released into the conditioned medium was reduced significantly in the presence of 2 % fetal bovine serum .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Forty-eight percent of recombinant proenkephalin was glycosylated ; glycosylation could be entirely prevented by the addition of tunicamycin .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing experiments showed that recombinant proenkephalin exhibited considerable charge heterogeneity , with two major unglycosylated isoelectric forms and six or seven glycosylated isoelectric forms .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The estimated isoelectric points of the major unglycosylated proenkephalins were 6.0 and 6.1 , while glycosylated proenkephalins ranged in pI from 5.7-6.1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Some of this isoelectric heterogeneity is due to phosphorylation ; [ 32P ] orthophosphate was readily incorporated into serine residues within newly synthesized proenkephalin .</sentence>
