Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C augments Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation by deubiquitinating Mdm2. 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is one of the essential latent antigens for primary B-cell transformation. Previous studies established that EBNA3C facilitates degradation of several vital cell cycle regulators, including the retinoblastoma (pRb) and p27(KIP) proteins, by recruitment of the SCF(Skp2) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. EBNA3C was also shown to be ubiquitinated at its N-terminal residues. Furthermore, EBNA3C can bind to and be degraded in vitro by purified 20S proteasomes. Surprisingly, in lymphoblastoid cell lines, EBNA3C is extremely stable, and the mechanism for this stability is unknown. In this report we show that EBNA3C can function as a deubiquitination enzyme capable of deubiquitinating itself in vitro as well as in vivo. Functional mapping using deletion and point mutational analysis showed that both the N- and C-terminal domains of EBNA3C contribute to the deubiquitination activity. We also show that EBNA3C efficiently deubiquitinates Mdm2, an important cellular proto-oncogene, which is known to be overexpressed in several human cancers. The data presented here further demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of EBNA3C can bind to the acidic domain of Mdm2. Additionally, the N-terminal domain of EBNA3C strongly stabilizes Mdm2. Importantly, EBNA3C simultaneously binds to both Mdm2 and p53 and can form a stable ternary complex; however, in the presence of p53 the binding affinity of Mdm2 toward EBNA3C was significantly reduced, suggesting that p53 and Mdm2 might share a common overlapping domain of EBNA3C. We also showed that EBNA3C enhances the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 toward p53, which in turn facilitated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, manipulation of the oncoprotein Mdm2 by EBNA3C potentially provides a favorable environment for transformation and proliferation of EBV-infected cells.
