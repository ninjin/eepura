<sentence id="1">Glucose-mediated oxidative stress and alterations in cyclooxygenase ( COX ) pathway activity with secondary deficits of endoneurial perfusion have been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental diabetic neuropathy ( EDN ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We have previously reported that activation of the COX-2 pathway is an important mediator of neurochemical and neurovascular defects in EDN in a rat model .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Considering that chemical COX inhibition <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">may</cue> exert other pharmacological effects in addition to inhibition of COX activity</scope> , the aim of this study was to explore the role of COX-2 in experimental diabetic neuropathy , using a COX-2 knockout mouse model .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Here we provide evidence that COX-2 inactivation had a protective effect against diabetes-induced motor and sensory nerve conduction slowing and impaired nerve antioxidative defense that were clearly manifest in the wild-type ( COX-2(+/+) ) diabetic mice .</sentence>
