<sentence id="0">Etiology of the metabolic syndrome : potential role of insulin resistance , leptin resistance , and other players .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Obesity and Type 2 diabetes are now major public health issues in developed nations and have reached epidemic proportions in many developing nations , as well as disadvantaged groups in developed countries , e.g. , Mexican-Americans , African-Americans , and Australian Aborigines .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">These groups all show hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance , <scope type="spec" id="0"> which have been demonstrated to be future predictors of Type 2 diabetes and have also been <cue type="spec" id="0">suggested</cue> as key factors in the etiology of the Metabolic Syndrome</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">It is now increasingly recognized that Type 2 diabetes is part of a cluster of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors comprising the Metabolic Syndrome .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This group is at very high risk of atherosclerosis because each of the risk factors in the Metabolic Syndrome cluster in its own right is an important CVD risk factor .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">They also contribute cumulatively to atherosclerosis .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A key strategy in reducing macrovascular disease lies in the better understanding of the Metabolic Syndrome--glucose intolerance , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and central obesity .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Although it has been <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggested</cue> that hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance is the central etiological factor for the Metabolic Syndrome</scope> , epidemiological data do <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> support the <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">idea</cue> that this can account for all of the cluster abnormalities</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We have animal and human data <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggesting</cue> that hyperleptinemia <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">rather than</cue> , or synergistically with</scope> , hyperinsulinemia <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">may</cue> play a central role in the genesis of the CVD risk factor cluster that constitutes the syndrome</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Studies in Psammomys obesus ( the Israeli sand rat ) <scope type="spec" id="7"> <cue type="spec" id="7">suggest</cue> hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance is an early metabolic lesion in the development of obesity and Type 2 diabetes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This animal also develops other features of the Metabolic Syndrome , making it an excellent model to investigate etiology .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Psammomys , when placed on an ad libitum laboratory diet , develops hyperinsulinemia , insulin resistance , impaired glucose tolerance , diabetes , and dyslipidemia .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">It also develops hyperleptinemia and leptin insensitivity , and hyperleptinemia is correlated with insulin resistance independent of changes in body weight .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">It is <scope type="spec" id="8"> <cue type="spec" id="8">likely</cue> that a similar sequence occurs in the transition from the prediabetic state to Type 2 diabetes in humans</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">More recently , <scope type="spec" id="9"> other potential players in the etiology of the Metabolic Syndrome have been <cue type="spec" id="9">suggested</cue> including endothelial dysfunction and acetylation-stimulating protein ( ASP )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">It has been <scope type="spec" id="10"> <cue type="spec" id="10">suggested</cue> that endothelial dysfunction <scope type="spec" id="11"> <cue type="spec" id="11">may</cue> be an antecedent for both Type 2 diabetes and the Metabolic Syndrome</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="16">In addition , ASP is a serious new candidate for an important role in insulin resistance .</sentence>
<sentence id="17">The ASP pathway plays a critical role in fatty acid metabolism and storage , and it has been <scope type="spec" id="12"> <cue type="spec" id="12">suggested</cue> that ineffective storage of fatty acids by adipocytes due to a defect in the ASP pathway <scope type="spec" id="13"> <cue type="spec" id="13">may</cue> lead to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes</scope></scope> .</sentence>
