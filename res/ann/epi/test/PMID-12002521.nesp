<sentence id="0">Geldanamycin inhibits trichostatin A-induced cell death and histone H4 hyperacetylation in COS-7 cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">As widely <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">believed</cue> treating cells with trichostatin A ( TSA ) , an inhibitor of histone deacetylase</scope> , results in histone H4 hyperacetylation and cell cycle arrest .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">This compound is often compared with other <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">potential</cue> anticancer drugs in cell cycle</scope> , proliferation and differentiation research .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Furthermore , geldanamycin ( GA ) , a 90-kDa heat shock protein ( HSP90 ) specific inhibitor , is a well-known potential anticancer agent .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This study examines <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">whether</cue> GA can affect the cellular functions induced by TSA</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">When using TSA treatment , although caused COS-7 cell death , pretreatment of 0.5 microg/ml GA for 30 min and an addition of 50 ng/ml TSA ( GA + TSA ) apparently averted cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Our results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicated that</cue> the cell survival rate was only approximately 20 % when prolonged treatment was undertaken with 50 ng/ml TSA ( TSA ) alone for 24 h. In contrast</scope> , the cell survival rate was enhanced by two folds when treating with GA + TSA .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Furthermore , DNA fragmentation assay revealed that fragmented DNA was produced 8 h after prolonged treatment with TSA alone .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Within 16 h , the apoptotic percentages of TSA-treated cells were between 15-25 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">In contrast , the other treatments did <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> exceed 6 %</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Furthermore , GA inhibited TSA-induced histone H4 hyperacetylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Western blotting analysis further demonstrated that the HSP70 levels did not significantly increase in TSA-treated cells .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">However , the accumulated 70-kDa heat shock protein ( HSP70 ) markedly increased up to 2 to 3 folds at 8 h in GA- and GA + TSA-treated cells , and the maximum amount up to 5 to 7 folds at 20 h. Conversely , HSP90 did not markedly increase in all treatments .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Based on the results in this study , we <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">suggest</cue> that apoptosis induced by TSA can be prevented by GA-induced increment of heat shock proteins , particularly HSP70</scope> .</sentence>
