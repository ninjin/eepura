<sentence id="0">Negative regulation of the SH2-homology containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 ( SHP-1 ) P2 promoter by the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Expression of SH(2)-homology-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 ( SHP-1 ) , a candidate tumor suppressor , is repressed in human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1)-transformed lymphocyte cell lines , adult T-cell leukemia ( ATL ) cells , and in other hematologic malignancies .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">However , the mechanisms underlying regulation and repression of SHP-1 remain unclear .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Herein , we cloned the <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">putative</cue> full-length , hematopoietic</scope> cell-specific SHP-1 P2 promoter and identified the " core " promoter regions .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">HTLV-1 Tax profoundly represses P2 promoter activity and histone deacetylase-1 ( HDAC1 ) potentiates such inhibition .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">NF-kappaB was implicated as both a rate-limiting factor for basal P2 promoter activity and important for Tax-induced promoter silencing ( TIPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that NF-kappaB dissociates from the SHP-1 P2 promoter following the binding of Tax and HDAC1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">This is in agreement with coimmunoprecipitation studies where NF-kappaB competed with HDAC1 for association with Tax protein .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">We <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">propose</cue> that in TIPS , Tax recruits HDAC1 to the SHP-1 P2 promoter and forms an inhibitory complex that results in deacetylation and dissociation of NF-kappaB from the promoter and attenuation of SHP-1 expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">TIPS provides a <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">possible</cue> first step toward HTLV-1 leukemogenesis</scope> through its down-modulation of this key immediate early negative regulator of IL-2 signaling .</sentence>
