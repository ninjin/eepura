<sentence id="0">IgE receptor on human lymphocytes .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">IV .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Further analysis of its structure and of the role of N-linked carbohydrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Previous studies have shown that the low affinity receptor for IgE ( Fc epsilon R II ) on human B lymphocytes was comprised of three components with apparent Mr of 45 , 65 to 95 , and 37 kDa .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The present results <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate that</cue> the 37-kDa component is a soluble degradation fragment of the 45-kDa component and they also <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">suggest</cue> that <scope type="spec" id="2"> the 65- to 95-kDa component is <cue type="spec" id="2">probably</cue> made of aggregates of the above components that are formed after solubilization of the cells</scope></scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5"><scope type="spec" id="3"> The 45-kDa component <cue type="spec" id="3">appears</cue> to be a glycoprotein containing several sialic acid residues , O-linked carbohydrates and one N-linked carbohydrate chain that is of the complex type</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Partial digestion of the purified 65- to 95- , 45- , and 37-kDa molecules with alpha-chymotrypsin or protease V8 generates several fragments with identical mobility on SDS-PAGE .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">The 37 kDa is <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> N-glycosylated</scope> but like the IgE-binding factors present in the culture supernatant of Fc epsilon R-bearing cells , it contains sialic acid and O-linked carbohydrates .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">On incubation with protease inhibitors , the Mr of IgE-binding factors ( BF ) is shifted from 25-27 to 37 kDa , <scope type="spec" id="5"> <cue type="spec" id="5">indicating that</cue> IgE-BF are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the 37-kDa molecule , previously identified as a membrane component of Fc epsilon R. On incubation with N-glycosylation inhibitors , the production of IgE-BF is significantly increased <scope type="spec" id="6"> <cue type="spec" id="6">indicating that</cue> N-glycosylation inhibits the degradation of Fc epsilon R into IgE-BF</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Inasmuch as <scope type="neg" id="7">the effect of glycosylation inhibitors is <cue type="neg" id="7">not</cue> prevented by monensin</scope> , it is concluded that all the IgE-BF are derived from surface Fc epsilon R and <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">not</cue> from their intracellular precursors</scope> .</sentence>
