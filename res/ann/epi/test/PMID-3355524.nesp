<sentence id="0">Underhydroxylated minor cartilage collagen precursors cannot form stable triple helices .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Matrix-free cells from chick-embryo sterna were incubated with various concentrations of 2,2'-bipyridyl , an iron chelator that inhibits prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">At concentrations in the region of 0.1 mM , significant effects on cartilage collagen hydroxylation and secretion were observed .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">When the underhydroxylated collagens were subsequently digested with chymotrypsin or chymotrypsin plus trypsin at 4 degrees C for 15 min , the minor cartilage collagen precursors ( namely types IX and XI ) were extensively degraded ; type II procollagen was only partially susceptible and was converted into underhydroxylated collagen .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">The results demonstrate that there were significant differences in triple-helix stability among cartilage collagens such that the underhydroxylated minor collagen precursors were <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">unable</cue> to attain a native structure under conditions where type II procollagen was successful</scope> .</sentence>
