<sentence id="0">Role of prolyl hydroxylation in oncogenically stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) protein is essential for its role as a regulator of gene expression under low oxygen conditions .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Here , employing a novel hydroxylation-specific antibody , we directly show that proline 564 of HIF-1alpha and proline 531 of HIF-2alpha are hydroxylated under normoxia .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Importantly , HIF-1alpha Pro-564 and HIF-2alpha Pro-531 hydroxylation is diminished with the treatment of hypoxia , cobalt chloride , desferrioxamine , or dimethyloxalyglycine , regardless of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) tumor suppressor gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Furthermore , in VHL-deficient cells , HIF-1alpha Pro-564 and HIF-2alpha Pro-531 had detectable amounts of hydroxylation following transition to hypoxia , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the post-translational modification is <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">not</cue> reversible</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The introduction of v-Src or RasV12 oncogenes resulted in the stabilization of normoxic HIF-1alpha and the loss of hydroxylated Pro-564 , demonstrating that oncogene-induced stabilization of HIF-1alpha is signaled through the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Conversely , a constitutively active Akt oncogene stabilized HIF-1alpha under normoxia independently of prolyl hydroxylation , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggesting</cue> an alternative mechanism for HIF-1alpha stabilization</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Thus , these results <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">indicate</cue> distinct pathways for HIF-1alpha stabilization by different oncogenes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">More importantly , these findings link oncogenesis with normoxic HIF-1alpha expression through prolyl hydroxylation .</sentence>
