<sentence id="0">Disease-associated mutant ubiquitin causes proteasomal impairment and enhances the toxicity of protein aggregates .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Protein homeostasis is critical for cellular survival and its dysregulation has been implicated in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and other neurodegenerative disorders .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Despite the growing appreciation of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in familial forms of AD , much less is known about the sporadic cases .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Aggregates found in both familial and sporadic AD often include proteins other than those typically associated with the disease .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">One such protein is a mutant form of ubiquitin , UBB+1 , a frameshift product generated by molecular misreading of a wild-type ubiquitin gene .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">UBB+1 has been associated with multiple disorders .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">UBB+1 cannot function as a ubiquitin molecule , and it is itself a substrate for degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system ( UPS ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Accumulation of UBB+1 impairs the proteasome system and enhances toxic protein aggregation , ultimately resulting in cell death .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Here , we describe a novel model system to investigate how UBB+1 impairs UPS function and <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> it plays a causal role in protein aggregation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We expressed a protein analogous to UBB+1 in yeast ( Ub(ext) ) and demonstrated that it caused UPS impairment .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Blocking ubiquitination of Ub(ext) or weakening its interactions with other ubiquitin-processing proteins reduced the UPS impairment .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Expression of Ub(ext) altered the conjugation of wild-type ubiquitin to a UPS substrate .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">The expression of Ub(ext) markedly enhanced cellular susceptibility to toxic protein aggregates but , surprisingly , did <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> induce or alter nontoxic protein aggregates in yeast</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">Taken together , these results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that Ub(ext) interacts with more than one protein to elicit impairment of the UPS and affect protein aggregate toxicity</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">Furthermore , we <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">suggest</cue> a model whereby chronic UPS impairment could inflict deleterious consequences on proper protein aggregate sequestration</scope> .</sentence>
