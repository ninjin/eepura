<sentence id="0">Identification and characterization of a sixth structural protein of Lelystad virus : the glycoprotein GP2 encoded by ORF2 is incorporated in virus particles .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Previously we have shown that Lelystad virus ( LV ) contains five structural proteins , a nucleocapsid protein N , an integral membrane protein M , and three glycoproteins GP3 , GP4 , and GP5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In this study we identified a sixth structural protein of Lelystad virus .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 29 to 30 kDa , was recognized by an ORF2-specific antipeptide serum in Western immunoblotting using sucrose gradient purified LV virions , and was shown to be N-glycosylated .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">It was therefore designated GP2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The GP2 protein was also immunoprecipitated by ORF2-specific antipeptide serum from lysates and extracellular virus of CL2621 cells infected with LV .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A fraction of the GP2 protein present in these lysates contained an intrachain disulfide bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Endoglycosidase H treatment of immunoprecipitates <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicated that</cue> the endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans of the GP2 protein become endoglycosidase H-resistant during passage through the Golgi compartment in cells infected with LV</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In contrast , the N-glycans of the GP2 protein expressed individually in a recombinant Semliki Forest virus remained endoglycosidase H-sensitive , <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicating that</cue> the GP2 protein was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">LV is the first arterivirus which has been demonstrated to contain six virion-associated proteins , one nucleocapsid protein , one integral membrane protein , and four glycoproteins .</sentence>
