<sentence id="0">Mevalonate-regulated mechanisms in cell growth control : role of dolichyl phosphate in expression of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) in comparison to Ras prenylation and expression of c-myc .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">One or more mevalonate derivatives of non-sterol type have been proposed to be of indispensable importance for cell growth .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Conceivable mevalonate-dependent mechanisms involved in growth control are farnesylation of Ras proteins , regulation of c-myc expression , and N-linked glycosylation of the IGF-1 receptor .</sentence>
<sentence id="3"><scope type="spec" id="0"> The latter mechanism <cue type="spec" id="0">might</cue> be rate-limited by dolichyl phosphate</scope> , which acts as a donor of oligosaccharides in glycoprotein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In order to study the significance for cell proliferation of the three aforementioned mevalonate-dependent processings , their inhibitory response due to mevalonate deprivation was explored and compared with the effect on DNA synthesis in the malignant melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">We found that mevalonate depletion due to treatment with 3 microM lovastatin for 24 h , which efficiently growth-arrested the cells , hardly at all affected the expression of c-myc , and although Ras prenylation was inhibited by 50 % , the most pronounced effect of lovastatin was seen on N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1 receptors , which was inhibited by more than 95 % .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">The order and magnitude of the decreased IGF-1 receptor glycosylation , which was followed by a decreased expression of IGF-1 receptors at the cell membrane , correlated well with the inhibition of DNA synthesis .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">We investigated <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">whether</cue> dolichol , and in particular dolichyl phosphate , through its participation in N-linked glycosylation , act as regulators of IGF-1 receptor expression</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">First , we could confirm that exogenous dolichol became phosphorylated and in this form took part in the glycosylation processing .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Secondly , we showed that dolichyl phosphate , in a dose-dependent manner , <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">could</cue> increase the number of IGF-1 receptors at the cell membrane , simultaneously as DNA synthesis was stimulated</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Taken together , our results provide direct evidence for an important role of dolichyl phosphate as a regulator of cell growth through limiting N-linked glycosylation of the IGF-1 receptor .</sentence>
