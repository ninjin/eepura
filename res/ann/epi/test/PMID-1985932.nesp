<sentence id="0">Occurrence of sulfate in an asparagine-linked complex oligosaccharide of chicken adipose lipoprotein lipase .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">After adipocytes were labeled with Na2[35SO4 ] , immunoadsorbed with immobilized antilipoprotein lipase , and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) and fluorography , a labeled band was identified at 59,700 daltons , the molecular mass of chicken lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">Excess unlabeled LPL prevented the immunoadsorption of this labeled species , hence the labeled species was determined to be LPL .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Digestion of LPL with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H ( Endo H ) caused a shift in mobility of LPL in SDS-PAGE with <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> loss of radioactivity</scope> , whereas digestion with glycopeptidase F resulted in removal of 99 % of the radioactivity .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Adipocytes cultured with Trans35S-label and tunicamycin produced an LPL species of 52,000 daltons , but tunicamycin abolished the incorporation of 35SO4 into LPL .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">This established that 35SO4 was incorporated into an N-linked oligosaccharide of LPL .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Endo H digestion of pulse-chase labeled LPL revealed the presence of two complex and one high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">A single 35SO4-labeled tryptic peptide was isolated by reverse phase chromatography .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">The amino acid sequence of the peptide established that the 35SO4 oligosaccharide is conjugated at Asn-45 .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Behavior of the 35SO4-labeled oligosaccharide on concanavalin A-agarose , sequential exoglycosidase digestion , and chemical analysis of the 35SO4 oligosaccharide confirms that this moiety is of the complex type .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">Sequential exoglycosidase digestion , thin layer chromatography of the released monosaccharides , and the use of glycosylation inhibitors established that the sulfated sugar is a core N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">The data show that chicken LPL contains two complex and one high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides and that 35SO4 is incorporated into LPL on a GlcNAc residue of a complex oligosaccharide located at Asn-45 .</sentence>
