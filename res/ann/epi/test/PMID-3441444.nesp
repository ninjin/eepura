<sentence id="0">N-acetylated endorphins in ovine anterior pituitary and neuro-intermediate lobe .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have used an antiserum for immunohistochemistry and RIA/RP-HPLC which recognizes all fragments of N-acetylated endorphin ( NacEP ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the rat neuro-intermediate lobe ( N-IL ) , in addition to the N-acetylated forms of immunoreactive-beta-endorphin ( ir-beta EP ) already reported , we have demonstrated Nac beta EP as a minor component .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">In the sheep pituitary processing of beta EP is markedly different .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In the anterior pituitary ( AP ) , staining was indistinguishable with beta EP and NacEP antisera , in contrast with the rat where many fewer AP cells stained with the NacEP antiserum .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Secondly , as in the rat , all N-IL cells stained with both antisera ; on RP-HPLC , however , the major forms of NacEP in the sheep N-IL were Nac beta EP ( approximately 40 % ) , Nac beta EP ( approximately 25 % ) and Nac beta EP ( approximately 20 % ) , with Nac beta EP ( approximately 2 % ) as a minor component .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">A similar profile was seen on RP-HPLC of sheep AP .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These data <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">suggest</cue> that ( 1 ) patterns of processing in sheep AP are similar to those in N-IL</scope> , though the extent of acetylation is less and ( 2 ) in the sheep pituitary low molecular weight acetylated fragments predominate , in contrast with the rat .</sentence>
