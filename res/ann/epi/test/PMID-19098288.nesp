<sentence id="0">Suppression of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP5 causes the accumulation of unanchored polyubiquitin and the activation of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">Both p53 and its repressor Mdm2 are subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">We show that knockdown of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP5 ( isopeptidase T ) results in an increase in the level and transcriptional activity of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Suppression of USP5 stabilizes p53 , whereas it has little or <scope type="neg" id="0"><cue type="neg" id="0">no</cue> effect on the stability of Mdm2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">This provides a mechanism for transcriptional activation of p53 .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">USP5 knockdown interferes with the degradation of ubiquitinated p53 <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">rather than</cue> attenuating p53 ubiquitination</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">In vitro studies have shown that a preferred substrate for USP5 is unanchored polyubiquitin .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">Consistent with this , we observed for the first time in a mammalian system that USP5 makes a major contribution to Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin disassembly and that suppression of USP5 results in the accumulation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">Ectopic expression of a C-terminal mutant of ubiquitin ( G75A/G76A ) , which also causes the accumulation of free polyubiquitin , recapitulates the effects of USP5 knockdown on the p53 pathway .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">We <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">propose</cue> a model in which p53</scope> is selectively stabilized because the unanchored polyubiquitin that accumulates after USP5 knockdown is able to compete with ubiquitinated p53 but <scope type="neg" id="2"><cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> with Mdm2 for proteasomal recognition</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">This <scope type="spec" id="4"> <cue type="spec" id="4">raises the</cue> possibility that there are significant differences in proteasomal recognition of p53 and Mdm2</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">These differences could be exploited therapeutically .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">Our study reveals a novel mechanism for regulation of p53 and identifies USP5 as a potential target for p53 activating therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer .</sentence>
