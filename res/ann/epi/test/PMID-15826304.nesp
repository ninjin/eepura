<sentence id="0">Myeloid antigens in childhood lymphoblastic leukemia : clinical data point to regulation of CD66c distinct from other myeloid antigens .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">BACKGROUND : Aberrant expression of myeloid antigens ( MyAgs ) on acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cells is a well-documented phenomenon , although <scope type="spec" id="0"> its regulating mechanisms are <cue type="spec" id="0">unclear</cue></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">MyAgs in ALL are interpreted e.g. as hallmarks of early differentiation stage and/or lineage indecisiveness .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Granulocytic marker CD66c -- Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 ( CEACAM6 ) is aberrantly expressed on ALL with strong correlation to genotype ( negative in TEL/AML1 and MLL/AF4 , positive in BCR/ABL and hyperdiploid cases ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">METHODS : In a cohort of 365 consecutively diagnosed Czech B-precursor ALL patients , we analyze distribution of MyAg+ cases and mutual relationship among CD13 , CD15 , CD33 , CD65 and CD66c .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">The most frequent MyAg ( CD66c ) is studied further regarding its stability from diagnosis to relapse , prognostic significance and regulation of surface expression .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">For the latter , flow cytometry , Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR on sorted cells is used .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">RESULTS : We show CD66c is expressed in 43 % patients , which is more frequent than other MyAgs studied .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">In addition , CD66c expression negatively correlates with CD13 ( p < 0.0001 ) , CD33 ( p = 0.002 ) and/or CD65 ( p = 0.029 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Our data show that different myeloid antigens often differ in biological importance , <scope type="spec" id="1"> which <cue type="spec" id="1">may</cue> be obscured by combining them into " MyAg positive ALL "</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">We show that <scope type="neg" id="2">unlike other MyAgs , CD66c expression is <cue type="neg" id="2">not</cue> shifted from the onset of ALL to relapse ( n = 39 , time to relapse 0.3-5.3 years )</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="11">Although <scope type="spec" id="6"> opposite has previously been <cue type="spec" id="6">suggested</cue></scope> , we show that CEACAM6 transcription is invariably followed by surface expression ( by quantitative RT-PCR on sorted cells ) and that malignant cells containing CD66c in cytoplasm <scope type="neg" id="3"><cue type="neg" id="3">without</cue> surface expression</scope> are <scope type="neg" id="4"><cue type="neg" id="4">not</cue> found by flow cytometry <scope type="neg" id="5"><cue type="neg" id="5">nor</cue> by Western blot in vivo</scope></scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="12">We report <scope type="neg" id="7"><cue type="neg" id="7">no</cue> prognostic significance of CD66c</scope> , globally or separately in genotype subsets of B-precursor ALL , <scope type="neg" id="8"><cue type="neg" id="8">nor</cue> an association with known risk factors</scope> ( n = 254 ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="13">CONCLUSION : In contrast to general <scope type="spec" id="9"> <cue type="spec" id="9">notion</cue> we show that different MyAgs in lymphoblastic leukemia represent different biological circumstances</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="14">We chose the most frequent and tightly genotype-associated MyAg CD66c to show its stabile expression in patients from diagnosis to relapse , which differs from what is known on the other MyAgs .</sentence>
<sentence id="15">Surface expression of CD66c is regulated at the gene transcription level , in contrast to previous reports .</sentence>
