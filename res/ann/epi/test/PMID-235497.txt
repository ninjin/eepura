Synthesis and charge-transfer properties of two acth analogues containing pentamethylphenylalanine in position 9. 
In order to investigate the possible role of the Trp residue in ACTH as a change-transfer donor in the activation of ACTH receptors, two ACTH analogues (beta-corticotrophins (I-24) with L-Ser1 and D-Ser1, respectively) containing pentamethylphenylalanine instead of Trp have been synthesized. In these syntheses a new, alkaline-labile, amino-protecting group, the methylsulphonylethyloxycarbonyl group, was employed. The association constants of ACTH (I-24) and (Pmp9)-ACTH (I-24) with the water-soluble acceptor paraquat, were nearly equal.
