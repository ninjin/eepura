<sentence id="1">Promoter-region DNA methylation inhibits transcription .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">A two-stage SENCAR ( sensitive to mouse carcinogenesis ) mouse skin carcinogenicity model was used to examine gene-specific changes in methylation during skin tumor promotion .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">Analysis was performed on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated skin promoted with 9 , 18 , 27 , or 36 mg cigarette smoke condensate ( CSC ) for 9 wk , or 27 mg CSC for 9 wk and sacrificed 6 wk afterwards ( recovery group ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Additionally , tumors arising following promotion with 27 mg CSC for 29 wk were assessed .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Gene array analysis identified differentially expressed genes .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Expression of HoxA5 , a tumor suppressor gene , was decreased following 9 wk of treatment with 27 mg CSC , and returned to control levels during recovery .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">HoxA5 promoter methylation was measured with the enzymatic regional methylation assay ( ERMA ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="8">DNA was bisulfite-modified , PCR-amplified with primers containing dam sites , incubated with [ 14C-methyl ] S-adenosyl-L-methionine ( SAM ) and dam methyltransferase for DNA quantification , then incubated with [ 3H-methyl ] SAM and SssI methylase to quantify methylation status .</sentence>
<sentence id="9">Higher 3H/14C ratios <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">indicate</cue> increased methylation</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="10">The 3H/14C ratios of animals promoted with 27 or 36 mg CSC ( 48.2 +/- 6.9 and 24.2 +/- 6.1 , respectively ) were higher than the control or recovery group ratios ( 12.3 +/- 0.1 and 12.6 +/- 0.3 , respectively ) ; sequence analysis supported these findings .</sentence>
