<sentence id="0">Methylation status of immunoglobulin kappa gene segments correlates with their recombination potential .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously shown that unlike endogenous chi genes , unrearranged chi transgenes undergo V chi-J chi recombination in Tas well as B cells of transgenic mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">To determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> the difference in recombination specificity of the transgenic and endogenous chi genes is associated with differences in DNA structure</scope> , the methylation status of the endogenous genes and three unrearranged chi transgenes was compared .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">The J chi-C chi locus of the transgenes was found to be hypomethylated in all tissues of the transgenic mice .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">In contrast , methylation of the endogenous chi genes was tissue and developmentally regulated .</sentence>
<sentence id="5">Hypomethylation of the endogenous J chi-C chi region occurs only in cells of the B lineage undergoing , or having completed chi gene recombination .</sentence>
<sentence id="6">Transfection of fibroblasts from transgenic and control mice with the recombination activating genes , Rag1 and Rag2 , led to a high level of rearrangement of the hypomethylated transgenic , but <scope type="neg" id="1"><cue type="neg" id="1">not</cue> the endogenous chi genes</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="7">These results <scope type="spec" id="2"> <cue type="spec" id="2">suggest</cue> that hypomethylation defines an accessible state of the chi locus and that methylation/demethylation <scope type="spec" id="3"> <cue type="spec" id="3">could</cue> be involved in the control of chi gene rearrangement during lymphocyte differentiation</scope></scope> .</sentence>
