The general secretory pathway of Klebsiella oxytoca: no evidence for relocalization or assembly of pilin-like PulG protein into a multiprotein complex. 
It has been proposed that the four type IV pilin-like proteins that are required for extracellular protein secretion by the general secretory pathway (GSP) might assemble into a trans-periplasm complex resembling a type IV pilus. To test this idea, we examined the subcellular distribution and oligomeric state of PulG, one of the type IV pilin-like proteins required for pullulanase secretion in Klebsiella oxytoca. Fractionation of Escherichia coli cells carrying a single copy of each pul gene showed that PulG protein was located in two distinct envelope fractions corresponding to the outer and cytoplasmic membranes. The protein was partially released by treating the membranes with Triton X-100 + EDTA or at high pH, but not by Triton X-100 alone or by 8 M urea, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride or 1 M NaCl. Like type IV pilins, non-sedimentable PulG that had been released from the membranes at high pH could be sedimented by centrifugation when the pH was lowered. Treatment of whole cells, sphaeroplasts or isolated membranes with a cleavable cross-linking agent produced mainly PulG homodimers. Previous studies showed that both PulO, which cleaves and N-methylates the PulG precursor, and PulE, a putative ATP-binding protein, share extensive sequence identity with proteins known to be required for type IV pilus processing and assembly. However, mutations which disrupted either pulE or pulO, or indeed the complete absence of all other components of the pullulanase secretion apparatus, had little or no effect on any of the properties of PulG protein described above. We conclude that there is no evidence that PulG protein assembles into a stable multiprotein complex or that processing of the PulG precursor causes a detectable change in its subcellular distribution.
