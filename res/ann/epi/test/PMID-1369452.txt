Regulated expression allows high level production and secretion of HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein in Drosophila Schneider cells. 
We have established a stable, continuous culture Drosophila Schneider 2 cell line that efficiently expresses a secreted, truncated form of the HIV envelope gp120 protein in a regulated manner. The Drosophila produced recombinant gp120 protein is highly glycosylated, is recognized by gp120-specific monoclonal antibodies, binds to the CD4 receptor and has the ability to inhibit syncytia formation between uninfected CD4+ cells and HIV infected cells. We conclude that this recombinant Drosophila envelope protein is an appropriate mimic of the authentic viral envelope protein. Thus, the Drosophila cell provides a continuous, stable culture system for the efficient expression of secreted forms of complex surface glycoproteins in quantities sufficient for detailed analyses.
