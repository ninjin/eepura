<sentence id="0">Methylation of NMDA receptor NR2B gene as a function of age in the mouse brain .</sentence>
<sentence id="1">We have previously reported that there is an up-regulation of the NR2B gene expression in the adult cortex and cultured fetal cortical neurons of mice following chronic ethanol treatment due to demethylation of cytosine residues in the NR2B gene CpG island .</sentence>
<sentence id="2">In the present study , we investigated the methylation pattern of the NR2B CpG island as a function of the mouse age by digesting the cortex genomic DNA with HpaII enzyme , amplifying the interested regions by performing PCR and detecting the methylated regions by Southern hybridization so as to determine <scope type="spec" id="0"> <cue type="spec" id="0">whether</cue> age affects the methylation process</scope> .</sentence>
<sentence id="3">We observed demethylation of various regions of NR2B gene ( 5227-5567 ) , ( 5647-6003 ) , ( 6091-6445 ) , ( 6424-7024 ) of adult mouse cortex .</sentence>
<sentence id="4">Our results <scope type="spec" id="1"> <cue type="spec" id="1">indicate that</cue> methylation of NR2B gene in the mouse brain is age-dependent phenomenon</scope> .</sentence>
